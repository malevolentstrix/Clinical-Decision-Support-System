The underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear, especially in early life during critical windows of development and maturation. This study investigated the association of antenatal maternal depression, maternal and early life inflammatory markers and neurodevelopmental outcomes in children at 2 years of age.MethodsA subgroup of mothers and their children (n = 255) that were enrolled in a South African birth cohort study, the Drakenstein Child Health Study, were followed from the antenatal period through to 2 years of child age. Maternal depressive symptoms were measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at 26 weeks gestation. Serum inflammatory markers [granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9)] were measured in mothers at enrolment and in their children at 6–10 weeks and at 2 years. Neurodevelopment was assessed at 2 years using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development III.ResultsAntenatal depressive symptoms (present in 25% of the mothers) were significantly associated with higher levels of IL-7 (p = 0.008), IL-8 (p = 0.019) and TNF-α (p = 0.031) in the mothers after correcting for sociodemographic and lifestyle factors. Serum IL-1β and NGAL levels were significantly elevated over time in children born to mothers with depressive symptoms compared to those without depression, after controlling for maternal and child health and sociodemographic factors. Elevated infant IL-1β at 6–10 weeks of age partially mediated the association of maternal depressive symptoms with poorer language scores at 2 years.ConclusionAlterations in early life immunity, as reflected by elevated IL-1β, is a potential pathway through which antenatal maternal depressive symptoms may impact language development in young children.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsPrenatalInflammationCytokinesOffspringDepressionLongitudinalRecommended articlesCited by (0)© 2022 The Authors.
