Ensuring that women receive antenatal care from a skilled provider may play an important role in reducing this burden.OBJECTIVEThis study aimed to determine whether antenatal care received from a skilled provider could reduce neonatal mortality in Southern Asia by systematically reviewing existing evidence.STUDY DESIGNSeven databases were searched (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PubMed, PsycINFO, and International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS]). The key words included: “neonatal mortality,” “antenatal care,” and “Southern Asia.” Nonrandomized comparative studies conducted in Southern Asia reporting on neonatal mortality in women who received antenatal care compared with those who did not were included. Two authors carried out the screening and data extraction. The Risk of Bias Assessment tool for Non-randomized Studies (RoBANS) was used to assess quality of studies. Results were reported using a random-effects model based on odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.RESULTSFour studies were included in a meta-analysis of adjusted results. The pooled odds ratio was 0.46 (95% confidence interval, 0.24 to 0.86) for neonatal deaths among women having at least 1 antenatal care visit during pregnancy compared with women having none. In the final meta-analysis, 16 studies could not be included because of lack of adjustment for confounders, highlighting the need for further higher-quality studies to evaluate the true impact.CONCLUSIONThis review suggests that in Southern Asia, neonates born to women who received antenatal care have a lower risk of death in the neonatal period compared with neonates born to women who did not receive antenatal care. This should encourage health policy to strengthen antenatal care programs in Southern Asia.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsantenatal carematernal health servicesneonatal deathneonatal mortalityprenatal careSouthern AsiaRecommended articlesCited by (0)A.F. and A.M. are joint senior authors.The authors report no conflict of interest.G.L.C. was supported by the University of Bristol and UK Medical Research Council (MRC) (MC_UU_00011/6) and the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program (grant number 733206 LifeCycle).
