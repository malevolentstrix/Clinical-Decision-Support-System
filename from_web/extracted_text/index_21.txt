Check out Abstract Fetal echocardiography facilitates the prenatal diagnosis of infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) and through sequential examinations, allows assessment of fetal hemodynamics and cardiovascular status from the time of diagnosis to delivery. Fetal cardiologists have created diagnostic protocols aimed at risk stratifying severity and potential postnatal compromise in fetuses with CHD, and identifying those who may require special intervention at birth or within the first days of life. In this article, we review fetal cardiovascular physiology, the progression of CHD in utero and fetal echocardiographic findings used for risk stratification of newborns with CHD, as well as some of the basic principles of planning for the neonatal resuscitation and initial transitional care of these complex newborns.
