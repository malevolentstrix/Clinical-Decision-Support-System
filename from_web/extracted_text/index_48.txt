Previously it has beenshown that pregnancies affected by hyperemesis gravidarum in the mother are at higher risk of having low birthweight offspring. In this study we tested whether such risks are also evident with less severe nausea and vomitingin pregnancy.Methods: One thousand two hundred thirty-eight women in the prospective Cambridge Baby Growth Study filledin pregnancy questionnaires which included questions relating to adverse effects of pregnancy and drugs takenduring that time. Ordinal logistic regression models, adjusted for parity, ethnicity, marital and smoking status wereused to relate the risk of giving birth to low birth weight (< 2.5 kg) babies to nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancythat were not treated with anti-emetics and did not report suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.Results: Only three women in the cohort reported having had hyperemesis gravidarum although a further 17women reported taking anti-emetics during pregnancy. Of those 1218 women who did not take anti-emetics 286(23.5%) did not experience nausea or vomiting, 467 (38.3%) experienced nausea but not vomiting and 465experienced vomiting (38.2%). Vomiting during pregnancy was associated with higher risk of having a low birthweight baby (odds ratio 3.5 (1.2, 10.8), p= 0.03). The risk associated with vomiting was found in the first (p= 0.01)and second (p = 0.01) trimesters but not the third (p= 1.0). The higher risk was not evident in those women whoonly experienced nausea (odds ratio 1.0 (0.3, 4.0), p = 1.0).Conclusions: Vomiting in early pregnancy, even when not perceived to be sufficiently severe to merit treatment, isassociated with a higher risk of delivering a low birth weight baby. Early pregnancy vomiting might therefore beusable as a marker of higher risk of low birth weight in pregnancy. This may be of benefit in situations whereroutine ultrasound is not available to distinguish prematurity from fetal growth restriction, so low birth weight isused as an alternative.Keywords: Hyperemesis gravidarum, Nausea, Anti-emetic, Small for gestational ageBackgroundLow birth weight (LBW) leads to a higher risk of peri-natal mortality and morbidity, including impairedgrowth and cognitive development [1]. More long-termcomplications include higher risks for high blood pres-sure [2] and cardiovascular disease [3], impaired glucosetolerance and type 2 diabetes [4], early age at menarche[5] and menopause [6], and reduced bone mineral dens-ity [7] and osteoporosis [8]. LBW can relate to one orboth of premature birth and fetal growth restriction, orbeing constitutionally small, and risk of LBW can be re-lated to such factors as ethnic differences, multiple birthpregnancies, maternal age at birth, fetal environmentalfactors such as exposure to alcohol, smoking or illicitdrugs, maternal nutrition during pregnancy, poor socio-economic status [9] and genetic defects [10]. Another riskfactor appears to be hyperemesis gravidarum [11–13], asevere form of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy that can* Correspondence: cjp1002@cam.ac.uk1Department of Paediatrics, University of Cambridge, Box 116, CambridgeBiomedical Campus, Hills Road, Cambridge CB2 0QQ, UKFull list of author information is available at the end of the article© The Author(s). 2018 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link tothe Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

Treatmentof severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy with anti-emetics may even be associated with a reduction in theprevalence of LBW [14,15], although such findings are byno means universal [16–18].Whilst the association between hyperemesis gravi-darum and higher risk of LBW is reasonably well estab-lished, what is not so clear is whether potentially lesssevere nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy is also asso-ciated with the risk of delivering LBW babies. The onlyrecent related evidence suggests that it may be associ-ated with being small for gestational age (SGA) due tofetal growth restriction, one of the main reasons for ababy having a LBW [19]. This study was therefore de-signed to test the hypothesis that nausea and vomitingin pregnancy, of insufficient severity to require treat-ment, is associated with the risk of delivering a LBWbaby. To do this we used data collected for the Cam-bridge Baby Growth Study.MethodsCohortThe prospective and longitudinal Cambridge BabyGrowth Study recruited 2229 mothers (and their part-ners and offspring) attending ultrasound clinics duringearly pregnancy at the Rosie Maternity Hospital,Cambridge, United Kingdom, between 2001 and 2009[20]. All mothers were over 16 years of age. Birthweights of their babies, their sex and their gestationalage at birth were extracted from hospital notes, havingbeen recorded there by midwives. LBW was defined as abirth weight of less than 2.5 kg. SGA was classified asbeing in the lowest tenth percentile for gestational age.Prematurity was defined as being born prior to week 37of gestation. Categorisation according to whether or notthe participants developed gestational diabetes [21]orgestational hypertension [22] has been described previ-ously. In this cohort, 96.9% of the offspring were ofwhite ethnicity, 0.8% were of mixed race, 0.6% wereblack (African or Caribbean), 0.8% were East-Asian, and0.9% were Indo-Asian.Each of the study participants was given a printedquestionnaire at recruitment with questions to answerand return once the pregnancy was completed [23].They were encouraged to fill it in as the pregnancy pro-gressed. The questionnaires included boxes to tick if theparticipants had experienced nausea or had vomitedduring pregnancy. If either of these boxes were tickedthere were further boxes to fill in concerning the timing(i.e. week(s) of pregnancy) when the nausea or vomitingwere experienced. A further question asked “Have youtaken any medicine during this pregnancy?”Thosewomen who responded in the affirmative were thenasked to complete a table with the following headings:“Name”,“Disease”,“Daily Dose”,“No. of Days”and“Gestational Week(s)”. This means that nausea andvomiting prior to attending the booking clinic wouldhave had to have been recalled over a maximum periodof several weeks whereas nausea and vomiting subse-quent to that could be recorded as the pregnancy pro-gressed (requiring recollection over a much shorterperiod of time). A total of 1238 women (54.6%) filled inthe questionnaires; those that did not were excludedfrom the present analysis. For 598 of the pregnancieswhere the mother failed to return a filled-in question-naire the baby’s birth weight was also missing. The birthweights of the remaining babies, adjusted for pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, gestational age at birth, parityand sex, were not different between those that com-pleted the questionnaire and those that did not (filled inquestionnaire 3.482 (3.456, 3.508) kg v. did not fill inquestionnaire 3.403 (3.310, 3.497) kg, p= 0.1), althoughthe prevalence of LBW in the offspring of the womenthat returned the questionnaires was lower (filled inquestionnaire 37/1218 v. did not fill in questionnaire27/431, p=5×10−3). Of those women that filled intheir questionnaires only 3 reported that they hadhyperemesis gravidarum and a further 17 were treatedwith anti-emetics: cyclizine (7), promethazine (5), pro-chlorperazine (4), metoclopramide (2), domperidone(2), prednisolone (2), chlorphenamine (1), ondanse-tron (1), chlorpromazine (1) and unknown (1). These20 women were excluded from this specific analysisin order to test only those women who had a poten-tially milder phenotype. The self-reported timings ofexposure to nausea and/or vomiting were divided intotrimesters (first trimester being up to gestational week12, second trimester being weeks 13 to 27 and thirdtrimester being from week 28 onwards).Categorisation and calculationsWe categorised each of the women into one of three dif-ferent groups: those who reported neither nausea norvomiting (n= 286), those who reported nausea but notvomiting (n= 467) and those who reported vomiting(n= 465, 432 of whom reported nausea and vomitingand 33 who reported vomiting without nausea). Thosethat reported vomiting without nausea had no evidenceof concurrent urinary or chest infections, or evidence ofthe vomiting occurring just in the final trimester ofpregnancy. The body mass indexes (BMI) were calcu-lated dividing the maternal weights prior to pregnancyby their heights squared.Statistical analysisAssociations with LBW were adjusted for the followingconfounders: parity, marital and smoking statuses, andethnicity [24].

Rights reserved. and quantitative continuous variables (such as BMI andmaternal age) were tested using linear regression models(adjusted for confounders where necessary). Associationswith dichotomous variables (such as LBW) were testedusing ordinal logistic regression (adjusted for confounderswhere necessary), the χ2-test or Fisher’s exact test asappropriate. Unless otherwise stated all other data arepresented as means (95% confidence intervals (CI)).Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 13(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas, U.S.A.). P<0.05was considered statistically significant throughout.ResultsMaternal clinical characteristicsTable 1shows the clinical characteristics of the differentgroups tested. Those 465 women who experiencedvomiting during pregnancy (432 of whom also reportednausea) tended to be younger (p= 1.5 × 10−3) andslightly heavier/more obese (pre-pregnancy weight p= 0.02,pre-pregnancy BMI p= 0.01) than those women who didnot experience nausea or vomiting in pregnancy. These dif-ferences in clinical characteristics from those women whodid not experience nausea or vomiting, were not evident inthose women who experienced nausea but not vomiting.Associations between maternal exposure to nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy and birth characteristics of thebabyThe delivery of LBW babies was more common in thosewomen who experienced vomiting in pregnancy (whenadjusted for confounders) than in those women who didnot experience vomiting or nausea (p= 0.03; Table 2).This relationship was still evident after further adjustmentwas made for maternal BMI prior to pregnancy (OR 3.1(1.0, 9.7), p= 0.048). In contrast there was no higher riskof LBW associated with experiencing nausea but notvomiting in pregnancy (p=1.0).Table 2shows other birth characteristics of women ac-cording to their experience of nausea and vomiting inpregnancy. Despite the differences in risk of LBW, therewas no apparent difference in mean birth weight, gesta-tional age at birth or prevalence of prematurity or SGA.Similarly there was no apparent difference in the birthweight adjusted for pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, gesta-tional age at birth, sex and parity. However there was aslightly higher proportion of female babies born tomothers who experienced vomiting during pregnancy.Figure 1shows Kernel density estimation plots for un-adjusted birth weight, gestational age at birth and birthweight for gestational age according to maternal expos-ure to nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Small differ-ences in the distributions of these were evident in eachplot.Associations between exposure to vomiting in differenttrimesters of pregnancy and birth characteristics of thebabyThe higher prevalence of giving birth to LBW babies inwomen who experienced vomiting was evident in thosewho experienced it in the first (OR 4.3 (1.4, 13.2), p=0.01,n= 266 vomiting and n= 204 no nausea or vomiting) orsecond (OR 4.4 (1.4, 13.9), p = 0.01, n= 185 vomiting andn = 204 no nausea or vomiting) trimester of pregnancy.However it was not evident in those who experienced it inthe third trimester (OR 1.0 (1.0, 1.0), n=36 vomiting and204 no nausea or vomiting, p=1.0).Table 1 Characteristics of the pregnant women in the Cambridge Baby Growth Study who returned their questionnairescategorised according to whether or not they experienced nausea or vomiting in pregnancyCharacteristic No Nausea or Vomiting Nausea alone Vomitingn 286 467 465Age (years) 34.2(33.7, 34.6)33.6(33.4, 33.9)33.1***(32.7, 33.4)Height (m) 166.1(165.3, 166.8)165.9(165.5, 166.3)165.7(165.1, 166.4)Pre-pregnancy weight (kg) 65.0(63.6, 66.4)66.1(65.3, 66.9)67.1*(66.0, 68.3)Pre-pregnancy BMI (kg/m2) 23.6(23.1, 24.1)24.0(23.7, 24.3)24.5*(24.0, 24.9)Weight gain during pregnancy (kg) 7.9(7.1, 8.7)8.2(7.7, 8.6)8.4(7.7, 9.1)Smoked during pregnancy (%) 4.2 1.9 4.6Developed gestational diabetes (%) 10.6 9.6 9.6Developed gestational hypertension (%) 6.9 4.2 7.2*P < 0.05, **P< 0.01, ***P< 0.001 compared with the no nausea or vomiting group.

DiscussionVomiting in pregnancy, not treated with anti-emetics, isassociated with a higher risk of giving birth to LBW ba-bies in this study. This is consistent with reported asso-ciations between LBW (or related phenotypes such asSGA) and hyperemesis gravidarum [11–13,25–28], al-though such associations are not universal findings[29–32]. Nausea and vomiting with no reference tohyperemesis gravidarum has also been associated witha higher risk of LBW [33] and decreased birth weight[34] in some other studies, although no difference inrisk was reported in others [19,35–37]. Although asystematic review [38] reported a lower risk of LBWin association with nausea and vomiting in pregnancythe studies that it was based looked at anti-emeticuse to categories study participants [14,15]. This istherefore very different to our own study where wespecifically excluded women who took anti-emetics incase these drugs affected pathways involved in regu-lating LBW risk [39]. Similarly the very large Norwe-gian Mother and Child Cohort Study [40]foundreduced population rates of LBW in association withnausea and vomiting in pregnancy, but did so withoutspecifically excluding those women who took anti-emetics in pregnancy. Our study therefore presentsresults a slightly different population to those exam-ined in other investigations, and one where we specif-ically investigated a potentially milder negative aspectof pregnancy than hyperemesis gravidarum.This higher risk for LBW associated with vomiting,and nausea but just in the second trimester, appeared tobe in the first two trimesters of pregnancy with an ap-parent lack of risk in the third trimester. Studies are on-going to try and discover whether or not nausea andvomiting in pregnancy and resulting associations aregenetically mediated [41,42]. With an overall odds ratioof 3.5 for LBW in our population, vomiting in earlypregnancy may be a marker of risk for LBW that is use-ful for its prediction in conjunction with other risk fac-tors. Where routine ultrasound is available small babiestend to be assessed as either SGA (possibly due to fetalgrowth restriction) and/or premature rather than LBW,but the link with vomiting may be useful in areas wheresuch scans are not available and LBW is used toTable 2 Birth related factors of babies of women in the Cambridge Baby Growth Study who returned their questionnaires,categorised according to whether they experienced nausea or vomiting in pregnancyBirth-related Factor No Nausea or Vomiting Nausea alone Vomitingn 286 467 465Parity (n) 1.7(1.6-1.8)1.8(1.7-1.8)1.8*(1.8-1.9)Birth weight (kg) 3.512(3.459, 3.565)3.504(3.474, 3.534)3.496(3.453, 3.540)Adjusted birth weight (kg) 3.494(3.449, 3.539)3.499(3.474, 3.525)3.505(3.468, 3.541)LBW (n/total (%)) 6/277(2.2%)9/461(2.0%)21/460*(4.6%)LBW (OR) Ref. 1.0(0.3-4.0)3.5*(1.2-10.8)LBW (OR) first trimester nausea or vomiting 2.1(0.8-5.7)4.3*(1.4-13.2)LBW (OR) second trimester nausea or vomiting 4.2*(1.7-10.1)4.4*(1.4-13.9)LBW (OR) third trimester nausea or vomiting 1.5(0.3-6.7)0.8(0.1-7.0)Gestational age at birth (weeks) 39.9(39.8, 40.1)39.9(39.8, 40.0)39.8(39.7, 39.9)Prematurity(n (%))4(1.4)7(1.5)11(2.3)SGA(n (%))11(3.9)16(3.5)25(5.2)Sex of the baby(n (%) male)161(56.9%)236(51.1%)225(49.9%)**P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001 compared with the no nausea or vom iting group.

Nausea and vomiting in preg-nancy are thought to be protective towards the embryo/fetus in terms of reducing exposure to food borne harm-ful substances such as infective microorganisms [43],and they can lead to changes in the maternal dietary in-take [44]. There is evidence that this can lead to positiveeffects on the fetus such as decreased rates of miscar-riage and congenital malformations [45]. Whilst poten-tially being an advantage in a mild form, in excess it ispossible that this vomiting might reduce nutrient deliv-ery to the fetus leading to the greater risk of LBW [46].The fact that in our population as a whole there was noapparent decrease in mean birth weight despite thehigher prevalence of LBW suggests that whilst there is anegative impact of vomiting on birth weight for somebabies, in other babies a protective advantage may beevident [43]. The Kernel density estimation plot for birthweight in our population (Fig. 1(a)) would appear to beconsistent with this suggestion (as birth weight densityaround the mean appeared to be higher in those womenaffected by vomiting).LBW often relates to the baby undergoing fetal growthrestriction and/or being born prematurely. Given the in-crease in birth weight usually observed in male babies,in general there is also a slightly increased risk of LBWin female babies compared to males [9]. In our popula-tion despite the association between vomiting and LBW,we did not find further significant independent associa-tions between exposure to vomiting in pregnancy andthe prevalence of SGA (a group that may have beenenriched with babies who underwent fetal growth re-striction) or premature births or the gestational age atbirth. Looking at the Kernel density estimation plots forbirth weight in our population below the cut off forLBW the line for women who experienced vomiting wasclearly a little higher than those representing the othergroups (Fig. 1(a)). The differences between the groupsbelow the cut offs in the gestational ages at birth (to as-sess the densities related to prematurity) and the birthweights for gestational age (to assess the densities re-lated to SGA) plots were smaller though (Fig. 1(b) and(c)). Further studies are required to validate these find-ings in other cohorts, especially those that are betterable to distinguish whether the LBW relates more toSGA (and therefore probably fetal growth restriction),prematurity or a mix of the two.Whilst we could not ascribe the increased risk of LBW tofetal growth restriction or premature birth we did note aslight excess of pregnant women carrying female babies.This excess has previously been observed with hyperemesisgravidarum [47]. We recently reported that serum GDF-15concentrations around week 15 of pregnancy were higherin those women reporting vomiting in the second trimesterof pregnancy in the Cambridge Baby Growth Study [48], ahormone that may stimulate vomiting in pregnancy [49].Interestingly we have also observed an increased concentra-tion of week 15 serum GDF-15 concentrations in womencarrying females compared to those carrying males in ourpopulation (Petry et al., unpublished observation), whichmay explain the slight excess of pregnant women carryingfemales in the group that experienced vomiting.The main strengths of this study are its prospective na-ture and the fact that its design enabled us to study a groupof women with a potentially milder, albeit still unpleasantphenotype than has been tested in other published studies.We have therefore uniquely been able to observe that therisk of giving birth to a LBW baby is higher with vomiting.The study’s main limitation is that the nausea and vomitingand the taking of any anti-emetics to treat it were self-reported. The analysis could therefore have been affectedby recall bias [50], although given that the women were en-couraged to fill in their questionnaires as their pregnanciesprogressed rather than retrospectively the effects of thismay have been limited. Indeed effects of any recall biaswere clearly not sufficient to prevent us from discoveringour association between increased circulating GDF-15 con-centrations and second trimester vomiting [48]. Anotherlimitation of our study may be a slight lack of statisticalpower to investigate potential effects of confounders.How-ever there was clearly sufficient power in our study to testassociations between the maternal experience of nauseaand vomiting in pregnancy and the risk of delivering LBWbabies. The final main limitation may be exclusion ofwomen who took anti-emetics during pregnancy. This isbecause the threshold for nausea and vomiting wherewomen sought and were then prescribed anti-emeticswouldhavevariedfromparticipanttoparticipant,andtherefore the exclusion could have been rather self-selecting. However the advantage of doing this is the lackof potential confounding in our study of these drugs affect-ing pathways involved in regulating fetal growth, a strengthof the study.(See figure on previous page.)Fig. 1 Kernel density estimation plots of aunadjusted birth weight distributions, bgestational age at birth and cbirth weight adjusted forgestational age at birth percentiles in the Cambridge Baby Growth Study in babies whose mothers were not treated with anti-emetics in pregnancy.The lines are plotted according to the mother’s exposure to nausea or vomiting in pregnancy.

ConclusionsThis study suggests that vomiting in early pregnancyof insufficient severity to merit self-selected treatmentwith anti-emetics is associated with a higher risk of awoman giving birth to a LBW baby. It is possible thatthis vomiting may therefore be a marker of LBWpregnancies. This could be useful in situations whereroutine ultrasound is not available to distinguish pre-maturity from being SGA, so LBW is used as an al-ternative to encompass them both.Additional fileAdditional file 1: Description of data: the data that was associated withthe manuscript entitled “Vomiting in pregnancy is associated with ahigher risk of low birth weight: a cohort study”by Petry et al.

Some studies have shown that NVP is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as increased risk of preterm birth (PTB) [8][9][10][11], low birth weight (LBW) [8,9,[11][12][13][14], and neural tube defects [15,16]. While, some studies suggested that NVP has protective effects on pregnancy outcomes, such as lower risk of PTB [13,17,18], LBW [19], small for gestational age (SGA) [19], and pregnancy loss [20][21][22]. ...... Whereas our results were inconsistent with the findings of two recent China studies, one showed that vomiting in the first trimester increased the risk for PTB [10], another observed that male infants born to women with NVP at the first trimester and no NVP at the second trimester were more likely to have LBW [12]. Besides, some studies reported an association between NVP and increased risk of PTB [9,11], or LBW [9,11,14]. However, other studies reported lower risk of PTB [17,18], or LBW [19] in pregnant women who experienced NVP. ...... Some studies classified NVP into three categories: no NVP, nausea only, and nausea/vomiting [19,32]. Some studies classified NVP into two categories: no NVP, and NVP [11,13], or no NVP, and vomiting only [10,14]. Some studies evaluated the effects of NVP exposure throughout the pregnancy [9,11,19], others only assessed the effects of NVP in the first trimester [10,14,17], and still others analyzed effects of NVP in the first, second, and third trimesters [13,14], respectively. ...Evaluation of nausea and vomiting in the first trimester on the risk of adverse birth outcomes and the contribution of genetic polymorphisms: a pilot prospective studyArticleFull-text availableNov 2022ARCH GYNECOL OBSTET Nana LiZhiwei XueHongmei XuShu ZhouPurposeTo evaluate the impact of Nausea and Vomiting in Pregnancy (NVP) on the risk of Preterm Birth (PTB) and Low Birth Weight (LBW), and explore the effect of genetic polymorphisms on the severity of NVP.MethodsA prospective study was conducted. Participants’ experience of NVP prior to 12 gestational weeks were evaluated by a Pregnancy-Unique Quantification of Emesis and Nausea (PUQE) scale. 11 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) loci located in growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) and leucine-rich repeat containing 25 (LRRC25) gene of chr19p13.11 and intergenic region of chr4q12 were genotyped, which were implicated as genetic risk factors for NVP. Logistic regression models were applied to determine the effect of NVP in the first trimester on the risk of PTB and LBW, and genetic polymorphisms on the risk of NVP.ResultsAmong 413 pregnant women, the incidence of nausea and vomiting was 85.5% (n = 353) in the first trimester, including 38.7% (n = 160) mild vomiting, 42.6% (n = 176) moderate vomiting and 4.1% (n = 17) severe vomiting. 33 were PTB, 20 were LBW.

Emesis gravidarum occur almost happened to 35-91% on pregnancy and about 0.3-3.6% of them have more severe condition, called hyperemesis gravidarum [6][7][8]. Almost 32.7% pregnant women have nausea without vomiting and about 23.5% pregnant women with emesis gravidarum experiences this complaints untul third trimester of pregnancy [8]. Prevalence of emesis gravidarum is 63.5% in first timester, 33.8% in second trimester and 26.2% in third trimester of pregnancy [2,3,9]. ...... Etiology of emesis gravidarum in not known for certain, but several studies have stated that this condition is due to multifactorial factors such as social enviroment, endocrin changes during pregnancy, digestive system disorders, hyperthyroidism, and psychosocial factors [2,4,5,8,[10][11][12]. Other research have shown that there is relationship between risk factors with emesis gravidarum such as maternal age, parity, employment status, smoking, vitamin consumption and educational level [6,7,9,[13][14][15]. ...... Some opinions state that HCG stimulates process of excretion of gastrointestinal [11]. This condition can cause hyperthyroxinemia by showing symptoms of tachycardia, tremors, increased systolic, hyperreflexes, palpitations, depression and anxiety [7,13]. ...Relationship Between Beta HCG Hormone Levels, Anxiety and Stress With Severe Degrees of Emesis GravidarumArticleFull-text availableMar 2022Dewi Novitasari Suhaid Deni SunjayaVita Murniati T LubisIndun L SetyonoEmesis gravidarum is a common complaint of nausea and vomitting that felt by almost 90% of pregnant women. Emesis gravidarum, or better known as morning sickness, offen occur on first trimester of pregnancy. It bring on decrease quality of life pregnant women. It effects to physical and psychological health in pregnancy, family and social life, also their occupation. Etiology of emesis gravidarum is multifactors. This research aim is to analyze relationship between Beta HCG hormone level, anxiety and stress with severe degrees of emesis gravidarum on first trimester of pregnancy. Research used case control studied on 44 pregnant women on first trimester of pregnancy, each group was paired according to their gestational age. Research result show that there is a significant relationship between Beta HCG hormone level (p<0.001; OR 63.3; 95% CI 9.509-421.822) and anxiety (p<0.05; OR 4.9; 95% CI 1.325-18.205) with severe degrees of emesis gravidarum. Characteristic and demographics not entirely related to emesis gravidarum. Conclusion of this research is psychological and hormonal factors are related to severe degrees of emesis gravidarum.

One cohort study showed that vomiting during the early trimester of pregnancy was associated with a higher risk of low birth weight [12]. In developing countries, maternal age, illiteracy, antenatal care follow-up, body mass index and socioeconomic status were predictors of low birth weight [13]. ...Socio-economic and cultural determinants of mothers and fathers for low birth weight newborns in the region of Marrakech (Morocco): A case-control studyArticleFull-text availableJun 2022PLOS ONE Mohamed Elaabsi Mohamed Loukid Saloua LamtaliBackground: Low birth weight (LBW) is defined as a birth weight less than 2500 g. It is an important predictor of early neonatal mortality, morbidity, and long-term health outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for low birth weight in Marrakech Morocco. Methods: A retrospective based case-control study was conducted from July 2018 to July 2019. 462 mother infant pairs (231 low birth weight babies as cases and 231 normal birth weights as controls) were included in the study. Data were collected through face to face interview using a structured and pretested questionnaire. The collected data were managed with Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression were used to identify factors associated with low birth weight at p-value < 0.05 with their respective odds ratios and 95% confidence interval. Results: The univariate analysis revealed the effect of the following determinants on the LBW: rural residence, father's age, father's professional activity, consanguinity, family type, mother's low educational level, and mother's intense physical activity. After the multivariate analysis, the risk factors identified were: rural residence (P = 0.017), father's professional activity (temporarily working) (P = 0.000), absence of the consanguinity link (P = 0.016), and mother's intense physical activity (P = 0.014). Conclusion: Results show father's professional activity (temporarily working), rural residence, absence of the consanguinity link and mother's intense physical activity are independent predictors of low birth weight. The current findings add substantially to the growing literature on the influence of parent's socio-demographic and cultural factors on LBW in resource-constrained settings and provide empirical data for public health interventions to reduce low birth weight.ViewShow abstract... In addition, this study showed that LBW was significantly associated with hyperemesis gravidrum during current pregnancy. The odds of LBW was high among mother with hyperemesis during the current pregnancy.This is consistent with a systematic review conducted in the Netherlands [29], United Kingdom, and Cambridge University [30]. These could be due to the fact excessive vomiting during pregnancy often leads to low maternal weight gain, poor food intake due to prolonged nausea throughout pregnancy, and overall lower nutritional intake during the pregnancy which can lead to low birth weight. ...Magnitude of Low Birth Weight and Associated Factors among Women who gave Birth in Public Hospitals of Harari Regional State, Eastern EthiopiaArticleFull-text availableJul 2021 Mohammed Abdo Komicha Gudina Atomsa Meyrema AbdoRobaBackground: Low birth weight remains a public health challenge in developing worlds. Globally, low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of early neonatal mortality and morbidity. The primary causes of low birth weight are related to maternal risk factors. For instance; maternal under nutrition, maternal anemia, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are associated with low birth weight. Although it remains one of the top challenges of adverse birth outcome, predictors of low birth weight are rarely Eastern studied in Ethiopia. To the best knowledge of the researchers, the magnitude of low birth weight is not studied in this study area. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the magnitude of low birth weight and associated factors among women who gave birth in public Hospitals of Harari Regional state, Eastern Ethiopia.ViewShow abstractThe perinatal outcomes by gestational weight gain range at 30 weeks of gestation among pre‐pregnancy underweight womenArticleNov 2022J OBSTET GYNAECOL RETakeshi Nagao Sho FukuiSachiko Ohde Michiko YamanakaAims: To evaluate the perinatal outcomes by gestational weight gain (GWG) range at 30 weeks of gestation among underweight pregnant women (pre-pregnancy body mass index ≤ 18.5 kg/m2 ) in Japan. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at a hospital in Japan from 2003 to 2020. The underweight pregnant women (UPW; n = 3643) were divided into quartile groups based on the weight gain at 30 weeks of gestation: group Q1 ≤ 5.7 kg, 5.7 kg < Q2 ≤ 7.2 kg, 7.2 kg < Q3 ≤ 8.8 kg, and 8.8 kg < Q4. Clinical characteristics and outcomes were compared using the t-test, chi-square test, and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The cumulative incidences of preterm births were 7.5% (n = 70), 5.0% (n = 45), 5.4% (n = 50), and 4.9% (n = 44), and the birth rates of small for gestational age (SGA) infants were 15.7% (n = 147), 9.6% (n = 87), 6.9% (n = 64), and 5.9% (n = 53) in Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively. Multivariable analysis revealed that Q1 was significantly associated with preterm births (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0-2.3), and Q1 and Q2 were significantly associated with SGA (adj. OR = 3.0; 95% CI = 2.2-4.3; adj. OR = 1.7; 95% CI = 1.2-2.5, respectively). None of the quartile groups were significantly associated with the incidence of primary cesarean sections, gestational diabetes mellitus, and macrosomia. Conclusions: In UPW, GWG at 30 weeks of ≤5.7 kg and ≤7.2 kg are associated with preterm birth and SGA rates, respectively.ViewShow abstractTrajectory Patterns of Gestational Weight GainArticleOct 2022 Fernanda Manera Renata Cordeiro Fernandes Doroteia Aparecida HöfelmannObjective: To identify gestational weight gain trajectories and their association with demographic, obstetric, and anthropometric characteristics. Method: Information of 599 pregnant women undergoing prenatal care in public health units was collected through questionnaires and medical records, resulting in 4,272 measures of body weight. Group-based trajectory models were applied to identify patterns of gestational weight gain. Results: The average gestational weight gain at 40 weeks was 14.1 kg (95%CI: 13.2, 15.0). Three different trajectory groups were identified: low (9.9%), intermediate (66.4%), and high (23.7%). Pregnant women who smoked and those classified above IOM's weight gain recommendations were more likely to be classified in the group with a high weight gain trajectory; while those with pre-pregnancy overweight or obesity, and with greater parity were more likely to be categorized in the low weight gain trajectory. After adjusting for other variables in the model, parity remained significantly associated with gestational weight gain (β: 0.88; 95%CI: 0.27, 0.73). In the multilevel model, weight gain remained different among the categories of group-based trajectory, even after adjustment for other investigated variables for intermediate (β: 2.94; 95%CI: 2.32, 3.58) and high (β: 5.88; 95%CI: 5.09, 6.66) gestational weight gain trajectory groups. Conclusions: Behavioral, obstetric, and anthropometric characteristics determined the belonging to groups with a high or low trajectory of gestational weight gain. The findings contribute to a better understanding of patterns of gestational weight gain in middle-income women groups.ViewShow abstractIntroduction Patients and Methods S-24 Hyperemesis gravidarum and risks of placental dysfunction disordersArticleFull-text availableFeb 2022J Pakistan Med Assoc Alaa Ibrahim Ali Wassan Nori Bahaa Aldeen AbdulRahman HadiHyperemesis gravidarum (HG), defined as intractable and excessive vomiting during pregnancy, leads to fluid, electrolyte imbalance, nutrition deficiency, acid-base imbalance, weight loss, and need for hospitalization. 1 It is one of the commonest reasons for admission to the hospital; pregnancy nausea, and vomiting occurs in about 85% pregnant women. In contrast to the severe uncontrollable form, 0.3-3% necessitating hospitalisation and adequate rehydration. 2 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) created essential criteria for diagnosing HG includes; hospitalisation, losing weight greater than 5%, and dehydration. 3 HG is most prevalent during the first trimester of pregnancy, typically between 4-10 weeks of gestation and resolves by 20-weeks gestation. 4 There is a diversity in the incidence and reported symptoms severity attributed to a lack of globally accepted definitions, ranging from mild dizziness and dry retching to intractable vomiting. 3,4 Unfortunately, in 10% of affected women the symptoms continue throughout pregnancy 5 thereby increasing foetal and maternal morbidity, as nutritional deficiencies, Wernicke's encephalopathy, placental abruption, and preeclampsia. Foetal complications are common; small for gestational age (SGA), prematurity and early neonatal morbidities. Studies addressing pregnancy complications and neonatal outcome for affected women are conflicting, although previous studies denied the correlation between HG and intrapartum complications such as preeclampsia, Diabetes Mellitus and hypertension. Current evidence suggested the opposite. Earlier detection is vital for reducing foetal and maternal morbidity. 6,7 Proposed theories for HG are many; immunological factors, genetic factors, and psychological factors. Evidence has supported HG's higher risk in hydatidiform mole, multiple pregnancies implying its association to the highest pregnancy hormone levels, specially human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), progesterone and oestrogen. 8 Defective placentation was accredited for increased number of pregnancy complications and was linked to HG pathophysiology.

Abstract Objective: To investigate the association between hospitalisation of cases affected during the first and second trimester of pregnancy with the increased intrapartum complication attributed to placental dysfunction disorders. Additionally to highlight the distinct maternal factors and foetal morbidity patterns for improving the obstetrical outcome. Methods: An observational study was carried out in Al-Yarmouk Hospital, Baghdad, Iraq from the 1st December 2019 to end December, 2020, recruiting 250 singleton pregnancy of gestational age >10 to >21 completed weeks until delivery. Patients were grouped into two; taking gestational age on admission as a divider; group1 < 10 weeks and group 2 > 12 weeks till completed 21weeks.

Results: None of the demographic criteria nor maternal morbidity factors were significant on analyses. Conversely, all intrapartum complications were significantly higher in both recruited groups. Conclusion: The strong relationship between hyperemesis gravidarum and placental dysfunction related complications highlight admitted HG cases as a higher risk group; being liable for severe foetomaternal morbidities, demanding more surveillance for a better outcome.ViewShow abstractIntroduction Patients and Methods S-24 Hyperemesis gravidarum and risks of placental dysfunction disordersArticleFull-text availableDec 2021J Pakistan Med Assoc Bahaa Aldeen AbdulRahman HadiHyperemesis gravidarum (HG), defined as intractable and excessive vomiting during pregnancy, leads to fluid, electrolyte imbalance, nutrition deficiency, acid-base imbalance, weight loss, and need for hospitalization. 1 It is one of the commonest reasons for admission to the hospital; pregnancy nausea, and vomiting occurs in about 85% pregnant women.

OngKeith Burling Stephen o'RahillyNausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) affects 70-90% of all pregnant women but its pathogenesis is unknown. Growth and Differentiation Factor 15 (GDF15), secreted from the trophoblast and decidual stromal cells, is present at high levels in the blood of pregnant women. The receptor for GDF15 has recently been identified and is specifically expressed in the hindbrain where it transmits aversive signals including nausea and conditioned taste aversion. We explored the relationship between GDF15 concentrations in maternal serum during pregnancy and self-reported NVP. In a study of 791 women from the Cambridge Baby Growth Study maternal GDF15 concentrations were higher in women who reported vomiting in the 2 nd trimester (geometric mean: 11,670 pg/mL; 95% confidence interval: 11,056-12,318) and were even higher in the eleven women who reported taking anti-emetics during pregnancy (13,376 (10,821-16,535) compared to those who reported no nausea or vomiting during pregnancy (10,657 (10,121-11,222); P=0.02 and P=0.04, respectively, adjusted for gestational age at sampling and maternal BMI). In conclusion serum GDF15 concentrations early in the second trimester of pregnancy are significantly and positively associated with second trimester vomiting and with maternal anti-emetic use. In the context of the recently revealed biology of GDF15 this data suggests that antagonism of GDF15 may have some potential for therapeutic benefit in NVP.ViewShow abstractPlacenta and appetite genes GDF15 and IGFBP7 are associated with hyperemesis gravidarumArticleFull-text availableDec 2018 Marlena Schoenberg FejzoOlga V. SazonovaJ. Fah SathirapongsasutiCatherine H. WilsonHyperemesis gravidarum (HG), severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, occurs in 0.3-2% of pregnancies and is associated with maternal and fetal morbidity. The cause of HG remains unknown, but familial aggregation and results of twin studies suggest that understanding the genetic contribution is essential for comprehending the disease etiology. Here, we conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for binary (HG) and ordinal (severity of nausea and vomiting) phenotypes of pregnancy complications. Two loci, chr19p13.11 and chr4q12, are genome-wide significant (p < 5 × 10⁻⁸) in both association scans and are replicated in an independent cohort. The genes implicated at these two loci are GDF15 and IGFBP7 respectively, both known to be involved in placentation, appetite, and cachexia. While proving the casual roles of GDF15 and IGFBP7 in nausea and vomiting of pregnancy requires further study, this GWAS provides insights into the genetic risk factors contributing to the disease.ViewShow abstractNausea and vomiting in early pregnancy: Effects on food intake and diet qualityArticleFull-text availableNov 2016MATERN CHILD NUTR Sarah CrozierHazel InskipKeith M. Godfrey Sian M RobinsonExperiences of nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) vary greatly, but the paucity of studies with pre-pregnancy dietary data mean that little is known about the effects of NVP on diet. Using an administered food frequency questionnaire, diet was assessed before pregnancy and at 11 and 34 weeks’ gestation in 2270 participants in a UK birth cohort study (Southampton Women’s Survey). Experience of NVP in early pregnancy was graded as none, mild, moderate or severe. Participants reported their level of food consumption as more, the same or less than before pregnancy. ‘Prudent’ diet scores (derived using principal component analysis) were used to describe participants’ diet quality before, in early and late pregnancy. In early pregnancy, 89% of women were nauseous, although most commonly the NVP experienced was mild (48%) or moderate (30%); 11% had severe NVP. 39% of women reported an increase in their level of food intake in early pregnancy; 34% reported a reduction. Increasing severity of nausea was associated with changes in intake of a range of foods, most notably reduced consumption of vegetables, tea/coffee, rice/pasta, breakfast cereals, beans/pulses and citrus fruits/fruit juices and increased consumption of white bread, and soft drinks. Increasing severity of nausea was also associated with decreasing prudent diet score from before to early pregnancy, such that women with severe nausea had prudent diet scores 0.29 SDs lower than those with no nausea (P<0.001). However, this was transient as NVP was not related to change in diet quality from before to late pregnancy.<br/ViewShow abstractPrenatal paracetamol exposure is associated with shorter anogenital distance in male infantsArticleFull-text availableSep 2016B.G. Fisher Ajay Thankamony Ieuan A Hughes Carlo L AceriniStudy question What is the relationship between maternal paracetamol intake during the masculinisation programming window (MPW, 8–14 weeks of gestation) and male infant anogenital distance (AGD), a biomarker for androgen action during the MPW? Summary answer Intrauterine paracetamol exposure during 8–14 weeks of gestation is associated with shorter AGD from birth to 24 months of age. What is already known The increasing prevalence of male reproductive disorders may reflect environmental influences on foetal testicular development during the MPW. Animal and human xenograft studies have demonstrated that paracetamol reduces foetal testicular testosterone production, consistent with reported epidemiological associations between prenatal paracetamol exposure and cryptorchidism. Study design, size, duration Prospective cohort study (Cambridge Baby Growth Study), with recruitment of pregnant women at ~12 post-menstrual weeks of gestation from a single UK maternity unit between 2001 and 2009, and 24 months of infant follow-up. Of 2229 recruited women, 1640 continued with the infancy study after delivery, of whom 676 delivered male infants and completed a medicine consumption questionnaire. Participants/materials, setting, method Mothers self-reported medicine consumption during pregnancy by a questionnaire administered during the perinatal period. Infant AGD (measured from 2006 onwards), penile length and testicular descent were assessed at 0, 3, 12, 18 and 24 months of age, and age-specific Z scores were calculated. Associations between paracetamol intake during three gestational periods (<8 weeks, 8–14 weeks and >14 weeks) and these outcomes were tested by linear mixed models. Two hundred and twenty-five (33%) of six hundred and eighty-one male infants were exposed to paracetamol during pregnancy, of whom sixty-eight were reported to be exposed during 8–14 weeks. AGD measurements were available for 434 male infants. Main results and the role of chance Paracetamol exposure during 8–14 weeks of gestation, but not any other period, was associated with shorter AGD (by 0.27 SD, 95% CI 0.06–0.48, P = 0.014) from birth to 24 months of age. This reduction was independent of body size. Paracetamol exposure was not related to penile length or testicular descent. Limitations, reasons for caution Confounding by other drugs or endocrine-disrupting chemicals cannot be discounted. The cohort was not fully representative of pregnant women in the UK, particularly in terms of maternal ethnicity and smoking prevalence. There is likely to have been misclassification of paracetamol exposure due to recall error. Wider implications of the findings Our observational findings support experimental evidence that intrauterine paracetamol exposure during the MPW may adversely affect male reproductive development.

Previously, we found associations between fetal IGF2 gene variants and maternal glucose concentrations in late pregnancy. Methods: In the present study, we tested associations between SNP alleles from 15 fetal imprinted genes and maternal glucose concentrations in late pregnancy in the Cambridge Baby Growth and Wellbeing cohorts (1160 DNA trios). Results: Four fetal SNP alleles with the strongest univariate associations: paternally-transmitted IGF2 rs10770125 (P-value=2×10(-4)) and INS rs2585 (P-value=7×10(-4)), and maternally-transmitted KCNQ1(OT1) rs231841 (P-value=1×10(-3)) and KCNQ1(OT1) rs7929804 (P-value=4×10(-3)), were used to construct a composite fetal imprinted gene allele score which was associated with maternal glucose concentrations (P-value=4.3×10(-6), n=981, r(2)=2.0%) and GDM prevalence (odds ratio per allele 1.44 (1.15, 1.80), P-value=1×10(-3), n=89 cases and 899 controls). Meta-analysis of the associations including data from 1367 Hyperglycaemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study participants confirmed the paternally-transmitted fetal IGF2/INS SNP associations (rs10770125, P-value=3.2×10(-8), rs2585, P-value=3.6×10(-5)) and the composite fetal imprinted gene allele score association (P-value=1.3×10(-8)), but not the maternally-transmitted fetal KCNQ1(OT1) associations (rs231841, P-value=0.4; rs7929804, P-value=0.2). Conclusion: This study suggests that polymorphic variation in fetal imprinted genes, particularly in the IGF2/INS region, contribute a small but significant part to the risk of raised late pregnancy maternal glucose concentrations.ViewShow abstractOndansetron in Pregnancy and Risk of Adverse Fetal OutcomesArticleJun 2014Obstet Anesth Digest Björn PasternakHenrik Svanström Anders Hviid(N Engl J Med. 2013;368(9):814–823)ViewShow abstractMaternal health in pregnancy and associations with adverse birth outcomes: Evidence from Growing Up in New ZealandArticleOct 2016AUST NZ J OBSTET GYN Amy Bird Cameron Charles GrantDinusha K Bandara Susan MortonObjective: To examine prospectively multiple indicators of pregnancy health and associations with adverse birth outcomes within a large, diverse sample of contemporary women. Design: A cohort of pregnant women who gave birth during 2009-10. Population: We enrolled a sample of 6822 pregnant New Zealand (NZ) women: 11% of all births in NZ during the recruitment period. Methods: We analysed a number of maternal health indicators and behaviours during pregnancy in relation to birth outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. Associations were described using adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Main outcome measures: Three birth outcomes, low birth weight (LBW), pre-term birth (PTB) and delivery type, were measured via linkage with maternity hospital perinatal databases. Small for gestational age (SGA) was then defined as below the 10th percentile by week of gestation. Results: Modelling of birth outcomes after adjusting for confounders indicated patterns of increased risk of LBW and PTB for women who smoke, have elevated pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), or with insufficient pregnancy weight gain. SGA was associated with maternal smoking, alcohol use, insufficient weight gain and nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Risk of caesarean section was associated with having a diagnosed illness before pregnancy, elevated BMI, greater pregnancy weight gain and less pregnancy exercise. Number of risk factor variables were then used to model birth outcomes. Women with multiple risk factors were at increased risk compared with those who had no risk factors. Conclusions: Women with multiple health risks are at particular risk of adverse birth outcomes.ViewShow abstractAssociations Between Fetal Imprinted Genes and Maternal Blood Pressure in PregnancyArticleOct 2016Hypertension Clive PetryNuria Sanz MarcosGracielle Pimentel David B DungerIn addition to maternal genes and environmental exposures, variation in fetal imprinted genes could also affect maternal blood pressure during pregnancy. Our objective was to test the associations between polymorphic variants in 16 imprinted genes and maternal mean arterial blood pressures in 1160 DNA trios from 2 established birth cohorts (the Cambridge Baby Growth and Wellbeing Studies) and seek replication in 1367 Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study participants. Significant univariate associations, all independent of fetal sex, were observed in the Cambridge cohorts, including FAM99A rs1489945 transmitted from the mother (P=2×10(-)(4)), DLK1 rs10139403 (mother; P=9×10(-)(4)), DLK1 rs12147008 (mother; P=1×10(-)(3)), H19 rs217222 (father; P=1×10(-)(3)), SNRPN rs1453556 (father; P=1×10(-)(3)), IGF2 rs6356 (father; P=1×10(-)(3)), and NNAT rs6066671 (father; P=1×10(-)(3)). In meta-analysis including additional independent Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study data, the association with maternally transmitted fetal DLK1 rs10139403 reached genome-wide significance (P=6.3×10(-)(10)). With the exception of fetal rs1489945 and rs217222, all of other associations were unidirectional and most were statistically significant. To further explore the significance of these relationships, we developed an allele score based on the univariate findings. The score was strongly associated with maternal blood pressure at 31 weeks (P=4.1×10(-)(8); adjusted r(2)=5.6%) and 37 weeks of pregnancy (P=1.1×10(-)(4); r(2)=3.6%), and during the last 2 weeks before parturition (P=1.1×10(-)(10); r(2)=8.7%). It was also associated with gestational hypertension (odds ratio, 1.54 [range, 1.14-2.09] per allele; P=0.005; 45 cases and 549 controls). These data support the concept that fetal imprinted genes are related to the development of gestational hypertension.ViewShow abstractCohort Profile: Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy genetics consortium (NVP Genetics Consortium)ArticleFeb 2016INT J EPIDEMIOLLucía Colodro-CondeSimone Cross Penelope LindSarah E.

Methods A single-centre, retrospective cohort study, using electronic databases of patients, with and without hyperemesis gravidarum, undergoing ... [Show full abstract] caesarean section from 2015 to 2019. The incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting were established by a review of the documentation of administration of postoperative anti-emetics within the 24-h period after surgery, and examined using univariable, multivariable binary and ordered logistic regression models. Results Data were compared for 76 patients with hyperemesis gravidarum and 315 patients without the condition. The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting in the hyperemesis group versus the non-hyperemesis group was 43.4% and 29.6%, respectively. The odds of experiencing postoperative nausea and vomiting was 1.95 times higher in women with hyperemesis gravidarum than in those without (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.36, P=0.016). The odds of having more severe postoperative nausea and vomiting were greater in the hyperemesis gravidarum group (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.20, P=0.014). Conclusion Patients with hyperemesis gravidarum are more likely to develop nausea and vomiting after caesarean section, and this is likely to be of greater severity than in those without the condition. This finding should assist the effective provision of intra-operative and postoperative anti-emetics for patients with hyperemesis gravidarum undergoing caesarean section.Read moreArticleFull-text availableVomiting in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of low birth weight: a cohort study.May 2018 Clive PetryKen K. Ong Kathryn Beardsall[...]D. B. DungerBackground: Low birth weight has important short- and long-term health implications. Previously it has been shown that pregnancies affected by hyperemesis gravidarum in the mother are at higher risk of having low birth weight offspring. In this study we tested whether such risks are also evident with less severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Methods: 1,238 women in the prospective Cambridge ... [Show full abstract] Baby Growth Study filled in pregnancy questionnaires which included questions relating to adverse effects of pregnancy and drugs taken during that time. Ordinal logistic regression models, adjusted for parity, ethnicity, marital and smoking status were used to relate the risk of giving birth to low birth weight (< 2.5 kg) babies to nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy that were not treated with anti-emetics and did not report suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. Results: Only 3 women in the cohort reported having had hyperemesis gravidarum although a further 17 women reported taking anti-emetics during pregnancy. Of those 1,218 women who did not take anti-emetics 286 (23.5 %) did not experience nausea or vomiting, 467 (38.3 %) experienced nausea but not vomiting and 465 experienced vomiting (38.2 %). Vomiting during pregnancy was associated with higher risk of having a low birth weight baby (odds ratio 3.5 (1.2, 10.8), p = 0.03). The risk associated with vomiting was found in the first (p = 0.01) and second (p = 0.01) trimesters but not the third (p = 1.0). The higher risk was not evident in those women who only experienced nausea (odds ratio 1.0 (0.3, 4.0), p = 1.0). Conclusions: Vomiting in early pregnancy, even when not perceived to be sufficiently severe to merit treatment, is associated with a higher risk of delivering a low birth weight baby. Early pregnancy vomiting might therefore be usable as a marker of higher risk of low birth weight in pregnancy. This may be of benefit in situations where routine ultrasound is not available to distinguish prematurity from fetal growth restriction, so low birth weight is used as an alternative.View full-textArticleFull-text availablePlacenta-associated adverse pregnancy outcomes in women experiencing mild or severe hyperemesis grav...May 2023 · BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth Tilda Moberg Lennart Walter Van der Veeken Emma Persad[...] Matteo BruschettiniBackground Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) affects 50–80% of pregnant women and is correlated to the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

Method A systematic search in PubMed, Embase and CINAHL Complete was conducted. Studies on pregnant women with nausea in the first or second trimester, reporting either pregnancy outcomes or levels of hCG were included. The primary outcomes were preterm delivery (PTD), preeclampsia, miscarriage, and fetal growth restriction. Risk of bias was assessed using ROBINS-I. The overall certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Results The search resulted in 2023 potentially relevant studies; 23 were included. The evidence was uncertain for all outcomes, however women with HG had a tendency to have an increased risk for preeclampsia [odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% confidence of interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.35], PTD [OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61], small for gestational age (SGA) [OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35], and low birth weight (LBW) [OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.44]. Further, a higher fetal female/male ratio was observed [OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60]. Meta-analyses were not performed for women with NVP; however, most of these studies indicated that women with NVP have a lower risk for PTD and LBW and a higher risk for SGA, and a higher fetal female/male ratio. Conclusion There may be an increased risk in women with HG and a decreased risk in women with NVP for adverse placenta-associated pregnancy outcomes, however the evidence is very uncertain.

The evidence was uncertain for all outcomes, however women with HG had a tendency to have an increased risk for preeclampsia [odds ratio (OR) 1.18, 95% confidence of interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.35], PTD [OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.61], small for gestational age (SGA) [OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.35], and low birth weight (LBW) [OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.26 to 1.44]. Further, a higher foetal female/male ratio was observed [OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.60]. Meta-analyses were not performed for women with NVP; however, most of these studies indicated that women with NVP have a lower risk for PTD and LBW and a higher risk for SGA, and a higher fetal female/male ratio. Conclusion: There may be an increased risk in women with HG and a decreased risk in women with NVP for adverse placenta-associated pregnancy outcomes, however the evidence is very uncertain.

Methods This retrospective study included 233 pregnant women who were diagnosed as hyperemesis gravidarum during first trimester between July 4, 2005 and May 27, 2009 at the Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Simav State Hospital (Simav, ... [Show full abstract] Kütahya, Turkey). The pregnant women were separated into groups according to their metoclopramide or dimenhydrinate use. The pregnant women included in the study were chosen from the pregnant women who were healthy and had singleton pregnancy. Results While 113 pregnant women were treated by metoclopramide and 120 pregnant women by dimenhydrinate. Spontaneous abortion was found as 6.2% in the pregnant women who used metoclopramide and as 4.2% who used dimenhydrinate, and stillbirth rate was 1.8 and 0.8%, respectively. Low birth weight rates were 8.0% in metoclopramide group and 5.8% in dimenhydrinate group, and preterm labor rates were 5.3% and 5.0%, respectively. Conclusion We have found that there was no difference between the pregnant women who used metoclopramide and dimenhydrinate in terms of early period complications and perinatal outcomes.
