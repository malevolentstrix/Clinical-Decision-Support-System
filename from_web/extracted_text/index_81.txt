However, the strength of association, as well as the population impact, between antenatal care and birth weight varied by social group. Prenatal care had the greatest observed impact for socially disadvantaged women, because of their high overall risk of delivery of low-birth weight infants. From these observations, it appears that the efficacy of antenatal services is modified by social situation. As a result, summary evaluations of prenatal care impact may underestimate the true value of these services for certain social groups.Previous article in issueNext article in issueRecommended articlesCited by (0)View full textCopyright © 1983 Published by Mosby, Inc.Recommended articlesNo articles found.Article MetricsView article metricsAbout ScienceDirectRemote accessShopping cartAdvertiseContact and supportTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyWe use cookies to help provide and enhance our service and tailor content and ads.
