We aimed to determine this association in women attending tertiary-care antenatal clinics in Sri Lanka.Material and methodsPresence/absence of AADs in a systematic random sample of 221 antenatal women attending routine antenatal clinics of a teaching hospital who participated in a questionnaire-validation study were confirmed by a psychiatrist. These women were followed up until the end of pregnancy. Information on antenatal comorbidities, adverse pregnancy outcomes was extracted from health records. The association between AADs with antenatal comorbidities and adverse pregnancy outcomes were reported using adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) generated from logistic regression models.ResultsMean (±SD) age of the women was 30 (±5.8) years. AADs were diagnosed in 81 (37%) women. Compared to women without AADs, those who had AADs were more at risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension (OR 6.1; 95% CI 1.2–31.9), gestational diabetes mellitus (OR 12.6; 95% CI 1.5–107.2), preterm labour (OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.4–13.0), prolonged labour (OR 19.0; 95% CI 7.1–51.1), lower segment caesarean section (OR 4.7; 95% CI 2.5–8.7) and low birthweight (OR 11.2; 95% CI 4.8–26.3). All miscarriages, stillbirths and assisted labour occurred exclusively in those with AADs.ConclusionsAADs are strongly associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes. Causal pathways and effect of interventions for AADs must be explored in future research.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsAntenatal anxiety disorderICD-10Pregnancy outcomesSri LankaRecommended articlesCited by (0)1Equal senior authors.© 2023 The Authors.
