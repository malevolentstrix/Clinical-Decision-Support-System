Four sets of PNC guidelines published between 2005 and 2009 were examined and critiqued. The recommendations for assessment procedures, laboratory testing, and education/counseling topics were analyzed within and between these guidelines. The PNC components were synthesized to provide an organized, comprehensive appendix that can guide providers of antepartum care. The appendix may be used to locate which guidelines addressed which topics to assist practitioners to identify evidence sources. The suggested timing for introducing and reinforcing specific topics is also presented in the appendix. Although education is often assumed to be a vital component of PNC, it was inconsistently included in the guidelines that were reviewed. Even when education was included, important detail was lacking. Addressing each woman's needs as the first priority was suggested historically and remains relevant in current practice to systematically provide care while maintaining the woman as the central player. More attention to gaps in current research is important for the development of comprehensive prenatal guidelines that contribute effectively to the long-term health and well-being of women, families, and their communities.IntroductionThere are a variety of published guidelines available for prenatal care (PNC) providers that claim to be evidence-based. Clearly, efforts to practice evidence-based care are encouraged. However, the literature also contains general critiques of evidence-based guidelines, including the following: they outdate quickly with rapidly changing scientific information;1, 2 they are costly to develop;1 they overvalue positivist thinking by reinforcing the value of randomized controlled trials above other methods of knowledge generation;3 they overlook the theoretical portion involved in providers' clinical decision making;3 they can have negative ethical consequences if only research-informed judgments can be supported,3 when confirmatory evidence is missing and incomplete in many areas of health care; and they may not account for individual clients' social needs that outweigh the risk and benefits identified by evidence.4The critical evaluation of the scientific basis for clinical practice is essential to provide effective care. However, unique philosophical approaches fostered by different disciplines can result in alternative provisions of care. This is highlighted when comparing definitions of evidence-based care. Sackett et al.5 proposed the following definition of evidence-based medicine: “Evidence based medicine is the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients. The practice of evidence based medicine means integrating individual clinical expertise with the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.” Alternatively, in the definition of evidence-based nursing practice, the evidence is integrated with the practitioner's expertise and the patient's values and preferences.3PNC guidelines that exclusively examine the scientific evidence without considering the values and preferences of each woman may place the evidence ahead of the needs of the women being served. Kennedy et al.4 recently identified this as a challenge in evidence-based PNC.The purpose of this article is to identify and critique the PNC guidelines published within the past 5 years by five organizational groups. They are, in descending chronologic order of publication, by the US Veterans Health Administration, Department of Veteran Affairs, and Health Affairs, Department of Defence (VA/DoD),6 Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI)7; the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAP/ACOG)8; and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP).9, 10 Key aspects about each of the four guidelines are summarized in Table 1. In addition to critiquing the guidelines, we provide a comprehensive Appendix that includes suggested timing for many topics that were derived from the four guidelines. Educational topics missing in the current guidelines are added as suggestions to facilitate the future provision of comprehensive PNC that includes women's needs and desires.Section snippetsBackgroundThe landmark document, Caring for Our Future: The Content of Prenatal Care,11 was published in 1989 with the goal of establishing evidence for clinical practice and research concerning PNC.12 The recommendations contained were consensus-based and resulted in six themes: (1) early and continuing risk assessment; (2) health promotion, including the preconception visit; (3) medical and psychosocial interventions; (4) standard documentation; (5) expanding objectives to include the health of theWhat Women Want from Prenatal Care and EducationIn an integrative review by Novick,16 women's experiences of PNC were identified across 36 studies. In one of six themes that she derived from the data, Novick described components of PNC that had three subcategories, including “continuity, comprehensiveness, and control.”16 Related to continuity, women preferred a single provider, although they accepted others with previous notification. Regarding comprehensiveness, women valued counseling, education services, and support groups thatThemes in Recent Prenatal Care GuidelinesAs we reviewed the four current prenatal guidelines, six themes found in all four guidelines became apparent: 1) the direction of communication between provider and patient; 2) a predominant focus on the physical versus psychological needs; 3) the increasing attentiveness to risk; 4) additive expectations for PNC; 5) lack of a broad health promotion focus; 6) inconsistent endorsement of component parts of PNC; and 7) lack of attention to PNE. Each theme is explained separately with examplesLimited Evidence for Prenatal EducationThere is a lack of supportive evidence for PNE. In fact, a recent Cochrane review31 concluded that high-quality evidence was lacking for individual or group PNE offered in structured classes for birth and/or parenting. The authors criticized published research for its usual sampling of educated and economically comfortable participants rather than including those who were medically or socially disadvantaged. In addition, the Cochrane authors found that few of the nine studies examined measuredBarriers to Evidence-Based Maternity CareSakala and Corry30 identified another barrier to evidence-based maternity care: the “limitations of views put forth in media and popular discourse.” This point is emphasized in recent data. In the Listening to Mothers II survey,32 women often reported gathering their information from sources such as television shows on birth and key people in their lives, rather than attending formal childbirth education classes. In the first Listening to Mothers survey,33 which was conducted in 2002, 30% ofConclusionsEvidence-based PNC guidelines can be informative; however, they also have limitations. Most significantly, PNE is not well addressed and has been insufficiently studied. We have attempted to acknowledge the valuable information and the gaps by critiquing and comparing the content that was included in four recently released PNC guidelines from professional organizations. One of several barriers to implementing the available evidence-based maternity care guidelines is the lack of a woman-centered Lisa Hanson, CNM, PhD, FACNM, is an Associate Professor at Marquette University, College of Nursing, Midwifery Program, Milwaukee, WI.

Despite the lack of statistically significant findings, this study exposes several areas of interest and provides guidance for future studies evaluating prenatal care.Applying the chronic care model to prenatal care: Patient activation, productive interactions, and prenatal outcomes2018, Patient Education and CounselingCitation Excerpt :Education spans multiple subjects to include nutrition, exercise, medications, pregnancy, parenting, anticipatory guidance, breastfeeding, occupational and environmental exposures, postpartum depression and others. This content has been shown to influence a more positive outlook during pregnancy, improve pregnant women’s knowledge foundation, and support self-sufficiency [18]. According to Novick and colleagues [19], the qualities of the activated patient mirror those characteristics that contribute to a positive prenatal experience.Show abstractTo demonstrate how the chronic care model can be applied in prenatal care.This study was conducted through analysis of data generated in the women’s health and family medicine departments of one community hospital and two medical centers across three states (Georgia, Nevada, and Virginia). 159 low-risk obstetric patients were monitored throughout their pregnancy for patient activation and biometric measures including: blood pressure at each appointment, baby’s gestational age at birth, and mode of delivery. Patient activation was assessed with the validated, licensed patient activation measure.Patient activation was strongly associated with the Prenatal Interpersonal Processes of Care metric (F (2, 155) = 3.41, p < .05). Also, increased age, decreased Prenatal Interpersonal Processes of Care, fewer pregnancies, and increased diastolic blood pressure were associated with an increased likelihood of cesarean delivery and the model correctly predicted 81% of cases.Women who identified as feeling more activated reported more positive pregnancy experiences, and women who reported more positive pregnancy experiences were more likely to experience a vaginal delivery.Activated patients, more positive prenatal experience, and improved delivery outcomes can be achieved through applying the chronic care model.Society of Interventional Radiology Position Statement on Parental Leave2017, Journal of Vascular and Interventional RadiologyPregnant women: What do they need to know during pregnancy? A descriptive study2017, Women and BirthCitation Excerpt :Emotional changes are viewed as a normal occurrence during pregnancy. Accordingly, women’s lack of concern regarding emotional and social stressors during antenatal care was evident in previous research.9,12 The current study highlighted that women’s learning needs may differ depending on factors such as educational level, migrant status and age.Show abstractAntenatal education programs provide women with essential knowledge and skills in various aspects of maternal and fetal health. Antenatal education is based on improving women's health, reducing the risks of complications and enhancing couples’ positive experience during childbirth. There is a lack of formal antenatal educational programs based on women’s needs in Jordan.This study sought to identify and prioritize the learning needs for women during pregnancy.A descriptive cross-sectional design was employed. The study sample was recruited from three maternal and child health centers. Data were collected from a convenient sample of 150 pregnant women during their antenatal visits. One hundred and twenty three participants (response rate = 82%) completed the self-reported antenatal learning needs questionnaire.Women identified their most important learning needs were related to managing major complications of pregnancy (mean = 3.49, SD = 0.78), investigations and physician follow-up visit during pregnancy (mean = 3.42, SD = 0.71), appropriate diet (mean = 3.36, SD = 0.84) and information about medication and supplements (mean = 3.22, SD = 0.97). Spearman correlation showed negative association between participants’ age and physical (r = −0.536, p = 0.015) and emotional concerns (r = −0.490, p = 0.001). Women who had a diploma or higher degree reported greater concern regarding physical (median = 4.00, IQR = 3.00–4.00, p = 0.047) and emotional changes (median = 3.33, IQR = 3.00–4.00, p = 0.004). Finally, migrant participants showed greater significant concern regarding emotional changes and coping with minor complications.A large proportion of pregnant women in this study reported a high degree of importance of specific learning topics that were closely relevant to their current period of pregnancy. The lack of focusing on issues related to maternal emotional status and possible complications suggests a need for a national strategy to provide antenatal education based on women’s perceptions of their needs.Preconception and Prenatal Care2016, Obstetrics: Normal and Problem PregnanciesA tri-service perspective on the implementation of a centering pregnancy model in the military2012, JOGNN - Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal NursingShow abstractWith the rising cost of health care, group prenatal care has come into the forefront as a viable, evidence‐based option for care delivery.
