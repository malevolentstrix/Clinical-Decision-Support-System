For patients with a history of headache, the effect of pregnancy on the frequency and severity of headache, the effect of headache on pregnancy outcome, and the fetal safety of maternal headache treatment are major concerns. For patients with new onset of headache during pregnancy or postpartum, a diagnostic evaluation is indicated and should include evaluation for pregnancy-related causes of headache. Preeclampsia with severe features always needs to be excluded in pregnant patients over 20 weeks of gestation with a headache.This topic will discuss issues specific to diagnosis and management of headache in pregnant and postpartum patients. The diagnosis and treatment of headaches in the general population are reviewed separately. (See "Evaluation of headache in adults" and "Evaluation of the adult with nontraumatic headache in the emergency department".)DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATIONPatients requiring prompt evaluationPatients ≥20 weeks of gestation (evaluate for preeclampsia) — Preeclampsia must be considered in every pregnant patient over 20 weeks of gestation with headache. ●Prevalence – Among pregnant patients with no history of a headache and the onset of new or atypical headache who present for evaluation, one-third have preeclampsia [2].●Diagnostic criteria – Criteria for diagnosis of preeclampsia are described in the table and form the basis for evaluation (table 1). The diagnosis can be excluded in most normotensive patients. (See "Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis".)To continue reading this article, you must log in with your personal, hospital, or group practice subscription.
