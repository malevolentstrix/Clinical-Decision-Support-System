Eleven women from Syria enrolled at antenatal clinics, who were experiencing their first pregnancy in Sweden but who may have given birth before in other countries, were interviewed in 2020. The interviews were open and based on one initial question. Data were inductively analysed using a phenomenological method.ResultsThe essence of Syrian women’s experiences of being pregnant and receiving care at antenatal clinics for the first time after migration was the importance of being met with understanding to create trust to build a sense of confidence. The following four constituents capture the essence of the women’s experiences: “It was important to feel welcomed and to be treated like an equal”; “A good relationship with the midwife strengthened self-confidence and trust”; “Good communication despite language difficulties and cultural differences was important”; and “Previous experience of pregnancy and care influenced the experience of the care received”.ConclusionSyrian women's experiences reveal a heterogeneous group with different experiences and background. The study highlights the first visit and emphasises the importance of this visit for future quality of care. It also points out the negative occurrence of the transferring guilt from the midwife to the migrant woman in case of cultural insensitivity and clashing norm systems.Previous article in issueNext article in issueKeywordsPregnancyAntenatal careMigrantsQualitative researchInterviewLoading...Recommended articlesCited by (0)1Shared first authorship.© 2023 The Author(s).
