In a retrospective, registry-based cohort study, we identified women delivering in Denmark from 1978 to 2007 with a first singleton pregnancy (n=782,287) and first and second singleton pregnancies (n=536,419). First-trimester bleeding is defined as vaginal bleeding before 12 full weeks of gestation. We employed multivariate logistic regression with adjustment for maternal age and calendar year. First-trimester bleeding increased the risk of delivery in weeks 32-36 from 3.6% to 6.1% (odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-1.77) and in weeks 28-31 from 0.3% to 0.9% (OR 2.98; 95% CI 2.50-3.54) and increased the risk of placental abruption from 1.0% to 1.4% (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.30-1.68). First-trimester bleeding in the first pregnancy increased the risk of recurrence in the second pregnancy from 2.2% to 8.2% (OR 4.05; 95% CI 3.78-4.34), preterm delivery from 2.7% to 4.8% (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.67-2.00), and placental abruption from 0.9% to 1.0% (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07-1.56) in the second pregnancy. Women with first-trimester bleeding in the first pregnancy have an increased risk of complications later in the first pregnancy and of recurrence of first-trimester bleeding and other complications in the second pregnancy. .

First-Trimester Vaginal Bleeding andComplications Later in PregnancyJacob Alexander Lykke,MD, Katrine Lehrmann Dideriksen,MD, Øjvind Lidegaard,MD,DMSc,and Jens Langhoff-Roos,MD,DMScOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of first-trimesterbleeding without miscarriage and complications later in thefirst pregnancy as well as in the next pregnancy.METHODS: In a retrospective, registry-based cohort study,we identified women delivering in Denmark from 1978 to2007 with a first singleton pregnancy (nⴝ782,287) and first andsecond singleton pregnancies (nⴝ536,419). First-trimesterbleeding is defined as vaginal bleeding before 12 full weeks ofgestation. We employed multivariate logistic regression withadjustment for maternal age and calendar year.RESULTS: First-trimester bleeding increased the risk ofdelivery in weeks 32–36 from 3.6% to 6.1% (odds ratio [OR],1.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57–1.77) and in weeks28–31 from 0.3% to 0.9% (OR 2.98; 95% CI 2.50–3.54) andincreased the risk of placental abruption from 1.0% to 1.4%(OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.30–1.68).First-trimester bleeding in the first pregnancy increasedthe risk of recurrence in the second pregnancy from 2.2% to8.2% (OR 4.05; 95% CI 3.78–4.34), preterm delivery from2.7% to 4.8% (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.67–2.00), and placentalabruption from 0.9% to 1.0% (OR 1.29; 95% CI 1.07–1.56) inthe second pregnancy.CONCLUSION: Women with first-trimester bleeding inthe first pregnancy have an increased risk of complica-tions later in the first pregnancy and of recurrence offirst-trimester bleeding and other complications in thesecond pregnancy.(Obstet Gynecol 2010;115:935–44)LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IIFirst-trimester vaginal bleeding is one of the mostcommon complications in pregnancy with an inci-dence of 15–25%. About half of these will end inmiscarriage within 20 weeks of gestation,1,2 and thosewomen who remain pregnant have an increased risk ofdeveloping other complications later in pregnancy.3–13Local hemostatic factors in the uterus duringimplantation, decidualization, and early pregnancy,for example, tissue factor expressed in cytotropho-blasts,14 and systemic factors in the women during theongoing pregnancy15 seem to play distinct roles in asuccessful pregnancy; dysfunction of any of thesefactors could lead to an adverse outcome16; for exam-ple, local formation of thrombin and soluble fms-liketyrosine kinase-1. Both of these seem to be involvedin development of placental abruption and pre-eclampsia.14We hypothesize that first-trimester bleeding is amarker of a general proclivity to other pregnancycomplications surfacing later in the pregnancy. Also,this proclivity will resurface in the next pregnancy aseither first-trimester bleeding or other pregnancycomplications or both.Several studies have investigated the consequencesof bleeding on the risk of complications later in the samepregnancy but not the association between two pregnan-cies. Therefore, we have designed a registry-based,retrospective cohort study investigating 1) the associa-tion between first-trimester bleeding and complicationslater in the first pregnancy and 2) the association be-tween first-trimester bleeding in the first pregnancy andlater pregnancy complications in the second pregnancyas well as the opposite association.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe National Patient Registry has collected informationon all discharge diagnoses and complications duringpregnancy and delivery in Denmark since 1978.17 Weextracted information on all singleton deliveries in Den-mark from January 1, 1978, to October 1, 2007, whichA list of diagnoses and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-8 andICD-10 codes pertaining to this article is available in the Appendix online athttp://links.lww.com/AOG/A171.From the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Roskilde Hospital, Roskilde; andthe Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.Corresponding author: Jacob Alexander Lykke, MD, Department of Obstetricsand Gynecology, Roskilde Hospital, Kogevej 7, 4000 Roskilde, Denmark;e-mail: dr.lykke@dadlnet.dk.Financial DisclosureThe authors did not report any potential conflicts of interest.© 2010 by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Fromthis population, we defined two cohorts free of cardio-vascular morbidity, such as chronic hypertension andprevious ischemic heart disease. Cohort 1 was definedas women aged 15 to 50 years with a first delivery(n⫽796,915), excluding those with a preceding cardio-vascular diagnosis (n⫽11,605; 1.5%) or insulin-depen-dent and non–insulin-dependent diabetes (n⫽2,387;0.3%) and women who died or emigrated within 3months of delivery (n⫽65 and n⫽571, respectively).Cohort 1 consists of 782,287 women. Cohort 2 (asubpopulation of cohort 1) was defined as women witha second singleton delivery. Cohort 2 consists of 536,419women.The primary exposure was first-trimester bleedingdefined as vaginal bleeding verified by a physician, thatis, women referred to a clinic and diagnosed by aphysician after having vaginal bleeding before 12 com-pleted weeks of gestation. Gestational age was calculatedfrom date of bleeding, date of delivery, and the reportedgestational age at delivery. Of note, women with subse-quent miscarriage or induced abortion before 20 com-pleted weeks were not included in the study population.Women with bleeding and unknown gestational agewere considered controls because we could not classifythem as first-trimester bleedings. Likewise, manywomen with missing values of fetal growth wereconsidered controls because of missing values ingestational age.The outcomes (and secondary exposures) werepreterm delivery, premature rupture of membranes(PROM), hypertensive pregnancy disorders, fetalgrowth, placental abruption, and stillbirth after 20weeks of gestation. At delivery, gestational age andbirth weight were recorded routinely. Initially, gesta-tional age was assessed by the last menstruationperiod; gradually from 1978 to 2007, gestational agewas determined by early second-trimester ultrasonog-raphy. A priori, we stratified preterm delivery intofour groups by gestational age: 20–27, 28–31, and32–37 completed weeks; we used deliveries after 37completed weeks as the reference group. Fetal growthwas measured by the birth weight standardized forsex and gestational age.18 Small for gestational age(SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) weredefined as fetal growth 2 standard deviations (SDs)below and above the mean, respectively. Of note, wedid not standardize for parity, which produces ahigher proportion of SGA in the first pregnancycompared with the second pregnancy.Analyzing preterm delivery and PROM, we ex-cluded pregnancies complicated by hypertensive preg-nancy disorders, SGA, placental abruption, and stillbirthto accrue a surrogate for spontaneous delivery.Implausible values of birth weight, gestationalage, fetal growth, and the combination of these werereassigned as missing values (n⫽963). Missing valueswere analyzed as a separate group. These occurredmore frequently in the earlier years of the Registry.The presence of vaginal bleeding, PROM, hyper-tensive pregnancy disorders, placental abruption, still-birth, and cardiovascular diseases were assessed bythe specific International Classification of Diseases-8and -10 codes for these diagnoses (see the Appendix,available online at http://links.lww.com/A171).Given the binomial nature of these variables in theRegistry, no missing values were recorded. The hy-pertensive pregnancy disorders were stratified intogestational hypertension, mild preeclampsia, and se-vere preeclampsia (including eclampsia and HELLPsyndrome). The definition of preeclampsia haschanged little during the 30-year study period,19 andthe frequency of preeclampsia in the Registry hasremained almost stable. The accuracy of the diag-noses of the hypertensive pregnancy disorders in theRegistry has in subpopulations been manually vali-dated several times, accruing specificities above 99%for all types, but sensitivities at 10% for gestationalhypertension and 69% for preeclampsia or positivepredictive values of 56% for gestational hypertension,100% for severe preeclampsia, and 74% for mild andsevere preeclampsia combined.19We used multivariable logistic regression to cal-culate the associations. We included maternal age andyear of delivery in all models and years betweenpregnancies in associations across two pregnancies.Initially we calculated stratified results, some of whichare presented in the article. All odds ratios (ORs) arepresented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). SPSS16.0 for Macintosh (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) was usedfor all calculations. The study was approved by theDanish Data Protection Agency (2005–41–5262 and2007–41–1544).RESULTSThe mean age at delivery was 26.8 (SD 4.6) years incohort 1, and 25.9 (SD 4.0) and 29.5 (SD 4.2) years incohort 2, the first and second deliveries, respectively.In cohort 1, 18,311 (2.3%) women had bleeding; incohort 2, 11,563 (2.2%) and 12,262 (2.3%) women hadfirst-trimester bleeding in the first and second deliv-eries, respectively.In cohort one, women with first-trimester bleed-ing had an increased risk of delivering preterm laterin the same pregnancy. The proportion of women936 Lykke et al Bleeding and Pregnancy Complications OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY experiencing first-trimester bleeding increased by de-creasing gestational age at delivery (Table 1). First-trimester bleeding increased the risk of preterm de-livery in weeks 32–36 from 3.6% to 6.1% (OR 1.65;95% CI 1.57–1.77) and in weeks 28–31 from 0.3% to0.9% (OR 2.98; 95% CI 2.50–3.54). In addition,women with first-trimester bleeding had a 1.19-fold(95% CI 1.11–1.28) increased risk of PROM and1.18-fold (95% CI 1.01–1.37) increased risk of pre-term PROM, thus illustrating no effect modificationby gestational age of PROM. Also, women withfirst-trimester bleeding had a 1.48-fold (95% CI 1.30–1.68) increased risk of placental abruption (Table 1).In cohort 2, first-trimester bleeding in the firstpregnancy increased the risk from 2.2% to 8.2% (OR4.05; 95% CI 3.78–4.34) of first-trimester bleeding inthe second pregnancy (Table 2). Also, first-trimesterbleeding in the first pregnancy increased the risk ofpreterm delivery in the second pregnancy from 2.7%to 4.8% (OR 1.83; 95% CI 1.67–2.00), PROM from3.1% to 4.1% (OR 1.40; 95% CI 1.27–1.54), placentalabruption from 0.9% to 1.0% (OR 1.29; 95% CI1.07–1.56), and stillbirth from 0.4% to 0.5% (OR 1.34;95% CI 1.02–1.76) (Table 3). Only in the associationwith preterm delivery did we detect an effect modifi-cation by first-trimester bleeding in the second preg-nancy and by preterm delivery in the first pregnancy(Tables 4 and 5); these factors diminished the effect offirst-trimester bleeding in the first pregnancy. We alsoinvestigated the reverse association: women deliver-ing preterm at gestational ages of 32–36 weeks in thefirst pregnancy had a 1.41-fold (95% CI 1.29–1.55)increased risk of first-trimester bleeding in the secondpregnancy.

No effect modification bybleeding in the first pregnancy was observed in thestratified analyzes (Table 7).DISCUSSIONPrevious studies have linked first-trimester vaginalbleeding to preterm delivery,7–12 PROM,9,10,20 andplacental abruption8,10,21 in the same pregnancy. Wefound that first-trimester bleeding in the first preg-nancy tends to recur and also carries a risk of com-plications over to the second pregnancy. Also, pre-term delivery, PROM, and placental abruption in thefirst pregnancy carry a risk over to the second preg-nancy of first-trimester bleeding.The association between SGA and first-trimesterbleeding—in the first pregnancy and across first andsecond pregnancies—was small and inconsistent, andprevious studies have had difficulty in demonstratingthe association9–11; in our study, first-trimester bleed-ing did not increase the risk of LGA. Also, preeclamp-sia was weakly associated with first-trimester bleedingin the first pregnancy; Weiss et al previously havereported an increased risk of preeclampsia after “lightbleeding,” but strangely not after “heavy bleeding,”and, in contrast, Eskild and Vatten found a protectiveeffect of early bleeding on the risk of developingpreeclampsia.10,22 Stillbirth was not associated withfirst-trimester bleeding in the first pregnancy; how-ever, stillbirth in the first pregnancy increased the riskTable 3.

This suggests a common proclivity offirst-trimester bleeding and preterm delivery, PROM,and placental abruption.The strengths and weaknesses of the study arebased on the nature of the employed National PatientRegistry, a large population-based cohort represent-ing a census of delivering women. An incidence of2.3% of first-trimester bleeding seems low in compar-ison with previous studies1; for example, Mulik et alreported a 7.1% incidence.8Although there was un-derreporting, this difference may be ascribed to theinclusion of only viable pregnancies beyond 20 weeksof gestation.2Furthermore, the registry will includeinformation only on women who sought medicalassistance and were referred to a physician. In conse-quence, the woman herself could act as a bias: If awoman had serious complications in her first preg-Table 6.

How-ever, because of the prospective registration of thedata, recall bias is not present.The validity of the hypertensive diagnoses in theNational Patient Registry, demonstrating positive pre-dictive values of 56% of gestational hypertension and74% for preeclampsia,19 warrants caution when inter-preting the associations to these complications: Thelow-to-moderate predictive values will tend to under-estimate the associations. Validation of PROM, pla-cental abruption, and stillbirth remains to be per-formed.Potential confounders such as socioeconomic sta-tus, assisted reproductive technology or fecundability,smoking, and body mass index could not be assessedin the present study. These could be risk factors forboth vaginal bleeding and later pregnancy complica-tions. Also, we could not distinguish between lightand heavy bleeding,10,20 the presence of ultrasound-verified hematomas,13 or inflammation,28,30 all ofwhich have been associated with adverse pregnancyoutcomes. Thus, the weaker associations should beinterpreted with caution. However, the potential biasaffects the biological interpretation of the associations,not the statistical predictive value of first-trimestervaginal bleeding for later pregnancy complications.In conclusion, first-trimester vaginal bleeding is aclinical, relevant event for the obstetrician as a markerfor preterm delivery, PROM, and placental abruptionin the index pregnancy as well as in the subsequentpregnancy; these findings add to the evidence of thelinkage and recurrence of pregnancy complications.31The linkage to these pregnancy complications mayprovide a basis for selective increased pregnancysurveillance as well as insight into the etiology ofmiscarriage, vaginal bleeding, and other pregnancycomplications.REFERENCES1.

Most of the maternal outcomes are serious and carries significant morbidity and sometimes mortality if not predicted, early diagnosed, and timely managed, these complications include, preeclampsia/ eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) antepartum hemorrhage (APH); placenta Previa abruption placenta, and other APH (Dogra et al. 2005;Keith Edmonds, 2007). Another complication is the preterm prelabour rupture of membranes PPROM (Dogra et al., 2005), preterm labor PTL (Lykke et al., 2010), and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Early pregnancy bleeding may also affect the mode of delivery (Hosseini & Yaghoubipour, 2013;Saraswat et al., 2010;Rozina et al., 2016 study done in Pakistan). ...... Early pregnancy bleeding may also affect the mode of delivery (Hosseini & Yaghoubipour, 2013;Saraswat et al., 2010;Rozina et al., 2016 study done in Pakistan). According to several studies, there are also a number of adverse fetal and neonatal outcomes of EPB including; mainly prematurity (Lykke et al., 2010;Berkowitz et al., 1983), low birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) (Dogra et al., 2005), and perinatal mortality . Indicators of perinatal morbidity such as Apgar scores, neonatal unit admission, and presence of congenital malformations were significantly more among women with EPB (Dogra et al., 2005;Batzofin et al., 1984;Dadkah, 2010). ...... Moreover, thrombin is an uterotonic agent that may cause preterm labour during late pregnancy (Lockwood et al., 2007). The prevalence of PPROM is significantly higher among cases with EPB in agreement with other studies conducted by (Hosseini & Yaghoubipour, 2013;Lykke et al., 2010). ...Impact of Early pregnancy bleeding on maternal and fetal outcome 1ArticleFull-text availableJan 2020 Zahia Elghazal Fawzia hamad ElhararyAlla I AltaybZ S ElghazalHighlights  A descriptive cross-sectional study, on impact early pregnancy bleeding  Assess the effect of EPB on maternal outcome  Assess the effect of EPB on fetal outcome  Close monitoring and proper management among EPB women is advised Background: Vaginal bleeding is a common event at all stages of pregnancy, and early pregnancy bleeding during the first and second trimester (EPB) is a common symptom during pregnancy. EPB could have adverse effects on pregnancy and neonate. Objective: Is to assess the effects of early pregnancy bleeding on both mother and fetus. Patients and methods: A descriptive , cross-sectional study was conducted at Benghazi medical center (BMC); all the eligible women attended the obstetric ward for delivery in the period between the 1 st of August and 31 th of December 2016 were included. Data collected by direct interview and from medical records. Data analyzed using SPSS ver. 23. Descriptive statistics were obtained, and means, standard deviation, and frequency distribution were calculated. Chi square test was used, P< 0.05 considered as statistically significant. Results: Out of the 1404 women, 125 (9%) women had a history of early pregnancy bleeding (EPB). Pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-ec-lamptic toxemia, antepartum hemorrhage, preterm labor, and premature rupture of the membrane were significantly (P<0.05) more frequent among women with a history of early bleeding. Ninety-four (3.5%) women had a history of antepartum hemorrhage, for 27 (1.9%) of them, the cause was due to placenta abruption, while for 22 (1.6%) women the cause was pla-centa previa. The occurrence of both placenta previa and placenta abruption was significantly (P<0.05) more among women with a history of EPB. Fetal health problems and early neonatal death were significantly (P<0.05) more among mothers with EPB. Conclusion: Serious maternal morbidities are significantly associated with EPB as PET, APH, and PROM. Also prema-turity, IUGR, low birth weight, increase risk of neonatal ward admission and perinatal mortality are significantly more among women EPB. Recommendation: Proper antenatal care for early diagnosis, close follow up, and proper management of women with early pregnancy bleeding strongly recommended.ViewShow abstract... • Impaired invasion of cytotrophoblasts and remodeling of spiral arteries in early placentation, which are complicated by preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and placental abruption. 6 • Iron deposit due to bleeding may provoke excess oxidative stress that is linked to preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and premature rupture of membranes (PROM). 6 • Excess amount of thrombin may be released in response to tissue factor activation due to the bleed, which could impede the ongoing implantation. ...... 6 • Excess amount of thrombin may be released in response to tissue factor activation due to the bleed, which could impede the ongoing implantation. 6 As does a threatened miscarriage may result in loss of pregnancy, similarly, the probability that the common initial trigger causing a significant adverse pregnancy outcome and fetal effects cannot be neglected.

The study aimed to review the existing data on the best predictive value of pregnancy latency for known biomarkers in pregnancies after preterm premature rupture of membranes. The following databases were screened for the purposes of this systematic review: Pubmed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. The study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Only a few studies assessed biomarkers predicting pregnancy duration after PPROM. IL-6, IL-8, CRP, IL1RA, s-endoglin, βhCG, AFP, PCT, urea, creatinine, oxygen radical absorbance capacity, MDA, lipocalin-2, endotoxin activity, MMP-8, MMP-9 and S100 A8/A9 were found to have a positive predictive value for delivery timing prediction. Proinflammatory biomarkers, such as IL-6 or CRP, proved to be best correlated with delivery timing, independent of the occurrence of intrauterine infection.ViewShow abstract...

For the second pregnancy, there is a bleeding risk in 2.2 to 8.2% of cases, prematurity in 2.2 to 8.2% of cases, and retroplacental hematoma in 0.9 to 1% of cases. ...First Trimester Bleeding in Pregnancy within the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department of Sourô Sanou Teaching Hospital in BoboDioulasso: 422 Cases Studied and Literature ReviewArticleDec 2022Bambara MoussaOuedraogo IssaKomboïgo EvelyneNgono FrancisObjectives: Study the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic and prognostic aspects of the first trimester bleeding of pregnancy. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted within the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department of Sourô Sanou Teaching Hospital from January 1st to December 31st, 2019. The study included any patients admitted and treated for endo uterine bleeding in pregnancy with a term inferior or equal to 15 weeks of amenorrhea. The parameters studied were the following: sociodemographic characteristics (age, parity, level of education, occupation, marital status, origin), clinical and paraclinical aspects, diagnosis retained, treatment, and maternal prognosis. Information was collected from a survey form, from clinical records, operating protocols and anatomopathological reports. Data entry and analysis was made through Word and Epi-info 7.2.3 software. Results: During the period of study, 422 cases of first trimester bleeding were reported, corresponding to a frequency of 10.33%. The average age was 29 ± 6.4 years [15-49 years] and the average parity was 1.95 ± 1.7 [0-11]. Married women accounted for 75% of the population. The average gestational age was 9.14 weeks of amenorrhea [5-14 weeks of amenorrhea]. Clinical signs were dominated by vulvar bleeding in 100% of cases and pelvic pains in 86% of cases. All our patients had gone through pelvic ultrasound. As for the diagnoses retained, these included: a threatened abortion in 11.84% of cases, an incomplete abortion (46.77% of cases), an ectopic pregnancy (EP) (26.8% of cases), a terminated pregnancy (17.9% the cases) and a molar pregnancy (8.3% of cases).Abortions were managed through MVA (68.27%) and medical abortion (4.8%). All the cases of EP were treated surgically and no maternal deaths were recorded in our study. Conclusion: First trimester bleeding in pregnancy is common within the department. The main etiologies are threatened abortion, incomplete abortion, molar pregnancy and ectopic pregnancy.ViewShow abstract... Risk Factors of PTB PTB has been associated with many risk factors including: inadequate antenatal care [34]- [37], antepartum hemorrhage [34], [38], [39], preeclampsia [34], [40], nulliparity [35], [37], [41] short interpregnancy interval [35], [42], [43], maternal age <20 years [35], [36], [44]- [46], advanced maternal age (≥ 35 years) [46], single status of mothers [35], [45], history of PTB [47]- [49], history of abortion [36], [45], [50], advanced maternal age [45], [46], [49] , pre-pregnancy hypertension [49], [51], history of fetal demise [45], underweight mothers [46], [52], [53], rst antenatal visit after the rst trimester [37], [54], lower education of mothers [41], smoking in pregnancy [55], prior cesarean delivery [42], [56], and pre-pregnancy diabetes [51]. ...Machine Learning Prediction of Preterm Birth: An Analysis of Facility-Based Paper Health Records in UgandaPreprintFull-text availableJul 2022Shaheen MemonRobert WamalaIgnace KabanoPurpose: Preterm Birth (PTB) is one of the leading causes of neonatal mortality in Uganda. Machine Learning (ML) can be used to identify women at risk of PTB in time for medical intervention and adequate preparation by mothers. Methods: We utilized data from paper-based maternal health records at Kawempe National Referral Hospital, Uganda. A case-control method was employed, where for every woman who experienced a PTB, a woman without PTB and delivered in the same day was selected as a control. Treatment of missing data was done using Random Forest imputation. Variable Importance was analyzed using Random Forest. The following classification methods were applied in the prediction of PTB: Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naïve Bayes (NB). Performance of methods was investigated using prediction accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Results: 1,540 women were included in the study, where 770 women had experienced PTB, and 770 women formed the controls. According to variable importance analysis, number of antenatal care visits had the biggest impact on PTB. SVM had the highest accuracy in predicting PTB at 64% (sensitivity 64% and sensitivity 63%). Conclusions: Prediction of PTB using paper-based records in a developing country yielded similar results to studies done using electronic health records in developed countries. The predictive power could be low in this study due to fewer variables available from routinely collected ANC data. The inclusion of significant variables in the maternal records could potentially increase predictive power.ViewShow abstractAmerican Society of Hematology, ABHH, ACHO, Grupo CAHT, Grupo CLAHT, SAH, SBHH, SHU, SOCHIHEM, SOMETH, Sociedad Panameña de Hematología, SPH, SVH 2023 guidelines for diagnosis of venous thromboembolism and management in children and pregnant women in Latin AmericaArticleFull-text availableMar 2023Ignacio Neumann Ariel IzcovichRicardo Aguilar Holger J SchünemannBackground: Implementation of international guidelines in Latin American settings requires additional considerations (i.e., values and preferences, resources, accessibility, feasibility, and impact on health equity). Objective: To provide evidence-based guidelines about diagnosis of VTE and management in children and during pregnancy. Methods: We used the GRADE ADOLOPMENT method to adapt recommendations from three American Society of Hematology, ASH, VTE guidelines (Diagnosis of VTE, VTE in Pregnancy and VTE in Pediatric population). ASH and 12 local hematology societies formed a guideline panel comprised of medical professionals from 10 countries in Latin America. Panelists prioritized 10 questions about VTE diagnosis and 18 about management in special populations that were relevant for the Latin American context. A knowledge synthesis team updated evidence reviews of health effects conducted for the original ASH guidelines and summarized information about factors specific to the Latin American context. Results: In comparison with the original guideline, there were significant changes in 2/10 diagnostic recommendations (changes in the diagnostic algorithms) and in 9/18 management recommendations (4 changed direction and 5 changed strength). Conclusions: This guideline ADOLOPMENT project highlighted the importance of contextualization of recommendations in other settings, based on differences in values, resources, feasibility and health equity impact.ViewShow abstractSex with Bleeding in the First TrimesterChapterOct 2022 Hugo Madar Aurélien Mattuizzi Hanane BouchghoulLoïc SentilhesPregnant women and their partners often ask healthcare professionals whether sex is safe during pregnancy, and what consequences may result from sexual activity. Many clinicians can also be unsure of the answers to these type of questions, leading to both patient and clinician resorting to the internet for advice, which can be inaccurate and anxiety-inducing. Here, the authors provide clinicians with an insight into the information offered by 'Dr Google' so that they can reassure and advise their patients as necessary. Aimed at obstetricians and other physicians caring for pregnant women, this book reviews the implications of sex during pregnancy such as those complicated by medical conditions, those at risk of preterm birth and multiple pregnancies. Other chapters cover physiological changes during pregnancy that may affect sexual function and intimacy, as well as the differing guidelines provided by various global obstetric societies.ViewShow abstractThe predictive value of common symptoms in early pregnancy for complications later in pregnancy and at birthArticleFull-text availableOct 2022ACTA OBSTET GYN SCAN Ruth Ertmann Dagný Rós NicolaisdóttirJakob KragstrupVolkert SiersmaIntroduction: The aim was to investigate whether common pregnancy-related symptoms-nausea, vomiting, back pain, pelvic girdle pain, pelvic cavity pain, vaginal bleeding, itching of vulva, pregnancy itching, leg cramps, uterine contractions and varicose veins-in the first trimester of pregnancy add to the identification of women at high risk of future pregnancy and birth complications. Material and methods: Survey data linked to national register data. All women booking an appointment for a first prenatal visit in one of 192 randomly selected General Practices in East Denmark in the period April 2015-August 2016. The General Practices included 1491 women to this prospective study. Two outcomes, pregnancy complications and birth complications, were collected from the Danish Medical Birth Register. Results: Among the 1413 included women, 199 (14%) experienced complications in later pregnancy. The most serious complication, miscarriage, was experienced by 65 women (4.6%). Other common pregnancy complications were gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 11, 0.8%), gestational hypertension without proteinuria (n = 34, 2.4%), mild to moderate preeclampsia (n = 34, 2.4%) and gestational itching with effect on liver (n = 17, 1.2%). Women who experienced pelvic girdle pain, pelvic cavity pain or vaginal bleeding in the first trimester of pregnancy had a higher risk of pregnancy complications later on in later pregnancy. None of the other examined symptoms showed associations to pregnancy complications. No associations were found between pregnancy-related physical symptoms in first trimester and birth complications. Conclusions: Symptoms in early pregnancy do not add much information about the risk of pregnancy or birth complications, although pain and bleeding may give reason for some concern. This is an important message to women experiencing these common symptoms and to their caregivers.ViewShow abstractMetrorragias del primer trimestre del embarazoArticleMay 2022 Chloé Arthuis Stéphane PloteauJ.-M. Levaillant Nathaniel WinerResumen Alrededor del 25% de los embarazos sangran durante el primer trimestre. Un 50% de ellos evoluciona a aborto espontáneo. Las dos etiologías principales son el embarazo extrauterino (EEU) y el aborto espontáneo, pero deben descartarse otros diagnósticos. El diagnóstico se basa en la anamnesis y la exploración física, pero también en la determinación plasmática cuantitativa del componente β de la gonadotropina coriónica (βhCG) y la ecografía pélvica asociada con mucha frecuencia a la ecografía endovaginal. El tratamiento depende ante todo de la repercusión hemodinámica y, por supuesto, del diagnóstico etiológico. En caso de EEU, el tratamiento puede ser la abstención o un tratamiento médico o quirúrgico. En caso de embarazo no evolutivo, el tratamiento, antes quirúrgico en primer lugar, es ahora a menudo médico o abstencionista. La actitud expectante es clásica en caso de aborto incompleto. La anamnesis, la exploración física y la asociación ecobiológica permiten hacer el diagnóstico en la casi todos los casos.ViewShow abstractShow moreAssociation Between First-Trimester Vaginal Bleeding and MiscarriageArticleFull-text availableOct 2009OBSTET GYNECOLReem HasanDonna D. Baird Amy Herring Katherine Eubanks HartmannTo estimate the strength of association between first-trimester bleeding and miscarriage, setting aside bleeding at time of loss. Women enrolled in a community-based pregnancy cohort study before or during early pregnancy. Detailed first-trimester bleeding data were collected by telephone interview. Bleeding episodes proximal to miscarriage (within 4 days) were excluded. We used discrete-time hazard models to evaluate the association between bleeding and miscarriage. Models were adjusted for maternal age, prior miscarriage, and smoking. Exploratory regression tree analysis was used to evaluate the relative importance of other bleeding characteristics (duration, associated pain, color, timing). Of the 4,510 participants, 1,204 (27%) reported some first-trimester vaginal bleeding or spotting, and 517 miscarriages were observed. Eight percent of those with bleeding reported heavy bleeding episodes. When we evaluated any bleeding, including episodes of only spotting, the unadjusted relative odds ratio (OR) of miscarriage for women with bleeding (n=1,204) was 1.1 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9-1.3). However, women who reported heavy bleeding (n=97) had nearly three times the risk of miscarriage compared with women without bleeding during the first trimester (OR 3.0, 95% CI 1.9-4.6). Adjustment for covariates had little effect on estimates. Further analyses suggested that women with heavy bleeding accompanied by pain were the group accounting for most of the elevated risk. Heavy bleeding in the first trimester, particularly when accompanied by pain, is associated with higher risk of miscarriage. Spotting and light episodes are not, especially if lasting only 1-2 days. II.ViewShow abstractRecurring Complications in Second PregnancyArticleFull-text availableJul 2009OBSTET GYNECOL Jacob Alexander LykkeMichael Paidas Jens Langhoff-RoosTo clarify the obstetric consequences in a second pregnancy after a first singleton pregnancy complicated by spontaneous preterm delivery or preeclampsia and stratified by the variation in fetal growth. In a registry-based cohort study, we identified women having a first and second singleton delivery in Denmark from 1978 to 2007 (n=536,419). The exposures and endpoints were preterm delivery, preeclampsia, fetal growth, placental abruption, and stillbirth after 20 weeks of gestation. We used chi and t test to compare differences between incidences on first and second pregnancies. Compared with a spontaneous first delivery at term, a delivery between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation increased the risk of preterm delivery in the second pregnancy from 2.7% to 14.7% (odds ratio [OR] 6.12, 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.84-6.42) and the risk of preeclampsia from 1.1% to 1.8% (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.41-1.81); a delivery before 28 weeks increased the risk of a second preterm delivery to 26.0% (OR 13.1, 95% CI 10.8-15.9) and a second pregnancy with preeclampsia to 3.2% (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.80-4.88). A first delivery in preeclamptic women between 32 and 36 weeks, compared with delivery after 37 weeks, increased the risk of preeclampsia in a second pregnancy from 14.1% to 25.3% (OR 2.08, 95% CI 1.87-2.31) and a small for gestational age infant from 3.1% to 9.6% (OR 2.82, 95% CI 2.38-3.35). Compared with the mean, fetal growth 2 to 3 standard deviations below mean in the first pregnancy increased the risk of preeclampsia from 1.1% to 1.8% (OR 1.62, 95% CI 1.34-1.96) in the second pregnancy. Spontaneous preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and fetal growth deviation tend to recur and predispose to each other in a second pregnancy. Severe complications further increase these risks.

METHODS We conducted a literature review on the impact of first trimester complications in previous and index pregnancies using Medline and Cochrane databases covering the period 1980–2008. RESULTS Clinically relevant associations of adverse outcome in the subsequent pregnancy with an odds ratio (OR) > 2.0 after complications in a previous pregnancy are the risk of perinatal death after a single previous miscarriage, the risk of very preterm delivery (VPTD) after two or more miscarriages, the risk of placenta praevia, premature preterm rupture of membranes, VPTD and low birthweight (LBW) after recurrent miscarriage and the risk of VPTD after two or more termination of pregnancy. Clinically relevant associations of adverse obstetric outcome in the ongoing pregnancy with an OR > 2.0 after complications in the index pregnancy are the risk of LBW and very low birthweight (VLBW) after a threatened miscarriage, the risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, pre-eclampsia, placental abruption, preterm delivery (PTD), small for gestational age and low 5-min Apgar score after detection of an intrauterine haematoma, the risk of VPTD and intrauterine growth restriction after a crown-rump length discrepancy, the risk of VPTD, LBW and VLBW after a vanishing twin phenomenon and the risk of PTD, LBW and low 5-min Apgar score in a pregnancy complicated by severe hyperemesis gravidarum. CONCLUSIONS Data from our literature review indicate, by finding significant associations, that specific early pregnancy events and complications are predictors for subsequent adverse obstetric and perinatal outcome. Though, some of these associations are based on limited or small uncontrolled studies. Larger population-based controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. Nevertheless, identification of these risks will improve obstetric care.ViewShow abstractRecurring Complications in Second PregnancyArticleJun 2010Obstet Anesth Digest Jacob Alexander LykkeMichael Paidas Jens Langhoff-RoosViewDefective implantation and placentation: Laying the blueprint for pregnancy complicationsArticleJan 2007Errol R. NorwitzNormal implantation and placentation is critical for pregnancy success. Many pregnancy-related complications that present late in gestation (such as pre-eclampsia and preterm labour) appear to have their origins early in pregnancy with abnormalities in implantation and placental development. Implantation is characterized by invasion of the maternal tissues of the uterus by fetal trophoblast, and the degree to which trophoblast invades these tissues appears to be a major determinant of pregnancy outcome. Excessive invasion can lead to abnormally firm attachment of the placenta to the myometrium (placenta accreta) with increased maternal and perinatal morbidity. Inadequate invasion, specifically restricted endovascular invasion, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of such conditions as pre-eclampsia (gestational proteinuric hypertension), preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour, and intrauterine growth restriction. The molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for implantation remain enigmatic. This review will include an overview of implantation followed by a discussion of a number of molecular mechanisms implicated in defective implantation and placentation including the role of decidual prostaglandins and haemorrhage in regulating trophoblast invasion. An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for abnormal implantation and placentation will likely improve clinicians' abilities to treat disorders that occur along this continuum, including infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, pre-eclampsia, and preterm birth.ViewShow abstractMaternal and perinatal outcome in women with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester: A systematic reviewArticleNov 2009BJOG-INT J OBSTET GY Lucky SaraswatS Bhattacharya Abha MaheshwariThreatened miscarriage is a common complication in the first trimester of pregnancy and is often associated with anxiety regarding pregnancy outcome. We undertook a systematic review to explore the effects of threatened miscarriage in the first trimester on maternal and perinatal outcomes. An electronic literature search using MEDLINE and EMBASE, and bibliographies of retrieved primary articles. No language restrictions were applied. All studies analysing outcomes of first-trimester bleeding where viability was confirmed on ultrasound or the pregnancy continued beyond viability. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data on study characteristics, quality and accuracy. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager software. The outcome was broadly categorised into maternal and perinatal outcomes. The chief maternal outcomes included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes evaluated were preterm delivery, low birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal mortality, indicators of perinatal morbidity (Apgar scores and neonatal unit admission) and presence of congenital anomalies. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Women with threatened miscarriage had a significantly higher incidence of antepartum haemorrhage due to placenta praevia [odds ratio (OR) 1.62, 95% CI 1.19, 2.22] or antepartum haemorrhage of unknown origin (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.52, 4.02) when compared with those without first-trimester bleeding. They were more likely to experience PPROM (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.28, 2.48), preterm delivery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.76, 2.4) and to have babies with intrauterine growth restriction (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.18, 2.00). First-trimester bleeding was associated with significantly higher rates of perinatal mortality (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.41, 3.27) and low-birthweight babies (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.48, 2.28). Threatened miscarriage in the first trimester is associated with increased incidence of adverse maternal and perinatal outcome.ViewShow abstractAbnormal bleeding associated with preeclampsia: A population study of 315,085 pregnanciesArticleDec 2008ACTA OBSTET GYN SCAN Anne EskildLars J VattenTo study the association of preeclampsia with abnormal bleeding in the first trimester and after delivery. Register-based population study. Setting. The Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Population. A total of 315,085 women in Norway with singleton deliveries after 21 weeks of gestation (1999-2004). We compared frequencies of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester between women who subsequently developed preeclampsia and women without preeclampsia development, and made similar comparisons for postpartum bleeding. Proportion of women with bleeding. In the first trimester, vaginal bleeding occurred in 1.6% (215/13,166) of subsequent preeclampsia cases, compared to 2.0% (6,112/301,919) of normotensives (p<0.01). After delivery, excess postpartum bleeding (>1,500 mL) occurred in 3.0% (399/13,166) of preeclampsia cases and in 1.4% (4,223/301,919) of normotensives (p<0.01). Moderate bleeding postpartum (>500 mL) was also more common in preeclampsia cases (22.9% versus 13.9%, p<0.01). Similar patterns were present in first time mothers and in women with more than one birth, and the patterns did not vary according to type of delivery (cesarean section or not). These results suggest that factors associated with preeclampsia are inversely related to vaginal bleeding early in pregnancy, but positively associated with excess bleeding after delivery.ViewShow abstractAdverse infant outcomes associated with first-trimester vaginal bleedingArticleAug 1991OBSTET GYNECOL Michelle A.

Low birth weight (LBW), shortened gestation, LBW at term, and neonatal death occurred more often in women reporting first-trimester bleeding than in those who never bled. These relationships remained statistically significant after adjusting for confounding factors. Women who experienced vaginal bleeding limited to the first trimester (N = 1174) had double the risk of delivering a preterm infant compared with those experiencing no bleeding (adjusted risk ratio = 2.0; 95% confidence interval 1.6-2.5). Bleeding limited to the first trimester was associated with a 1.6-fold risk of delivery of a term LBW infant (95% confidence interval 1.3-2.0). These results suggest that first-trimester vaginal bleeding is an important correlate of adverse infant outcomes.ViewShow abstractHistological study of the materno-embryonic interface in spontaneous abortionArticleNov 1990PLACENTAJ Hustin Eric JauniauxJ P SchaapsIn a histological study of 184 specimens of complete spontaneous abortion, the following points were delineated. In cases of anomaly or death of the conceptus, there was a reduced trophoblastic penetration into the decidua and into the spiral arteries where physiological changes were limited or absent. Trophoblastic proliferation within the columns and the outer shell was limited with frequent disruption or even disappearance of the shell. These findings seem to be related to the untimely initiation of blood flow in the intervillous space which in turn is associated with arrest of pregnancy and eventual expulsion.ViewShow abstractThe Outcome of Pregnancy after Threatened AbortionArticleFeb 1985Jens B. HertzLars HeisterbergA prospectively collected group of 93 pregnancies complicated by threatened abortion was carefully monitored throughout pregnancy, during birth and in the perinatal period, and any deviation from a completely uneventful course was registered. Comparison was made with a selected group of 282 non-risk pregnant women. A significant association was found between threatened abortion and the overall number of complications in the second half of pregnancy requiring medical intervention and/or admission to hospital, impending pre-term birth requiring betamimetics, pre-term birth, retention of the placenta, birth weight below 2000 g, light-for-dates infants in case of pre-term birth or birth weight below 2000 g, and hyperbilirubinemia in infants with birth weight below 2000 g. The incidences of perinatal mortality and congenital malformations did not differ significantly from those of the control group. Pregnancies complicated by threatened abortion constitute a risk group requiring careful obstetric and perinatal supervision and follow-up.ViewShow abstractShow moreRecommended publicationsDiscover moreArticleFull-text availableThreatened abortion: A risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomeAugust 2008 · Acta medica Iranica Fateme Davari Tanha Mamak Shariat Mahbod Kaveh[...]S. JalalvandThe scientific literature regarding threatened abortion is relatively limited on the subject of outcomes and viability at term. To investigate prospectively the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome in women presenting with first-trimester threatened miscarriage, a prospective case control study was performed on 600 subjects, 150 women presenting with bleeding in the first trimester and 450 ... [Show full abstract] asymptomatic age-matched controls. Main outcome measures included gestational age and weight at delivery as well as incidence of adverse pregnancy outcome such as preterm labor, preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM), placental abruption, and low birth weight (LBW). The first-trimester miscarriage rate in the threatened miscarriage group was 42.7%. Compared with controls, women presenting with threatened miscarriage were more likely to deliver prematurely, 14.7% compared with 52.9%, respectively (relative risk 3.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.4-4.8). They were also more likely to have PPROM, 6.4% compared with 27.5%, respectively (relative risk 4.2, 95% CI 2.6-6.9); placental abruption, 5.7% compared with 1.5%, respectively (relative risk 3.6, 95% CI 1.2-11.3); LBW, 14.9% compared with 7.1%, respectively (relative risk 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.8) and low lying placenta, 1.1% compared with 18.2%, respectively. birth weight 2866 ± 523.3 g compared with 312.45± 591.4 respectively, gestational age 35.71 ± 4.3 compared with 38.07 ± 3.2 respectively.

Al‐MemarThibaut Vaulet Hanine Fourie[...] Thomas BourneObjective To assess prospectively the association between pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding, and nausea and vomiting occurring in the first trimester of pregnancy and the incidence of later adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods This was a prospective observational cohort study of consecutive women with confirmed intrauterine singleton pregnancy between 5 and 14 weeks' gestation recruited at Queen ... [Show full abstract] Charlotte's & Chelsea Hospital, London, UK, from March 2014 to March 2016. Serial ultrasound scans were performed in the first trimester. Participants completed validated symptom scores for vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, and nausea and vomiting. The key symptom of interest was any pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding during the first trimester. Pregnancies were followed up until the final outcome was known. Antenatal, delivery and neonatal outcomes were obtained from hospital records. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between first‐trimester symptoms and pregnancy complications by calculating adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with correction for maternal age. Results Of 1003 women recruited, 847 pregnancies were included in the final analysis following exclusion of cases due to first‐trimester miscarriage ( n = 99), termination of pregnancy ( n = 20), loss to follow‐up ( n = 32) or withdrawal from the study ( n = 5). Adverse antenatal complications were observed in 166/645 (26%) women with pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding in the first trimester (aOR = 1.79; 95% CI, 1.17–2.76) and in 30/181 (17%) women with no symptoms. Neonatal complications were observed in 66/634 (10%) women with and 11/176 (6%) without pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding (aOR = 1.73; 95% CI, 0.89–3.36). Delivery complications were observed in 402/615 (65%) women with and 110/174 (63%) without pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding during the first trimester (aOR = 1.16; 95% CI, 0.81–1.65). For 18 of 20 individual antenatal complications evaluated, incidence was higher among women with pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding, despite the overall incidences being low. Nausea and vomiting in pregnancy showed little association with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions Our study suggests that there is an increased incidence of antenatal complications in women experiencing pelvic pain and/or vaginal bleeding in the first trimester. This should be considered when advising women attending early‐pregnancy units. Copyright © 2019 ISUOG.

However, its outcome is a matter of debate. This study sought to assess the outcomes of pregnancies, complicated by FTVB. In this cohort study, 236 gravida 1 and 2 FTVB patients with delivery after 28 weeks of gestational age, admitted to Imam Hossein Hospital during 2009-2010, were evaluated. The control group ... [Show full abstract] consisted of 944 gravida 1 and 2 women without any history of vaginal bleeding. Late pregnancy outcomes such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm delivery, and premature rupture of membranes in the mothers and low birth weight (LBW), intrauterine growth restriction(IUGR), Apgar score at 5 min <7, and NICU admission in the infants were evaluated. Logistic regression was used for estimation of odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence interval. Compared to controls, the FTVB cases had more premature rupture of membranes (OR = 10), gestational hypertension (OR = 5.3), and placental abruption (OR = 4.7), while their infants had higher odds of LBW, IUGR, Apgar score at 5 min <7, and admission to NICU too. The incidence of premature rupture of membranes was 3.6 % in the controls and 27.1 % in the cases (RR = 10, P < 0.001). The incidence of gestational hypertension and LBW was 1.5 and 7.2 % (P < 0.001) in the controls and 6.6 and 12.3 % (P < 0.001) in the cases. The other outcomes were similar in both groups. FTVB may play a role in the development of late pregnancy outcomes in mothers and infants. Thus, it is recommended to evaluate some interventions on FTVB cases to prevent complications.Read moreArticleMaternal and perinatal outcome in women with threatened miscarriage in the first trimester: A system...November 2009 · BJOG An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology Lucky SaraswatS Bhattacharya Abha MaheshwariThreatened miscarriage is a common complication in the first trimester of pregnancy and is often associated with anxiety regarding pregnancy outcome. We undertook a systematic review to explore the effects of threatened miscarriage in the first trimester on maternal and perinatal outcomes. An electronic literature search using MEDLINE and EMBASE, and bibliographies of retrieved primary articles. ... [Show full abstract] No language restrictions were applied. All studies analysing outcomes of first-trimester bleeding where viability was confirmed on ultrasound or the pregnancy continued beyond viability. Two review authors independently selected studies and extracted data on study characteristics, quality and accuracy. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager software. The outcome was broadly categorised into maternal and perinatal outcomes. The chief maternal outcomes included pre-eclampsia/eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension, antepartum haemorrhage, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) and mode of delivery. The perinatal outcomes evaluated were preterm delivery, low birthweight, intrauterine growth restriction, perinatal mortality, indicators of perinatal morbidity (Apgar scores and neonatal unit admission) and presence of congenital anomalies. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Women with threatened miscarriage had a significantly higher incidence of antepartum haemorrhage due to placenta praevia [odds ratio (OR) 1.62, 95% CI 1.19, 2.22] or antepartum haemorrhage of unknown origin (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.52, 4.02) when compared with those without first-trimester bleeding. They were more likely to experience PPROM (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.28, 2.48), preterm delivery (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.76, 2.4) and to have babies with intrauterine growth restriction (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.18, 2.00). First-trimester bleeding was associated with significantly higher rates of perinatal mortality (OR 2.15, 95% CI 1.41, 3.27) and low-birthweight babies (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.48, 2.28). Threatened miscarriage in the first trimester is associated with increased incidence of adverse maternal and perinatal outcome.Read moreDiscover the world's researchJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.Join for free ResearchGate iOS AppGet it from the App Store now.InstallKeep up with your stats and moreAccess scientific knowledge from anywhere orDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?
