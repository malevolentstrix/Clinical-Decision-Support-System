infoFiguresTablesLinked ArticlesRelated Clinics SummaryBackgroundBlood pressure measurement is a marker of antenatal care quality. In well resourced settings, lower blood pressure cutoffs for hypertension are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. We aimed to study the associations between blood pressure thresholds and adverse outcomes and the diagnostic test properties of these blood pressure cutoffs in low-resource settings.MethodsWe did a secondary analysis of data from 22 intervention clusters in the Community-Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) cluster randomised trials (NCT01911494) in India (n=6), Mozambique (n=6), and Pakistan (n=10). We included pregnant women aged 15–49 years (12–49 years in Mozambique), identified in their community by trained community health workers, who had data on blood pressure measurements and outcomes. The trial was unmasked. Maximum blood pressure was categorised as: normal blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [sBP] <120 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure [dBP] <80 mm Hg), elevated blood pressure (sBP 120–129 mm Hg and dBP <80 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (sBP 130–139 mm Hg or dBP 80–89 mm Hg, or both), non-severe stage 2 hypertension (sBP 140–159 mm Hg or dBP 90–109 mm Hg, or both), or severe stage 2 hypertension (sBP ≥160 mm Hg or dBP ≥110 mm Hg, or both). We classified women according to the maximum blood pressure category reached across all visits for the primary analyses. The primary outcome was a maternal, fetal, or neonatal mortality or morbidity composite. We estimated dose-response relationships between blood pressure category and adverse outcomes, as well as diagnostic test properties.FindingsBetween Nov 1, 2014, and Feb 28, 2017, 21 069 women (6067 in India, 4163 in Mozambique, and 10 839 in Pakistan) contributed 103 679 blood pressure measurements across the three CLIP trials. Only women with non-severe or severe stage 2 hypertension, as discrete diagnostic categories, experienced more adverse outcomes than women with normal blood pressure (risk ratios 1·29–5·88). Using blood pressure categories as diagnostic thresholds (women with blood pressure within the category or any higher category vs those with blood pressure in any lower category), dose-response relationships were observed between increasing thresholds and adverse outcomes, but likelihood ratios were informative only for severe stage 2 hypertension and maternal CNS events (likelihood ratio 6·36 [95% CI 3·65–11·07]) and perinatal death (5·07 [3·64–7·07]), particularly stillbirth (8·53 [5·63–12·92]).InterpretationIn low-resource settings, neither elevated blood pressure nor stage 1 hypertension were associated with maternal, fetal, or neonatal mortality or morbidity adverse composite outcomes. Only the threshold for severe stage 2 hypertension met diagnostic test performance standards. Current diagnostic thresholds for hypertension in pregnancy should be retained.FundingUniversity of British Columbia, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.IntroductionHypertension in pregnancy has traditionally been defined as a systolic blood pressure (sBP) of at least 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (dBP) of at least 90 mm Hg, or both.1Scott G Gillon TE Pels A von Dadelszen P Magee LA Guidelines-similarities and dissimilarities: a systematic review of international clinical practice guidelines for pregnancy hypertension.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 0 (S0002-9378(20)30846-2.)Google Scholar Hypertension defined in this way identifies pregnant women at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and other maternal and fetal or neonatal complications, including death, and these women are recommended to receive enhanced antenatal care and monitoring worldwide.In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommended lowering the blood pressure thresholds for diagnosing hypertension outside of pregnancy, classified as: elevated blood pressure (or elevated sBP; defined as sBP 120–129 mm Hg and dBP <80 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (sBP 130–139 mm Hg or dBP 80–89 mm Hg, or both), and stage 2 hypertension (sBP ≥140 mm Hg or dBP ≥90 mm Hg, or both).2Whelton PK Carey RM Aronow WS et al.2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines.Hypertension. 2018; 71: 1269-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar Although the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and WHO have retained a definition of blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg for hypertension in pregnancy, several studies have reported a dose-response relationship between increasing blood pressure and adverse pregnancy outcomes, across gestational ages;3Sisti G Williams B Body of evidence in favor of adopting 130/80 mm Hg as new blood pressure cut-off for all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Medicina (Kaunas). 2019; 55: 703Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4Reddy M Rolnik DL Harris K et al.Challenging the definition of hypertension in pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 222: 606Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar these findings provide potential support for the redefinition of hypertension in pregnancy. However, despite use of blood pressure as an essential screening test in pregnancy, no studies have yet reported the diagnostic test properties (such as sensitivity and specificity) of various blood pressure thresholds for hypertension diagnosis.Research in contextEvidence before this studyWe searched MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, CNTRAL, LILACS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar databases, including reference lists of eligible studies, for studies published in English between Jan 1, 2017, and Dec 31, 2020, using the search terms “human” AND (“hypertension” OR “hypertensive disorders of pregnancy” OR “pregnancy-induced hypertension” OR “preeclampsia” OR “pregnancy toxemias” OR “gestational hypertension”) AND (“American College of Cardiology” OR “American Heart Association”) AND (“stage 1 hypertension” OR “prehypertension”) AND (“Pregnancy[mh]” OR “Pregnan*” OR “Gestation*” OR “pregnant women[mh]” OR “Pregnancy Complications[mh]” OR “Postpartum Period”[Mesh] OR “Puerperium” OR “postpartum” OR “Peripartum Period”[Mesh] OR “Peripartum*” OR “Perinatal Care[mh]” OR “perinatal”).In 2017, the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association recommended lowering blood pressure thresholds for diagnosing hypertension outside of pregnancy. Several studies have examined the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with these lower blood pressure values in pregnancy, compared with the established cutoff of 140/90 mm Hg or greater.Added value of this studyNearly all evidence for using the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association thresholds to diagnose hypertension in pregnancy are from high-income settings and rely on retrospective, routinely collected clinical data. Furthermore, these studies have focused exclusively on associative measures (such as risk ratios) between blood pressure thresholds and adverse outcomes. By contrast, this study provides prospective blood pressure data from more than 20 000 pregnant women, in three low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), using standardised measurement technique and a validated device, and examines not only associations between blood pressure thresholds and adverse outcomes, but also the diagnostic test properties of those thresholds. Associations were dependent on blood pressure greater than or equal to 160/110 mm Hg.Implications of all the available evidenceOur findings suggest that there is an association between the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association blood pressure thresholds and adverse pregnancy outcomes in LMIC settings, but there is no antenatal blood pressure threshold that is sensitive with regards to the adverse maternal, fetal, or neonatal outcomes studied, including data-driven cutoffs. However, severe stage 2 hypertension (blood pressure ≥160/110 mm Hg) is associated with a substantially increased risk of adverse maternal CNS outcomes and fetal or neonatal death, particularly stillbirth, and should be treated as per international guidance. Antenatal care must aim to provide more than accurate blood pressure measurement to achieve the Countdown 2030 goals.We aimed to analyse the relationship between blood pressure thresholds to define hypertension in pregnancy and adverse maternal, fetal, or neonatal outcomes, as well as the diagnostic test properties of these cutoffs, in low-resource settings.MethodsStudy design and participantsWe did a secondary analysis of data from 22 intervention clusters in the Community-Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) cluster randomised trials (NCT01911494) in India (n=6), Mozambique (n=6), and Pakistan (n=10).5Sevene E Sharma S Munguambe K et al.Community-Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) in Mozambique: a cluster randomised controlled trial.Pregnancy Hypertens. 2020; 21: 96-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 6Qureshi RN Sheikh S Hoodbhoy Z et al.Community-Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) in Pakistan: a cluster randomised controlled trial.Pregnancy Hypertens. 2020; 22: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 7Bellad MB Goudar SS Mallapur AA et al.Community Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) in India: a cluster randomised controlled trial.Pregnancy Hypertens. 2020; 21: 166-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 8von Dadelszen P Bhutta ZA Sharma S et al.The Community-Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia (CLIP) cluster randomised trials in Mozambique, Pakistan, and India: an individual participant-level meta-analysis.Lancet. 2020; 396: 553-563Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar The unit of randomisation (cluster) was the local administrative unit. We included pregnant women aged 15–49 years (12–49 years in Mozambique), identified in their community by trained community health workers, who had data on blood pressure measurements and outcomes. All women provided written informed consent to participate. The trial was unmasked given the nature of the intervention, aimed at addressing the so-called three delays in triage, transport, and treatment related to mortality risk, particularly associated with pre-eclampsia.9Thaddeus S Maine D Too far to walk: maternal mortality in context.Soc Sci Med. 1994; 38: 1091-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1809) Google ScholarEthics approvals were granted by the University of British Columbia, Canada (H12-03497) and relevant in-country research ethics boards (Aga Khan University, Pakistan, 2590-Obs-ERC-13; KLE University, India, MDC/IECHSR/2011-12/A-4, ICMR 5/7/859/12-RHN; Centro de Investigação em Saúde de Manhiça, Mozambique, CIBS-CISM/038/14; and Mozambique National Bioethic Committee, 219/CNBS/14).ProceduresFirst, community engagement addressed barriers and facilitators to accessing care. Second, existing cadres of community health workers were trained to task-share pregnancy hypertension-oriented care at CLIP contacts in women's homes, using the CLIP Pre-eclampsia Integrated Estimate of Risk Score (PIERS) On-the-Move (POM) digital health app for risk stratification.10Lim J Cloete G Dunsmuir DT et al.Usability and feasibility of PIERS on the move: an mHealth app for pre-eclampsia triage.JMIR Mhealth Uhealth. 2015; 3: e37Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar Community health workers responded to emergency conditions (if applicable); measured women's blood pressure and did dipstick urinalysis for proteinuria at the first and any subsequent contact where hypertension was identified; administered oral methyldopa (750 mg) if blood pressure was greater than or equal to 160/110 mm Hg and intramuscular magnesium sulphate (10 g) if severe pre-eclampsia (defined as at least one of: sBP ≥160 mm Hg, mini pre-eclampsia integrated estimate of risk [miniPIERS] probability ≥25%, eclampsia, or stroke) was suspected; and referred women to a comprehensive emergency obstetric care facility if advised by POM. Antenatal POM-guided visits (including blood pressure measurement) were scheduled monthly from enrolment.Blood pressure measurement for all women in the intervention clusters (and, therefore, in this analysis) was standardised and taken by trained community health workers, using a semi-automated pregnancy-validated and pre-eclampsia-validated oscillometric device (Microlife 3AS1-2; Microlife, Taipei, Taiwan).11Nathan HL de Greeff A Hezelgrave NL Chappell LC Shennan AH An accurate semiautomated oscillometric blood pressure device for use in pregnancy (including pre-eclampsia) in a low-income and middle-income country population: the Microlife 3AS1-2.Blood Press Monit. 2015; 20: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar Women were instructed to rest for 5 min, then their blood pressure was measured at least twice, with a third measurement taken if the first two readings differed by 10 mmHg or more. All readings were entered into the POM app, with blood pressure for the visit calculated as the mean of the first two readings, or of the second and third if three readings were taken. All readings were stored electronically in REDCap databases.Trained surveillance teams did regular household surveys (every 3–6 months) in Mozambique and Pakistan; in India, a prospective population-based surveillance system was established. The PRE-eclampsia Eclampsia Monitoring, Prevention, and Treatment (PRE-EMPT) research group, University of British Columbia, Canada, was responsible for overall trial coordination and data management.OutcomesThe primary CLIP composite outcome was a composite of maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality and morbidity, and all outcomes were adjudicated by an in-country team of clinicians. Maternal death and morbidity were assessed during pregnancy or within 42 days after pregnancy; morbidity was defined as one or more life-threatening pregnancy complications (a serious end-organ complication of pre-eclampsia [ie, eclampsia, stroke, coma, antepartum haemorrhage, or disseminated intravascular coagulation], another major maternal complication [ie, obstetric sepsis, or vesicovaginal or rectovaginal fistula], or receipt of a life-saving intervention [ie, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, blood transfusion, interventions for major post-partum haemorrhage, or dialysis]). This analysis also included a maternal CNS composite outcome of one or more of maternal eclampsia, stroke, coma, or mortality. Fetal or neonatal death included stillbirth, early neonatal mortality, or late neonatal mortality (appendix p 4).In this analysis, we included CLIP trial participants who were from intervention groups and had at least one POM app-guided antenatal contact with blood pressure measurement done by community health workers at a clinically estimated gestation of 44 weeks or less. Analyses including post-partum and perinatal outcomes were restricted to women who had delivered and provided outcome information.We classified the antenatal blood pressure readings for each woman at each visit, on the basis of the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association criteria,2Whelton PK Carey RM Aronow WS et al.2017 ACC/AHA/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/AGS/APhA/ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation, and management of high blood pressure in adults: executive summary: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines.Hypertension. 2018; 71: 1269-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2189) Google Scholar as: normal blood pressure (sBP <120 mm Hg and dBP <80 mm Hg), elevated blood pressure (sBP 120–129 mm Hg and dBP <80 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (sBP 130–139 mm Hg or dBP 80–89 mm Hg, or both), non-severe stage 2 hypertension (sBP 140–159 mm Hg or dBP 90–109 mm Hg, or both), and severe stage 2 hypertension (sBP ≥160 mm Hg or dBP ≥110 mm Hg, or both). We classified women according to the maximum blood pressure category reached across all visits for the primary analyses. Women who were hypertensive before 20 weeks of gestation were regarded as having chronic hypertension, and those who were hypertensive at 20 weeks of gestation or greater were regarded as having gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia.12Brown MA Magee LA Kenny LC et al.Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy: ISSHP classification, diagnosis, and management recommendations for international practice.Hypertension. 2018; 72: 24-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google ScholarStatistical analysisDescriptive statistics were used to summarise baseline maternal characteristics, and maximal blood pressure categories overall and according to gestational age at measurement (<20 weeks vs ≥20 weeks).The possible dose-response relationship between blood pressure category and adverse outcomes was assessed in two ways. First, we treated each category as mutually exclusive and calculated the risk ratio (RR) between normal blood pressure and each category, using generalised estimating equations with a Poisson link function.13Zou GY Donner A Extension of the modified Poisson regression model to prospective studies with correlated binary data.Stat Methods Med Res. 2013; 22: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar Second, we fit analogous models, but treated the lower limit of each category as a blood pressure cutoff for diagnosis of hypertension. For example, for stage 1 hypertension, we compared women with sBP 130 mm Hg or greater or dBP 80 mm Hg or greater (or both), with those who had sBP less than 130 mm Hg and dBP less than 80 mm Hg. All models were adjusted for maternal age, maternal basic level of education (ie, ≥8 years of schooling in India, attainment of at least grade 5 in Mozambique, or ≥5 years of schooling in Pakistan), gestational age at enrolment, and nulliparity. SEs were based on the sandwich estimator to account for clustering.The diagnostic test properties of blood pressure categories were assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios (LRs). Positive LR was calculated as: sensitivity / (1 – specificity). Negative LR was calculated as: (1 – sensitivity) / specificity. CIs were calculated by standard methods.14Deeks JJ Altman DG Diagnostic tests 4: likelihood ratios.BMJ. 2004; 329: 168-169Crossref PubMed Google Scholar For each calculation, women with blood pressure equal to or higher than the given blood pressure threshold were compared with those with blood pressure lower than the threshold. LRs describe the likelihood that a given test result would alter the probability of a diagnosis; positive LR values were interpreted as good if greater than or equal to 5·0 and negative LR values were interpreted as good if less than 0·2.In a sensitivity analysis to determine if the sensitivity of blood pressure categories for adverse outcomes improved closer to term, we re-classified women according to the maximum blood pressure category reached within predefined gestational age categories (28 weeks to <32 weeks, 32 weeks to <37 weeks, and ≥37 weeks of gestation). Also, we estimated the optimal sBP and dBP cutoffs to maximise sensitivity of blood pressure for fixed false-positive rates of 5%, 10%, and 20%. All analyses were done using R version 4.0.2.15R Core TeamR: a language and environment for statistical computing. R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna2020Google ScholarRole of the funding sourceThe funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report.ResultsBetween Nov 1, 2014, and Feb 28, 2017, 21 069 women (6067 in India, 4163 in Mozambique, and 10 839 in Pakistan) contributed 103 679 blood pressure measurements across the three CLIP trials (table 1). Most women were aged in their mid-20s, had less than a basic level of education, and were parous. In general, women were enrolled in CLIP late in the first trimester or early in the second trimester, with most enrolling at less than 20 weeks of gestation. About two-thirds of women had normal blood pressure throughout pregnancy. Slightly more than one-quarter of women had abnormal blood pressure classified as elevated blood pressure (2196 [10·4%] of 21 069) or non-severe stage 1 hypertension (3751 [17·8%]). Stage 2 hypertension (non-severe or severe) occurred in 1342 (6·4%) of 21 069 women. Most women delivered at term, but one-quarter delivered preterm. Another quarter suffered a maternal, fetal, or neonatal complication, which were mostly morbidity for the mother (about one in ten women) or death of the fetus (42 per 1000 livebirths) or neonate (41 per 1000 livebirths). Blood pressure was only 1–2 mmHg higher among women with adverse outcomes than in women without adverse outcomes (appendix p 5).Table 1Baseline characteristics Participants (n=21 069)CountryIndia6067 (28·8%)Mozambique4163 (19·8%)Pakistan10 839 (51·4%)Maternal age, years25·0 (22·0–30·0)Maternal basic level of education*Basic level of education was defined as at least 8 years of schooling in India, at least attainment of grade 5 in Mozambique, or at least 5 years of schooling in Pakistan.8409 (39·9%)Gestational age at enrolment, weeks17·1 (11·2–24·1)Enrolment at ≥20 weeks of gestation7832 (37·2%)Parous15 099 (71·7%)Blood pressure, mm HgMean sBP106·0 (100·4–112·0)Mean dBP66·6 (62·5–71·0)Maximum sBP113·0 (106·0–120·0)Maximum dBP73·0 (67·0–79·0)Maximal blood pressure category†Blood pressure was categorised as: normal blood pressure (sBP <120 mm Hg and dBP <80 mm Hg), elevated blood pressure (sBP 120–129 mm Hg and dBP <80 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (sBP 130–139 mm Hg or dBP 80–89 mm Hg, or both), non-severe stage 2 hypertension (sBP 140–159 mm Hg or dBP 90–109 mm Hg, or both), or severe stage 2 hypertension (sBP ≥160 mm Hg or dBP ≥110 mm Hg, or both).Normal blood pressure13 780 (65·4%)Elevated blood pressure2196 (10·4%)Stage 1 hypertension3751 (17·8%)Non-severe stage 2 hypertension1178 (5·6%)Severe stage 2 hypertension164 (0·8%)Gestational age at delivery, weeks39·0 (37·0–40·4)Preterm delivery (<37 weeks of gestation)4651 (22·1%)Outcomes‡The primary CLIP composite outcome was a composite of maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity.

Open table in a new tab Blood pressure values overall were stable, without a clinically important mid-trimester decrease, until about 30 weeks of gestation, after which both sBP and dBP increased with advancing gestational age (figure 1). Maximal blood pressure values classified as elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension (non-severe or severe) were more common with advancing gestational age (figure 2). Blood pressure in most women remained at the same category or decreased after 20 weeks of gestation or longer, regardless of whether blood pressure at less than 20 weeks of gestation was classified as normal blood pressure (5160 [63·0%] of 8194 women), elevated blood pressure (336 [60·8%] of 552), stage 1 hypertension (527 [75·7%] of 696), or non-severe stage 2 hypertension (91 [75·8%] of 120; table 2). If the stage 1 hypertension category cutoffs were used as the new threshold for diagnosing hypertension in pregnancy, an additional 1681 (17·5%) of 9574 women would be diagnosed; if elevated blood pressure category cutoffs were used, an additional 1021 (10·7%) of women would be diagnosed (table 2).Figure 1Maximal blood pressure measurements by gestational ageShow full captionMaximal blood pressure values per woman are shown, as a median with IQR for each gestational age week.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 2Maximal blood pressure measurements as blood pressure categories by gestational ageShow full captionA log-scale is used for the y-axis (number of women) for clarity.

Open table in a new tab There was a dose-response relationship between higher blood pressure category and greater RR for adverse outcomes compared with normal blood pressure, for most outcomes with non-severe stage 2 hypertension and for all outcomes with severe stage 2 hypertension, which increased risk by at least two times and up to six times (table 3). When the diagnostic criteria for each blood pressure category were used as a threshold for diagnosis of an abnormal blood pressure, the risk of all adverse outcomes, other than the maternal composite, increased from elevated blood pressure onwards; however, the point estimates for elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, and non-severe stage 2 hypertension were consistently higher than they were when these blood pressure categories were each compared with normal blood pressure, and RRs were less than 2·00 for all but non-severe stage 2 hypertension and stillbirth.Table 3Adjusted RRs for blood pressure categories and adverse outcomes Normal blood pressureElevated blood pressureStage 1 hypertensionNon-severe stage 2 hypertensionSevere stage 2 hypertensionComparison with normal blood pressure categoryCLIP composite1 (ref)0·99 (0·94–1·03)1·08 (1·00–1·16)*Unrounded lower limit of 95% CI is 1·002.†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·29 (1·13–1·47)†95% CI does not overlap 1.2·48 (2·06–2·98)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Maternal composite1 (ref)1·02 (0·89–1·17)1·11 (0·93–1·33)1·20 (0·90–1·59)2·40 (1·60–3·59)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Maternal CNS composite1 (ref)0·98 (0·63–1·51)1·26 (0·91–1·75)1·46 (1·00–2·13)†95% CI does not overlap 1.6·05 (3·88–9·46)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Fetal or neonatal death1 (ref)0·93 (0·79–1·09)1·15 (0·96–1·38)1·48 (1·10–1·97)†95% CI does not overlap 1.4·09 (3·02–5·55)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Stillbirth1 (ref)0·98 (0·74–1·29)1·24 (0·97–1·58)1·81 (1·30–2·54)†95% CI does not overlap 1.5·88 (3·95–8·73)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Comparison of blood pressure category and all higher categories, with all lower blood pressure categories‡For example, for stage 1 hypertension, the comparison is for all women with sBP 130 mm Hg or greater or dBP 80 mm Hg or greater, or both, versus all women with sBP <130 mm Hg and dBP <80 mm Hg; the exception to this approach was for the normal blood pressure category which was compared with all higher blood pressure categories.CLIP composite..1·12 (1·05–1·19)†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·17 (1·09–1·26)†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·41 (1·24–1·60)†95% CI does not overlap 1.2·40 (2·02–2·86)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Maternal composite..1·13 (0·96–1·33)1·17 (0·98–1·40)1·32 (1·05–1·65)†95% CI does not overlap 1.2·32 (1·58–3·39)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Maternal CNS composite..1·32 (1·08–1·61)†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·47 (1·13–1·90)†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·91 (1·41–2·57)†95% CI does not overlap 1.5·64 (3·73–8·52)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Fetal or neonatal death..1·20 (1·02–1·43)†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·33 (1·12–1·58)†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·75 (1·42–2·15)†95% CI does not overlap 1.3·90 (2·96–5·13)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Stillbirth..1·36 (1·09–1·70)†95% CI does not overlap 1.1·52 (1·24–1·87)†95% CI does not overlap 1.2·19 (1·72–2·79)†95% CI does not overlap 1.5·38 (3·80–7·61)†95% CI does not overlap 1.Data are RR (95% CI).

Open table in a new tab In sensitivity analyses restricted to blood pressure measurements in specific gestational age ranges within the third trimester, sensitivity remained low for all blood pressure categories, including the elevated blood pressure category, although sensitivity was slightly higher for measurements from 32 weeks to less than 37 weeks (appendix p 8). Also, sensitivity remained low (<20%) for optimal sBP (123–136 mm Hg) and dBP (81–104 mm Hg) cutoffs, for fixed false-positive rates of 5%, 10%, and 20% (appendix p 6).DiscussionIn the CLIP trial clusters in low-resource settings, women classified as having elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension did not have an increased risk of adverse maternal, fetal, or neonatal outcomes compared with women with normal blood pressure (<120/80 mm Hg). Risk of adverse outcomes was increased with stage 2 hypertension, particularly with severe stage 2 hypertension, which was associated with a two to six times increased risk compared with normal blood pressure. When blood pressure categories higher than normal were used as diagnostic cutoffs for abnormal blood pressure (how 140/90 mm Hg is currently used), the risk of adverse outcomes was increased; however, this increase was driven by the risks associated with severe stage 2 hypertension. In addition, sensitivities for adverse outcomes were low (<45%), and no category other than severe stage 2 hypertension showed useful diagnostic test properties. Using optimal cutpoint analyses for false-positive rates considered clinically reasonable led to poor sensitivity (<30%) for all outcomes.If elevated blood pressure was used as a diagnostic cutoff, an additional 28% of women would be labelled as having an abnormal blood pressure; if stage 1 hypertension was used, this would be an additional 11% of women, in addition to women already identified as having hypertension by current criteria (ie, stage 2 hypertension in this study). In our study population, the prevalence of hypertension was previously found to be 14·0% in India, 16·8% in Mozambique, and 11·6% in Pakistan, after inclusion of hypertensive diagnoses from household survey and facility records.16Magee LA Sharma S Nathan HL et al.The incidence of pregnancy hypertension in India, Pakistan, Mozambique, and Nigeria: a prospective population-level analysis.PLoS Med. 2019; 16e1002783Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar Therefore, an additional 28% or 11% of women with diagnoses of hypertension (depending on the cutoff used) would substantially increase the burden on health systems under stress, and could be justified only by the ability to identify women and babies at risk.To our knowledge, this is the first study to report on the diagnostic properties of using revised blood pressure thresholds for the diagnosis of hypertension in pregnancy, and the first to report on outcomes by specific blood pressure thresholds for women in under-resourced settings.Numerous studies have reported that women with antenatal elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension by American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association criteria, as used in our analyses, have an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes;3Sisti G Williams B Body of evidence in favor of adopting 130/80 mm Hg as new blood pressure cut-off for all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.Medicina (Kaunas). 2019; 55: 703Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 4Reddy M Rolnik DL Harris K et al.Challenging the definition of hypertension in pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 222: 606Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Greenberg VR Lundsberg LS Culhane JF et al.143: Is stage 1 hypertension prior to 20 weeks gestation associated with adverse perinatal outcomes?.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 222: S106-S107Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18González-Valencia DP Valero-Rubio SY Fernando Grillo-Ardila C Prehypertension as a risk factor for the development of perinatal complications: retrospective cohort study.Pregnancy Hypertens. 2020; 21: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 19Wu DD Gao L Huang O et al.Increased adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with stage 1 hypertension in a low-risk cohort: evidence from 47 874 cases.Hypertension. 2020; 75: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar these included pre-eclampsia and other outcomes (eg, hospitalisation) not reported in our study.

Furthermore, we had fewer baseline characteristics with which to adjust our RRs compared with other studies,4Reddy M Rolnik DL Harris K et al.Challenging the definition of hypertension in pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 222: 606Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Greenberg VR Lundsberg LS Culhane JF et al.143: Is stage 1 hypertension prior to 20 weeks gestation associated with adverse perinatal outcomes?.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 222: S106-S107Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18González-Valencia DP Valero-Rubio SY Fernando Grillo-Ardila C Prehypertension as a risk factor for the development of perinatal complications: retrospective cohort study.Pregnancy Hypertens. 2020; 21: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 19Wu DD Gao L Huang O et al.Increased adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with stage 1 hypertension in a low-risk cohort: evidence from 47 874 cases.Hypertension. 2020; 75: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Hu J Li Y Zhang B et al.Impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline for high blood pressure on evaluating gestational hypertension-associated risks for newborns and mothers.Circ Res. 2019; 125: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar and we studied unselected pregnant women, not just those who were nulliparous21Hauspurg A Sutton EF Catov JM Caritis SN Aspirin effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with stage 1 hypertension in a high-risk cohort.Hypertension. 2018; 72: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Sutton EF Hauspurg A Caritis SN Powers RW Catov JM Maternal outcomes associated with lower range stage 1 hypertension.Obstet Gynecol. 2018; 132: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar or primarily nulliparous.23Fukushima K Morokuma S Tsukimori K Murata M Wake N Blood pressure measurements within the JNC7 pre-hypertensive range after 32 weeks of gestation are a risk factor for decreased fetal growth.Hypertens Res. 2012; 35: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar Alternatively, the differences in RRs might have been due to methodology. Our data collection was prospective and blood pressure measurement was standardised, using a device validated for pregnancy and pre-eclampsia.11Nathan HL de Greeff A Hezelgrave NL Chappell LC Shennan AH An accurate semiautomated oscillometric blood pressure device for use in pregnancy (including pre-eclampsia) in a low-income and middle-income country population: the Microlife 3AS1-2.Blood Press Monit. 2015; 20: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar By contrast, most published data have been retrospective and from large urban referral centres with blood pressure measurements from routine clinical care.4Reddy M Rolnik DL Harris K et al.Challenging the definition of hypertension in pregnancy: a retrospective cohort study.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 222: 606Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 17Greenberg VR Lundsberg LS Culhane JF et al.143: Is stage 1 hypertension prior to 20 weeks gestation associated with adverse perinatal outcomes?.Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2020; 222: S106-S107Summary Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 18González-Valencia DP Valero-Rubio SY Fernando Grillo-Ardila C Prehypertension as a risk factor for the development of perinatal complications: retrospective cohort study.Pregnancy Hypertens. 2020; 21: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 19Wu DD Gao L Huang O et al.Increased adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with stage 1 hypertension in a low-risk cohort: evidence from 47 874 cases.Hypertension. 2020; 75: 772-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Hu J Li Y Zhang B et al.Impact of the 2017 ACC/AHA guideline for high blood pressure on evaluating gestational hypertension-associated risks for newborns and mothers.Circ Res. 2019; 125: 184-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 23Fukushima K Morokuma S Tsukimori K Murata M Wake N Blood pressure measurements within the JNC7 pre-hypertensive range after 32 weeks of gestation are a risk factor for decreased fetal growth.Hypertens Res. 2012; 35: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar One prospective study restricted blood pressure observations to women at less than 20 weeks of gestation,21Hauspurg A Sutton EF Catov JM Caritis SN Aspirin effect on adverse pregnancy outcomes associated with stage 1 hypertension in a high-risk cohort.Hypertension. 2018; 72: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22Sutton EF Hauspurg A Caritis SN Powers RW Catov JM Maternal outcomes associated with lower range stage 1 hypertension.Obstet Gynecol. 2018; 132: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar by contrast to our blood pressure measurements that were done throughout pregnancy, the majority of which were done after 20 weeks of gestation. One prospective study in South Africa reported that, among 1116 women, an additional 37·1% would be classified as having abnormal blood pressure by the American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association criteria; although pregnancy outcomes were not reported separately for these women compared with those with stage 2 hypertension,24Bengtson AM Phillips TK le Roux SM et al.High blood pressure at entry into antenatal care and birth outcomes among a cohort of HIV-uninfected women and women living with HIV initiating antiretroviral therapy in South Africa.Pregnancy Hypertens. 2021; 23: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar it has been reported among pregnant teenagers in the same setting that eclampsia might follow antenatal blood pressure values of less than 140/90 mm Hg.25Moodley J Ngene NC Maternal deaths due to eclampsia in teenagers: lessons from assessment of maternal deaths in South Africa.Afr J Prim Health Care Fam Med. 2020; 12: e1-e6Crossref Google ScholarImportantly, none of the aforementioned studies have reported the diagnostic test properties of various blood pressure categories to define abnormal blood pressure in pregnancy. As blood pressure measurement in pregnancy is a screening test, it should have high sensitivity for the adverse outcomes of interest, which can then lead to the established therapeutic care pathways for hypertension in pregnancy. However, blood pressure measurement is not sensitive, whether American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association categories are used (even elevated blood pressure) or an optimal blood pressure cutoff is estimated from the data and chosen. Perhaps this poor sensitivity is unsurprising, as the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of three leading causes of adverse maternal outcomes (along with obstetric haemorrhage and sepsis), including spontaneous preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and intrapartum complications for fetal or neonatal outcomes,26Kassebaum NJ Barber RM Bhutta ZA et al.Global, regional, and national levels of maternal mortality, 1990–2015: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015.Lancet. 2016; 388: 1775-1812Summary Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar and these other conditions could not be predicted by abnormal blood pressure. Nevertheless, although blood pressure measurement is regarded by WHO as good clinical practice that does not require evidence review,27WHOWHO recommendations on antenatal care for a positive pregnancy experience.https://www.who.int/publications-detail-redirect/9789241549912Date: May 3, 2017Date accessed: January 8, 2021Google Scholar measurement is but one part of quality antenatal care and when normal, might provide minimal reassurance that adverse outcomes are less likely to occur.The one blood pressure category that was useful in identifying women at increased risk of adverse outcomes (ie, maternal CNS outcomes and fetal or neonatal death) was severe stage 2 hypertension. This finding endorses severe stage 2 hypertension as a condition that should be avoided, as have previous data from well resourced settings,28Magee LA von Dadelszen P Singer J et al.The CHIPS randomized controlled trial (Control of Hypertension In Pregnancy Study): is severe hypertension just an elevated blood pressure?.Hypertension. 2016; 68: 1153-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar by contrast to regarding severe hypertension as a condition that can be treated if it occurs.29Magee LA von Dadelszen P Rey E et al.Less-tight versus tight control of hypertension in pregnancy.N Engl J Med. 2015; 372: 407-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google ScholarOur study has several strengths, including our large sample size, community-based recruitment of unselected pregnant women in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and the standardisation of blood pressure readings across the sample, using a pregnancy-validated device.11Nathan HL de Greeff A Hezelgrave NL Chappell LC Shennan AH An accurate semiautomated oscillometric blood pressure device for use in pregnancy (including pre-eclampsia) in a low-income and middle-income country population: the Microlife 3AS1-2.Blood Press Monit. 2015; 20: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar These factors help to provide evidence for hypertension diagnostic thresholds that is applicable to a large set of pregnant women in these settings.This study has several limitations. First, many women in Pakistan and Mozambique were enrolled after 20 weeks of gestation, consistent with timing of booking for antenatal care in these settings; therefore, a diagnosis of chronic hypertension could not be evaluated when blood pressure was measured after 20 weeks of gestation. Second, only basic maternal characteristics were available for our adjusted analyses. Third, many women did not have weekly blood pressure measurements from 36 weeks of gestation to delivery as specified in the CLIP protocol, so although the household survey and facility records ultimately informed diagnoses of hypertension, we did not have all relevant blood pressure values for this analysis, particularly from close to term. Women with stage 2 hypertension, whether severe or non-severe, were referred to facilities for antihypertensive treatment (about which we have no further information) and facility care; although not the focus of our analyses, such management is likely to have attenuated the relationship between stage 2 hypertension and outcomes and overestimated the strength of association between lower levels of blood pressure and adverse outcomes. Finally, we did not include in our analysis the outcome of pre-eclampsia given our community setting, and so could not evaluate this as an outcome with the revised hypertension definitions embedded in it.Pregnant women in under-resourced settings with higher-than-normal blood pressure are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, due to the risks associated with blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, particularly with severe stage 2 hypertension. No antenatal blood pressure threshold is sensitive with regards to the adverse maternal, fetal, or neonatal outcomes studied, including data-driven cutoffs. However, the occurrence of severe stage 2 hypertension (≥160/110 mm Hg) is associated with a substantially increased risk of adverse maternal CNS outcomes and fetal or neonatal death, particularly stillbirth, and should be treated as per international guidance.30WHOWHO recommendations for prevention and treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/maternal_perinatal_health/9789241548335/en/Date: 2011Date accessed: January 8, 2021Google Scholar Antenatal care must aim to provide more than accurate blood pressure measurement to achieve the Countdown 2030 goals.This online publication has been corrected.
