The management of women with these complications has changed with the introduction of dedicated Early Pregnancy Units, with a shift away from a surgical approach to one based on an expectant or ‘watch and wait’ policy.This chapter describes the role of transvaginal sonography (TVS) in the management of these women and critically evaluates the different treatment modalities available for the management of these complications. The management of miscarriage has largely changed from a surgical to an expectant or medical approach. The treatment of ectopic pregnancy (EP) is also being managed in a similar way as the condition is increasingly detected earlier. We will argue that EP should not be diagnosed on the basis of the absence of an intrauterine pregnancy but rather by the positive visualization of an adnexal mass using TVS. If a pregnancy cannot be seen either inside or outside the uterus this should be described as a pregnancy of unknown location and managed expectantly until the outcome is confirmed.Section snippetsThe role of expectant management in miscarriageNeilsen and Hahlin5, in a randomized prospective trial, demonstrated expectant management alone to be as effective as surgical evacuation of the uterus in women with an incomplete miscarriage. The complication rate (as measured by the development of anaemia or the number of infections) was only 3% in the expectant group compared to 11% in the surgical group. The duration of bleeding in the expectant group was 1.3 days longer (P<0.02); however, there was no difference in packed cell volume orMedical management of miscarriageThe use of prostaglandin analogues (misoprostol or gemeprost) and anti-progesterone priming (mifepristone) for the medical management of miscarriage is well described.19., 20., 21., 22., 23., 24., 25. Quoted success rates vary widely in the literature from 13 to 96%. The outcome depends not only on the type of miscarriage treated but also on the criteria used for follow-up. The total dose of prostaglandin, route of administration and its duration of use alter the outcome. Higher success ratesSurgical management of miscarriageDespite a shift towards medical and expectant management of first-trimester miscarriage, 88% of women who miscarry in the United Kingdom still undergo surgical evacuation. Surgical evacuation of retained products of conception can be performed using sharp curettage or vacuum aspiration. There will always be a role for surgical evacuation of the uterus, especially when a woman is haemodynamically compromised or has an infective miscarriage.In a meta-analysis of surgical procedures adopted in the Ectopic pregnancyOver the last 25 years, as the morbidity and associated mortality of EP have substantially decreased, the incidence has progressively increased. The fourth leading cause of direct maternal deaths in the UK is EP, accounting for 80% of first-trimester deaths.32 With the advent of EPUs, the number of stable ectopic pregnancies diagnosed has significantly increased and consequently treatment modalities have become less radical. The evolution of treatment has progressed from salpingectomy at theThe role of expectant management in ectopic pregnancyIn a select group of women, expectant management of EP is an option. Ylostalo et al39 managed 15% of their EPs expectantly and observed spontaneous resolution in 64.6%. Follow-up for these women involved ultrasound scans and measurements of serial serum hCG titres until they have fallen to <15 IU/l. Inclusion criteria stipulated that the patient had to be stable, compliant, and with no evidence of haemoperitoneum on TVS or other signs of tubal rupture.In a study of 118 women selected forMedical management of tubal ectopic pregnancyMedical treatment of EP with methotrexate is successful in 71–100% of cases.42 Successful outcome depends on the initial serum hCG levels (the likelihood of treatment failure is greater at higher serum hCG concentrations), the size of the EP on TVS and the presence or absence of fetal heart activity. In the United Kingdom, 50 mg/m2 methotrexate is administered intramuscularly on day 1. A second dose of methotrexate is required in up to 13% of cases if the hCG levels do not fall by 15% betweenSurgical management of tubal ectopic pregnancyThe laparoscopic approach has been conclusively shown to be better than laparotomy in the management of EP.52., 53., 54. Laparoscopy is equally as effective as open surgery in the treatment of tubal pregnancy55, and reduces costs considerably.56 The laparoscopic approach results in less haemorrhage and less pain; it is associated with a shorter hospital stay and recovery time. Nevertheless, there will always be a place for laparotomy in those women who are haemodynamically unstable.There is noNon-tubal ectopic pregnanciesEctopic pregnancies are classified according to their site of implantation. Non-tubal ectopic pregnancies account for only 5% of EPs, but they contribute a disproportionate number of serious complications. Their diagnosis may be difficult and they are associated with significant haemorrhage leading to a higher morbidity and mortality than tubal EPs.Interstitial pregnancies account for about 2% of EPs.61 The sonographic appearance of the interstitial pregnancy is that of a bulge in the cornualPregnancy of unknown locationIn 8–31% of women who present to an EPU, the pregnancy site will not be visualized by TVS.71., 72. These women are classified as having a ‘PUL’. This is a descriptive term rather than a pathological entity. The varying prevalence may be attributable to the sonographer's ability. An inexperienced sonographer could potentially overlook some early intrauterine gestational sacs or adnexal masses, which, in turn, would result in a higher prevalence of PUL for a given EPU.PUL is defined by TVS asThe discriminatory zone and serial monitoring of serum hormonal levelsWhen the location of a pregnancy cannot be confirmed on the basis of an ultrasound scan, the levels of serum hCG and progesterone and their interpretation should determine the management. An understanding of the pattern of serum hCG levels in early normal pregnancy, and the correlation between low serum progesterone levels and the spontaneous resolution of a pregnancy, are important hormonal variables in the management of pregnancies of unknown location. However, laparoscopy is still performedPersisting pregnancies of unknown locationTo date there are no published data relating to persisting PUL. This small subset of women are defined as those in whom the serum hCG levels fail to decline, where there is no evidence of trophoblast disease, and the location of the pregnancy cannot be identified whether by ultrasound or laparoscopy. In general, the serum hCG levels are low (<500 IU/l) and have reached a plateau. We have treated nine such women successfully with methotrexate 50 mg/m2 and their serum hCG levels subsequentlyAdnexal masses in early pregnancyThe incidence of adnexal pathology detected in the first trimester is between 0.17 and 2.94%.82., 83. In a study of some 2245 women scanned at the end of the first trimester, 1.2% of the total persisted beyond 16 weeks and subsequently were surgically removed—there were no cases of malignancy.82 In a study of 55 278 pregnancy terminations, there were two cases of ovarian malignancy.83 This is in keeping with the reported frequency of ovarian cancer in pregnancy—one in 15 000 to one in 32 000.84 Hydatidiform moleTVS has led to the early diagnosis of molar pregnancy. Classically, the ‘snow-storm’ effect previously described was historically seen with transabdominal sonography.89 In modern practice, the findings seen on TVS are described as multiple small sonolucent areas (Figure 7), which correspond to the ‘grapelike’ vesicles that one sees on gross pathological examination.90The majority of cases of molar pregnancy (67%) seen in an EPU now present as missed or anembryonic pregnancies sonographically.91 SummaryThere has been a trend towards more conservative management of women with complications in the first trimester of pregnancy. The majority of women presenting with miscarriage can be offered expectant management with a reasonable prospect of success and with no increase in the complication rate; however, in the presence of haemodynamic compromise or infection there will always be a role for surgical evacuation of the uterus.

Two expert radiologists for gynaecological imaging and two inexpert radiologists independently reviewed non-CE MRI and a combination of non-CE and CE-MRI (non-CE+CE-MRI), then determined implantation site with a confidence level. The following MRI features were also evaluated: extrauterine gestational sac (GS)-like structure (shape, signal intensities at T1-weighted imaging [WI], T2WI, and diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI], presence of the three rings appearance, and distinct low intensity areas at T2WI, presence of tree or dot-like components, degree of contrast enhancement), fallopian tube (dilatation, dilatation with haematoma, degree of contrast enhancement, enhanced components within the tube), and ascites. These findings were compared for non-CE and non-CE+CE-MRI data, and for expert and inexpert groups.The expert group identified implantation sites correctly in 58/63 (92%) cases for non-CE and non-CE+CE-MRI. In the inexpert group, the correct identification was improved from 54/63 (86%) using non-CE MRI to 58/63 (92%) using non-CE+CE-MRI, but was not significant (p=0.29). In comparison between non-CE and non-CE+CE-MRI, dilation of the fallopian tubes was observed more frequently (p=0.004) and the confidence level was elevated significantly in the non-CE+CE-MRI (p<0.0001) in the inexpert group. Intergroup comparison revealed that confidence level was significantly higher in the expert group than in the inexpert group using non-CE MRI (p<0.0001), although the difference was not significant at non-CE+CE MRI (p=0.49).CE-MRI did not significantly improve correct identification of ectopic pregnancy implantation sites, although the addition of contrast enhancement did enable inexpert radiologists to diagnose confidently.Emergencies in Early Pregnancy2012, Emergency Medicine Clinics of North AmericaCitation Excerpt :The differential diagnosis is initially broad.

Specific sonographic criteria exist for the diagnosis of tubal and non-tubal pregnancies including cervical and caesarean section scar pregnancies. Diagnosis is based on the visualization of an ectopic mass rather than the inability to visualize an intra-uterine pregnancy.This chapter discusses the specific criteria used for the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy and examines the literature assessing the accuracy of ultrasound as a diagnostic tool.Ectopic pregnancies: current diagnostics and treatment2023, GynakologieUpdate of the confrontation and management of tubal ectopic pregnancy2021, Revista Chilena de Obstetricia y GinecologiaView all citing articles on ScopusView full textCopyright © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
