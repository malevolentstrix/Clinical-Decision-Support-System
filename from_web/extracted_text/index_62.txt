To study the association of preeclampsia with abnormal bleeding in the first trimester and after delivery. Design. Register-based population study. Setting. The Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Population. A total of 315,085 women in Norway with singleton deliveries after 21 weeks of gestation (1999–2004). Methods. We compared frequencies of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester between women who subsequently developed preeclampsia and women without preeclampsia development, and made similar comparisons for postpartum bleeding. Main outcome measures. Proportion of women with bleeding. Results. In the first trimester, vaginal bleeding occurred in 1.6% (215/13,166) of subsequent preeclampsia cases, compared to 2.0% (6,112/301,919) of normotensives (p<0.01). After delivery, excess postpartum bleeding (>1,500 mL) occurred in 3.0% (399/13,166) of preeclampsia cases and in 1.4% (4,223/301,919) of normotensives (p<0.01). Moderate bleeding postpartum (>500 mL) was also more common in preeclampsia cases (22.9% versus 13.9%, p<0.01). Similar patterns were present in first time mothers and in women with more than one birth, and the patterns did not vary according to type of delivery (cesarean section or not). Conclusions. These results suggest that factors associated with preeclampsia are inversely related to vaginal bleeding early in pregnancy, but positively associated with excess bleeding after delivery. Introduction Angiogenic factors have a critical role in normal vascular development and recent studies have shown that angiogenic factors in maternal circulation are strongly associated with the risk of preeclampsia in pregnancy (1–3). Preeclampsia occurs in 3–5% of all pregnancies world wide and is a major cause for perinatal and maternal morbidity and mortality (4). It is assumed that a hypoxic placenta initiates release of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt-1) that binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placenta growth factor (PlGF) (1), (4–6). This deprives maternal vascular endothelium of essential angiogenic factors and causes systemic endothelial dysfunction that may culminate in the preeclamptic syndrome. Angiogenic factors are also important for the clotting system, including activation of coagulation and vascular thrombosis (7). Despite increasing knowledge, these functions are, however, insufficiently understood. A possible association of angiogenic factors with bleeding is not easy to study in populations since both factors are difficult to measure. Information on abnormal bleeding during and after pregnancy, however, is often collected, and may be used as a measure of increased risk of bleeding. If angiogenic factors are associated with pregnancy bleeding, it is conceivable that preeclampsia is also associated with bleeding due to the strong association of angiogenic factors with preeclampsia. Low levels of sFlt-1 early in pregnancy and high levels late in pregnancy have been associated with increased risk of preeclampsia (2, 5), (6). Based on these observations, the relation of preeclampsia with abnormal bleeding in early pregnancy may differ from the relation with bleeding after delivery. We therefore suggest that preeclampsia is associated with reduced risk of abnormal bleeding in first trimester and increased risk of excessive bleeding after delivery. To examine these possible associations of preeclampsia with bleeding in early pregnancy and after delivery, we used population data from more than 315,000 pregnancies in Norway. Material and methods The study population comprised all singleton pregnancies in Norway from 1999 through 2004 with delivery after the 21st pregnancy week; a total of 315,085 pregnancies. Our data source was the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, which comprises information on all births in the country since 1967 (http://www.uib.no/mfr). Information on pregnancy and delivery is obtained by compulsory notification on standardized forms by midwives. Information related to maternal health before delivery is prospectively collected during prenatal care through standardized national prenatal health records. Since 1999, the standardized reporting includes detailed information on abnormal bleeding during pregnancy and after delivery. Vaginal bleeding before the 13th pregnancy week (yes/no) is routinely registered based on prenatal care recordings, and after delivery, postpartum bleeding within 24 hours after delivery is recorded as bleeding of more than 500 mL (yes/no), or as excessive postpartum bleeding of more than 1,500 mL (yes/no). In the Medical Birth Registry, the recording of preeclampsia is based on the following diagnostic criteria: an increase in blood pressure to at least 140/90 mmHg after the 20th week of pregnancy, alternatively an increase in diastolic blood pressure of at least 15 mmHg, or an increase in systolic blood pressure of at least 30 mmHg compared to the level measured before the 20th week, in addition to presence of proteinuria (protein excretion, dipstick ≥2). Based on these criteria, preeclampsia is routinely entered as a specified diagnosis on the standardized form to the Medical Birth Registry by the midwife or obstetrician in charge at delivery. As preeclampsia, we included pregnancies with a specified diagnosis of preeclampsia and pregnancies with a combination of pregnancy induced hypertension and proteinuria. The study was approved by the Advisory Board of the Medical Birth Registry of Norway, and by the Norwegian Data Inspectorate. The results are presented as proportions of women with bleeding (in first trimester of pregnancy and after delivery) according to preeclampsia status, and differences in proportions were tested with chi-square tests. In sub-analyses, we stratified the women according to cesarean delivery, and we also studied first time mothers separately. All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (version 14.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL). Results Of 315,085 women with singleton pregnancies, 4.2% (13,166) were diagnosed with preeclampsia (Table I). The frequency of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester was lower in women who later developed preeclampsia compared to other women (1.6% versus 2.0%, p<0.005). Table I.

The relation of preeclampsia with bleeding after delivery was opposite that observed for vaginal bleeding early in pregnancy. Hence, postpartum bleeding was more frequent in women with preeclampsia compared to other women, both measured as bleeding of more than 500 mL (22.9% versus 13.9%, p<0.005), and bleeding of more than 1,500 mL (3.0% versus 1.4%, p<0.005), as observed at delivery, including two hours postpartum. In a sub-analysis of women with vaginal deliveries (85% of total), the results corresponded to the findings for the total population (Table I). Among women with cesarean delivery, there was a similar increased risk of excessive postpartum bleeding (more than 1,500 mL) related to preeclampsia (p<0.005). The difference related to moderate bleeding (>500 mL) was, however, not statistically significant. In a separate analysis (Table II), we only included first time mothers (128,114 women; 41% of all pregnancies). Also in these women, the occurrence of abnormal bleeding (in pregnancy and after delivery) associated with preeclampsia was very similar to the observations made for the total study population.

Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet counts (HELLP syndrome) occurred in 0.2% (476/315,085) of all women (data not tabulated). The prevalence of excess postpartum bleeding was similar to that observed in the preeclampsia group as a whole, 4.6% (22/476) had more than 1,500 mL postpartum bleeding, and 28% (137/476) had more than 500 mL postpartum bleeding. Among preeclampsia cases, there was an overrepresentation of abruption of the placenta (1.2% versus 0.4%), although very few women had both conditions in the same pregnancy. Nonetheless, in women with abruption of the placenta, the prevalence of excess (>1,500 mL) postpartum bleeding was relatively high (8.5%). Discussion In this large population study, we found that women who developed preeclampsia had lower frequency of vaginal bleeding during first trimester, but higher frequency of excessive bleeding after delivery compared to other women. The results for the total population were confirmed in sub-analyses of first time mothers, and in women with cesarean or vaginal delivery. Few other studies have investigated the association between preeclampsia and bleeding, and these studies were related to bleeding after delivery. In a study of vaginal deliveries, excessive postpartum bleeding was five times more common in pregnancies with preeclampsia (8). Two other studies were restricted to cesarean deliveries, and in both studies, preeclampsia was associated with about two-fold higher risk of excessive bleeding after delivery (9, 10). In our study, women who subsequently developed preeclampsia had lower risk of bleeding in the first trimester compared to other women. This finding could not be biased due to knowledge of preeclampsia status, since reporting of early bleeding was prospectively recorded on standardized forms by the midwives or doctors who were responsible for prenatal care. On the other hand, if surveillance of postpartum bleeding differs according to preeclampsia status, the accuracy of recording could differ between groups, and postpartum bleeding among preeclamptic women could be overestimated. Since preeclampsia is an important cause of cesarean delivery, and cesarean delivery in itself is associated with excessive bleeding, we stratified the analysis according to type of delivery. This analysis confirmed that excessive bleeding after delivery was associated with preeclampsia, both in women with cesarean section and in women with vaginal delivery. In women with cesarean section, surveillance postpartum should be uniform and not depend on preeclampsia status. Therefore, bias due to differential reporting of bleeding after delivery is not likely to compromise the results of this study. It is possible that particular subgroups of preeclampsia could be more important for postpartum bleeding than others. Among preeclampsia cases with HELLP syndrome, the prevalence of excess postpartum bleeding was similar to the preeclampsia group as a whole. Since these women represent a small proportion of women with preeclampsia, the higher risk of excessive bleeding postpartum could not be attributed to HELLP syndrome. Abruption of the placenta was also associated with both preeclampsia and postpartum bleeding in our data. However, very few women had both conditions, and the increased risk of postpartum bleeding in women with preeclampsia cannot be attributed to abruption of the placenta. In addition, both placenta praevia and rupture of the uterus were associated with postpartum bleeding, but these conditions were not related to preeclampsia risk, and could not have confounded the association of preeclampsia with postpartum bleeding. Among factors that are associated with both preeclampsia and bleeding, angiogenic factors in maternal circulation may be among the more prominent (1–3), (5, 6). Although the biological mechanisms are not known, circulating sFlt-1 may play a crucial role for the hypertension component in preeclampsia, or through binding VEGF and PlGF. The influence of hypertension on postpartum bleeding could be mediated by endothelial dysfunction and lack of vasoconstriction after delivery of the placenta. It is, however, conceivable that angiogenic factors influence the risk of postpartum bleeding independent of hypertension. Angiogenic factors play a role in the clotting system, including activation of coagulation and vascular thrombosis (7). It is well known that thrombophilia is associated with preeclampsia (11), (12), and that preeclampsia is positively associated with later risk of cardiovascular disease (13). Our findings suggest an association between angiogenic factors and postpartum bleeding, and encourage further studies. In the first trimester, we found that vaginal bleeding was more common in women without subsequent preeclampsia. The reason for this is not obvious, but one possibility could be that better placentation and vascularization could lead to more frequent bleeding early in pregnancy of these women compared to women with later preeclampsia. In conclusion, we found that women who later developed preeclampsia had lower frequency of vaginal bleeding in the first trimester compared to other women, but after delivery, their risk of excessive bleeding in women with preeclampsia was greatly increased. We suggest that angiogenic factors in maternal circulation that are both associated with preeclampsia and bleeding could be relevant factors to explain these findings.
