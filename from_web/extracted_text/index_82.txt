Thyroid hormones are essential for fetal brain devel-opment1and heart function2and have underlying effectson several physiological processes, such as energy pro-duction and body temperature regulation.3Normal thy-roid function is essential for the development of thefetus during pregnancy.4Thyroid disorders affect up to4.0% of all pregnancies,5and hypothyroidism is one ofthe most prevalent diseases in pregnancy.5,6Clinical hy-pothyroidism can be present in 0.3% to 0.7% of pregnantwomen,7,8whereas the prevalence of subclinical hypo-thyroidism is 2.0% to 3.0%.9All over the world, the iodine deficiency is the maincause of maternal thyroid insufficiency, and the accu-mulation of sufficient iodine stores is essential to meetthe increased needs of both mother and fetus.10,11Thus,untreated hypothyroidism has been associated with ahigh risk to the fetus and mother. The most frequentlyreported complications are gestational hypertension,low birth weight, postpartum hemorrhage, congenitalmalformations, an increased number of miscarriages,premature birth, placental abruption, fetal growth retarda-tion, and impaired neuropsychological development.12–14The basic prevention for these complications hasconsisted in an adequate and long-term iodine supple-mentation of women of childbearing age prior to be-coming pregnant.12Performing universal screening for hypothyroidismin all pregnant women has been discussed by re-searchers and health care professionals. The AmericanCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, however,has not recommended the universal screening of preg-nant women but rather the screening of only pregnantwomen with a high risk of thyroid dysfunction. TheAmerican Thyroid Association suggested that there isinsufficient evidence to recommend universal screeningof thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH [thyrotropin]) inpregnant women in the first trimester.13,15Vaidya et a l16observed that screening only high-risk pregnant womendid not detect 30% of hypothyroid women.The screening for hypothyroidism has been based onthe monitoring of the serological levels of TSH, freethyroxine (fT4), and anti–thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies (Abs). Also, the clinical manifestationscan be investigated to guide the professional diagnosis.17Approximately 30% of patients with hypothyroidism aresymptomatic presenting variable and nonspecificsymptoms, such as feeling colder, having drier skin, be-ing tired more easily, becoming depressed and forget-ful, and started getting constipated.17,18In pregnantwomen, the laboratory tests must be conducted in thefirst trimester, which is when hypothyroidism is diag-nosed when TSH serum levels are high, and often se-rum fT4levels are low. Some women can presentnormal TSH levels independently of fT4levels, butTPO-Ab positive, indicating the monitoring of TSHand fT4serum levels in the second and third trimesters.Primarily in the first trimester, TSH and fT4serumlevels and TPO-Ab must be monitored, and if the diag-nosis is hypothyroidism, the treatment should be startedas soon as possible, because maintaining euthyroidismis essential to avoid pregnancy complications.18,19The diagnosis of maternal hypothyroidism must beevaluated during pregnancy,20and the classic treat-ment is oral hormone replacement with levothyroxine(L-T4).21However, there is disagreement about howbest to manage the dose of L-T4during pregnancy becauseno consensus has been reached with regard to increasingthe L-T4dose.22The benefits of treating gestational hy-pothyroidism are numerous, but such treatment can stillresult in complications. Thus, considering the compli-cations that can occur during pregnancy because of un-treated hypothyroidism and reports that hypothyroidismtreatment may cause maternal and fetal complications,the present study identified and analyzed original pub-lished research articles related to pregnancy complicationsassociated with treated and untreated hypothyroidismduring pregnancy. The essential points of the present re-view were that maternal-fetal complications can be as-sociated with abnormal serum hormone levels andthyroid dysfunctions in women with hypothyroidism,regardless of whether it is clinical or subclinical.MATERIALS AND METHODSTo develop thepresent systematic review, we used thePRISMA method.23The PRISMA checklist can be seen inthe Supplemental Digital Content (S4 PRISMA checklist,http://links.lww.com/OBGYNSURV/A29). We searchedthe PubMed database (US National Library of Medicine).We used the search terms “pregnancy complications”and“hypothyroidism”as Medical Subject Headings. In thisstage of the study, the researchers independently con-ducted several searches in the database to identify theterms that would enable the accurate identification ofthe largest number of publications of interest. After nu-merous simulations, the researchers gathered and de-fined by consensus the most suitable search descriptors.We included articles that were published from January1, 2002, to December 31, 2013. The articles that wereconsidered for this review were published in Spanish,Portuguese, or English and had summaries available.Review articles, case reports, editorials, errata, inter-views, guidelines, and animal studies were excluded.Six researchers who belonged to group I (J.J.V.T.,D.R.S., H.C.C., T.S.S., R.O.S., and L.C.B.L.) indepen-dently searched for the relevant abstracts in PubMed.220 Obstetrical and Gynecological SurveyCopyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. The first stage of study selection was to search for po-tential publications, which was performed by readingthe titles and abstracts and excluding those that didnot follow the established selection criteria. The articleswere distributed independently and randomly to the re-viewers. By consensus, they considered the articlesin which 4 or more researchers agreed about inclusionin the study. The articles in which 2 or 3 researchersagreed were classified as indeterminate (concordanceof 33.3%–50%). Articles that were selected by only 1researcher or no researchers were not considered byconsensus and were excluded from the study. In the sec-ond stage, 2 reviewers (I.G.D. and D.R.S.) assessed thefull articles (downloaded as a PDF file) that were se-lected in the first stage (definitive and indeterminate).In the third stage, the selected publications were ran-domly distributed and sent to 3 independent judges whocomprised group II (I.G.D., S.M.A.A., and L.S.A.G.).This group decided which articles that were indicatedby the initial researchers should remain in the system-atic review.The quality and risk of bias of each study wereassessed independently by 2 researchers. Any differ-ences of opinion regarding the risk of bias were re-solved by discussion. The articles were evaluated withregard to data analysis, sample selection, laboratory di-agnosis, and reported treatment. Concerning bias, thearticles were evaluated for limitations that were men-tioned by the included articles' authors themselves andas detected by the reviewers.The characteristics that were collected in each studywere the following: author, year of publication, country,objective, total number of subjects, number of patientswith hypothyroidism, treatment, complications, andconclusions. First, the articles and tables were randomlydistributed to 3 researchers (D.R.S., T.S.S., and H.C.C.)who independently extracted the relevant characteris-tics from the articles and included them in tables. Sec-ond, the judges in group II independently reviewedthe tables and suggested corrections. Afterward, eachjudge independently gave the information assignedin the tables to the other judge. In the third stage,the judges made a correction of the tables' informationin pairs by consensus.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe search strategy identified 359 publications, and18 articles were selected and included in this systematicreview (Fig. 1). The articles were published on 4 conti-nents: North America (United States), South America(Argentina), Europe (United Kingdom, Russia, Serbia,Netherlands, Switzerland, Greece, Sweden, and Italy),and Asia (Israel and Iran). Eighteen analytical studies per-formed statistical analyses, 8 studies were retrospective,24–307 studies were prospective,20,30–352 studies had retrospec-tive cohort designs,36,37and 2 studies did not disclosethe study design.38,39Considering the 18 articles that were included, the totalsample ranged between 16 and 20,499 patients, for a totalof 54,958 participants (Table 1). The patient samples withhypothyroidism ranged from 8 to 742, for a total of 2942individuals with hypothyroidism (women and/or children;Table 2). In addition to hypothyroidism, other condi-tions were also investigated in pregnant women, includ-ing hyperthyroidism,14,25,27,32,41Graves disease,14,25,27,31Hashimoto disease,25,31chronic hypertension,26thyroidcarcinoma,31multinodular goiter,27and thyroid nodules.31The high prevalence of thyroid disease and its associ-ation with adverse pregnancy outcomes worldwide high-light the important role of maternal thyroid dysfunction infetal development.7The prevalence of thyroid dysfunc-tion increases in pregnant women with obstetric or medi-cal complications.33,43For these reasons, it is important toavoid complications that are associated with hypothyroid-ism to investigate hypothyroidism in women beforepregnancy, during pregnancy, and after delivery.27,36Most of the studies (17/18) described the personalcharacteristics of the participants. The average age ofpregnant women with hypothyroidism was 31 yearsold, ranging from 16 to 46 years. The literature showsthat women who are older than 30 years have increasedsusceptibility to such risk factors as chronic diseasesthat influence pregnancies with unfavorable out-comes.34,35The age of the children who were involvedin the studies ranged from birth to 15 years.36,38,39,41The most frequently maternal complications re-lated to hypothyroidism were gestational hyperten-sion (22%)15,26,28,43and preeclampsia (17%).24,26,37Placental abruption, polyhydramnios, and other ma-ternal complications were less reported (Tables 3and 4). Considering fetal complications, 50% ofthe studies reported abortion or intrauterine fetaldeath,14,26–28,31,37,40,42,4333% premature delivery,26–28,31,32,37and 17% low birth weight24,25,37and small for gesta-tional age26,28,37(Tables 3 and 4). Some child com-plications were reported by only 1 or 2 studies, suchas malformation congenital25,26and fetal distress,25and should be carefully interpreted. There is evidencethat hypothyroidism is related to the high incidence ofmaternal and fetus/child complications. Pregnantwomen with untreated hypothyroidism or inade-quately treated hypothyroidism showed a higher riskto the fetus/child presenting undesirable outcomessince its development during the embryonic periodand after birth.221Pregnancy and Maternal Hypothyroidism •CME Review ArticleCopyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The association between hypothyroidism and ges-tational age was investigated by 18 studies, butwith wide variations in amplitude of the pregnancyage between the studies included in this review.The studies reported maternal and infant compli-cations associated with hypothyroidism before,during, and after pregnancy. Of these studies, 4 ex-amined child and maternal complications beforepregnancy,27,31,36,42and4examinedchildandma-ternal complications postpartum24,27,36,38; 55.6% ofthe studies included found no significant associationbetween maternal and fetal complications and hypo-thyroidism (Table 5).24,25,29–32,36,37,42,43Laboratory abnormalities related to thyroid dysfunc-tion were associated with pregnancy complications inmost of the studies, emphasizing the importance ofthe laboratory diagnosis of disease and correct labora-tory findings and ensuring access to adequate maternaland child monitoring to prevent undesirable complica-tions. For diagnosing and monitoring hypothyroidism,the following laboratory tests were performed: serumTSH, fT4, total thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine(fT3), anti-TPO-Ab, antithyroglobulin, plasma protein a,anti-TRAK (antithyrotropin receptor), and ultrasound(Fig. 2). The following tests were performed in thechildren/fetus: visual acuity, ophthalmologic examinationFIG. 1.

Normal TSH levels ranged from0.03 to 5.5 mU/L, and fT4ranged from 0.8 to 2 ng/dL,from 12 to 22 pM, from 9 to 25 pmol/L, or 7 g/dL orgreater, with indices from 5 to 11.14,24,25,27,30–32,36,39,41,43The divergence between the reference values made it diffi-cult to compare the results that were obtained in each study.Notably, no universal standardization has been reached forlaboratory reference values for these tests that are used todiagnose hypothyroidism. We believe that it is unlikely thatstandardization will be achieved, given that referencevalues have been established according to specific loca-tions and populations studied.One of the studies that were included in this reviewreported a direct association between maternal fT4levels during the fifth to ninth week of pregnancy andthe rate of mental development in children aged fromTABLE 2Hypothyroidism Prevalence in Pregnant Women and/or Children and Hypothyroidism TherapyReference Hypothyroidism TreatmentTan et al39419 (2.1%) L-T4: 1st trim: dose adjustment at 20–40%according to TSH and fT4levelsMirabella et al3725 (12 CH children; 13 childrenof mother with Hypo)L-T4: women (dose not related); children(replacement initial dose ~10 μg/kg)Kasatkina et al3830 (25.4%); Pregnancy Hypo:1st trim: 13 (54.2%)/24 women; 3rd trim:17 (48.6%)/35 womenL-T4:averagedailydose1.2μg/kg;iodine: 150–200 μg/dIdris et al24167 (100%); 1st trim: group 1 (n = 40)TSH >5.5 mU/L; group 2 (n = 127)TSH 0.1–5.5 mU/L. 3rd trim:group 3 (n = 44) TSH >2.0 mU/L;group 4 (n = 123) TSH <2.0 mU/LT4: average dose 100 μg(25–275 μg);1st and 3rd trim: 125 μg; 2nd trim: 150 μgAbalovich et al2577 (Group 1: 64 SCH; group 2: 13 OH;one Graves disease)L-T4: group 1-SCH (86.9 ± 25.1 μg/d);group 2-OH (147.1 ± 29.8 μg/d)Ashoor et al40202 (4.5%) Not relatedHenrichs et al41742 (Pregnant: 73 Hypo [1.5%];mild Hypo 413 [8.5%]; severe Hypo:209 [4.3%]); 47 children with Hypo (1.3%)Not relatedWolfberg et al26482 (2.4%) L-T4: dose not relatedAbalovich et al27115 (76%): 52 OH, 62 SCH; 1 HC L-T4: average replacement dose 46.2 ± 29.6 μg/dDe Geyter et al428 (50%) SCH L-T4: SCH (50 μg/d); all participants didsupplementation with AF (0.4 mg)Poulasouchidou et al4392 (100%): 78 (84.8%) primary Hypodiagnosed in early pregnancy;14 (15.2%) during pregnancyL-T4:0–200 μg/dHirsch et al28101 (33%) L-T4:0–2100 μg/wk; dose: 554.78 ± 482.4(0–1850 μg/wk); last dose: 1019.49 ± 394 (350–2100 μg/wk)Hallengren et al1463 (62.4%): 35 autoimmune Hypo,20 Graves disease and 8 other causesL-T4: the dose replacement was from 25 to 50 μgwhen TSH <2 mUI/L during 1st and 2nd trimBehrooz et al3690:19SCH(76%),6OH(24%) L-T4: SCH (118 ± 35 μg/d); control: 109 ± 23 μg/dAbalovich et al29100: OH: 53, SCH: 47 L-T4:50–150 μg/d; time not related; SCH:pregestational (78.3 μg/d); 1st trim (104.9 μg/d);2nd trim (114.1 μg/d); Hypo: pregestational (120.8 μg/d);1st trim (130.6 μg/d); 2nd trim (130.6 μg/d)Alexander et al3119 (100%) L-T4:88–175 μg/d; at 10th wk of pregnancy,the L-T4dose replacement was 29% ± 25%;48% at 20th–38th wkSpremovic-Radjenovic et al3225 (30.1%) L-T4:75–120.8 ± 49.8 μgVerga et al30185 (100%) L-T4: 12.5–50 μg/d (1.1 ± 0.1 μg/kg per day)L-T4dose was increased in 22.9 ± 9.8 μg/d;L-T4(μg/d)/before pregnancy: SH (63.2 ± 20.1);OH (97.2 ± 28.8); PH (108.4 ± 19.6)L-T4(μg/d)/end of pregnancy: SH (101.0 ± 24.6);OH (136.8 ± 30.4); PH (159.0 ± 24.6)AF indicates folic acid; CH, congenital hypothyroidism; Hypo, hypothyroidism; NB, newborn; OH, established hypothyroidism;PH, postablative hypothyroidism; SCH/SH, subclinical hypothyroidism; trim, trimester.224 Obstetrical and Gynecological SurveyCopyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, this study did not investigatethe association between hormone replacement andcomplications.38Henrichs et al41found that both mildand severe maternal hypothyroxinemia was associatedwith an increased risk of expressive language defi-ciency in infancy. Severe maternal hypothyroxinemiawas also associated with an increased risk of nonverbalcognitive retardation in children.41Treatment for hypothyroidism has been recom-mended when TSH, fT4, or TPO-Ab levels are not nor-mal, and management of hypothyroidism has beenconducted based on the classic oral hormone replace-ment, L-T4.44,45Although thyroid hormone replace-ment is the standard of care, other therapies have beenstudied for patients not responding to L-T4monother-apy, as the combination of L-T4/L-T3therapy, L-T3alone, or extracts from animal thyroids. Nonetheless,combined therapy has not been recommended for preg-nant women because of the lack of data showing L-T3can be safely used in pregnancy.44,45The dose of L-T4that is required to maintaineuthyroidism (TSH 0.1–2.5 mIU/L, normal levels) dur-ing pregnancy is still questioned by many health careprofessionals. The dose of L-T4ranges from 0 to300 μg/d according to gestational age and the type of hy-pothyroidism (Table 2). Some authors have suggestedthat the dose of L-T4must be adjusted according togestational age to maintain TSH levels within normallimits (Table 2). In the first trimester of pregnancy,women with TSH levels between 2.5 and 10 mIU/L orgreater than 10 mIU/L and those in the second andthird trimesters with TSH levels between 3.0 and10 mIU/L or greater than 10 mIU/L should receive thetreatment following the protocol for the treatment asindicated (Fig. 3). The L-T4dose could be adjusted tomaintain TSH levels less than 2.5 mIU/L in the firstTABLE 4Maternal and Fetal Complications Reported in the StudiesMost Frequently Reported Complications (≥3 Studies) % Studies Less Frequently Reported (1–2 Studies) % StudiesMaternalGestational hypertension15,26,28, 4322 Placental abruption37,4311Preeclampsia24,26,3717 Polyhydramnios28,4311Oligohydramnios286Hyperemesis436Gestational diabetes mellitus376Premature rupture of membranes256Chronic hypertension396ChildAbortion/fetal death intrauterine14,26–28,31,37,40,42,4350 Malformation congenital25,2611Premature delivery26–28,31,32,3733 Large for gestational age376Low birth weight24,25,3717 Fetal distress256Small for gestational age26,28,3717 Meconium at birth376Deficit in contrast sensitivity386Perinatal hypoxic encephalopathy396Expressive language delay416Deficit in mental development coefficient396Icterus436Acute respiratory distress syndrome436Inguinal hernia436Tachypnea436Late delivery286226 Obstetrical and Gynecological SurveyCopyright © 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

TABLE 5Conclusions of the Studies Included for the Systematic ReviewReference ConclusionsTan et al39Compared with patients without Hypo, patients with treated Hypo are not at any increased riskof perinatal morbidityMirabella et al37TH is definitely necessary for human visual development, and some effects ofTH loss during pregnancy may manifest in structures that are critical for visual processingKasatkina et al38Early correction of gestational hypothyroxinemia with L-T4improved neurointelectual prognosis of offspring,enhancing the mental development of children coefficient in the first year of life. The level of fT4in earlypregnancy showed a significant correlation with brain development in children coefficientIdris et al24T4dose requirement increases during pregnancy and thus close monitoring ofthyroid function with appropriate adjustment of T4dose to maintain a normal serumTSH level is necessary throughout gestation. Within a joint endocrine-obstetric clinic,maternal Hypo at presentation and in the 3rd trim. May increase the risk of low birth weightand the likelihood for cesarean deliveryAbalovich et al25It is suggested to start the treatment with L-T4patients with SCH and OH in early pregnancy.Thus, patients quickly reach the euthyroid state, which may have an impact on the reductionof obstetric risk due to inadequate treatmentAshoor et al40Impaired thyroid function may predispose to miscarriage and fetal death. Previously undiagnosed Hypodiagnosed at 11–13 wk of gestation may be a contributing factor to about 5% of subsequent fetal lossesHenrichs et al41Children of mothers with severe hypothyroxinemia have a higher risk of verbaland nonverbal cognitive delay. Pregnant women with normal and lowTSH/f T4may have children with neurodevelopmental deficits. The ideal is to evaluatethe thyroid in early pregnancy, allowing treatment with iodine or T4supplementationWolfberg et al26Women with Hypo treated had not a higher risk of neonatal adverse outcomesbut may have increased risk of preeclampsiaAbalovich et al27The evolution of pregnancies did not depend on whether the Hypo was overt orsubclinical but mainly on the treatment received. The adequate treatment of Hypoduring gestation minimizes risks and generally makes it possible for pregnanciesto be carried to term without complicationsDe Geyter et al42Although both SCH and ovarian hyperstimulation were associated with an intermediaterise in TSH, the pattern of thyroid function followed similar changes as in euthyroidcontrols and is unlikely to cause the higher miscarriage rate observed in SCHPoulasouchidou et al43Pregestational maternal TSH concentrations tend to be higher in pregnancies affectedby complications in comparison to unaffected ones; pregestational BMI, history ofpreterm deliveries, and gestation week at delivery are significantly associated with anincreased risk of maternal/neonatal complicationsHirsch et al28Abortions and premature deliveries occur infrequently in women with severe Hypo. Intense follow-upand L-T4treatment may improve pregnancy outcomes even when target TSH levels are not reachedHallengren et al14Fetal loss was significantly higher in pregnant women with abnormal TSH comparedwith those with normal TSH values. Thyroid function in pregnant women on T4substitutionshould be monitored early in pregnancy and carefully followed during pregnancy. The T4dose should be increased as needed early in pregnancy to avoid HypoBehrooz et al36IQ level and cognitive performance of children born to L-T4–treated hypothyroid mothersis similar in those whose mothers have M-SCH during pregnancy compared with thosewhose mothers have normal serum TSH concentrations during pregnancyAbalovich et al29To achieve ideal serum TSH and fT4concentrations in women with Hypo during pregnancy,especially during the first trimester, thyroid status on L-T4needs to be optimized even beforethe patient becomes pregnant, and most of them will not need to increase the L-T4doseduring gestation, thus diminishing the risks of an inadequate treatment.Alexander et al31L-T4requirements increase as early as the 5th wk of gestation. Women with Hypo should haveincreased their L-T4dose by approximately 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed. SerumTSH levels should be monitored, and the L-T4dose adjusted accordinglySpremovic-Radjenovicet al32High fetal fT4levels were unexpectedly frequent in women with AITD, including maternal autoimmuneHypo and Hyper. Further studies are needed, as well as noninvasive methods to assess fetal thyroid function.Verga et al30The optimal timing for increasing L-T4is the 1st trim of pregnancy, although many patients requireadjustments also during the 2nd and 3rd trim. The etiology of Hypo influences the adjustmentof L-T4therapy and SH patients needed a larger increase than OH and PH.

Some authors reported thatincreased L-T4during pregnancy is necessary to maintaineuthyroidism.24,26,28,30,31According to studies included inthis review, when the TSH levels are 4.2 mIU/L orless in pregnant with diagnosed hypothyroidism, theL-T4replacement could be ≅1.2 μg/kg per day; whenTSH levels are 4.2 to 10 mIU/L, ≅1.4 μg/kg per day;and when TSH levels are greater than 10 mIU/L,≅2.3 μg/kg per day (Fig. 3).Thus, the ideal time to increase the dose of L-T4is inthe first trimester of pregnancy, although many patientsalso require adjustments in therapy during the secondand third trimesters.30Abalovich et al27reported thatthyroid dysfunction should ideally be regulated withL-T4even before the patient becomes pregnant; thus,most women would not need to increase L-T4duringthe gestational period.29The L-T4replacement therapyis expected to resolve the patients' symptoms and hypo-thyroid signs and for normalization of serum T4andFIG. 2.

TSH concentrations and improvement in maternal andneonatal/infant outcomes.45Wolfberg et al26found that women with hypothy-roidism who received treatment were not at risk of de-livering a child with a low birth weight, fetal death, orcongenital abnormality compared with the controlgroup (euthyroidism). However, women who weretreated were more susceptible to chronic hypertensionand had a higher risk of developing preeclampsia com-pared with women without thyroid disease.26The ade-quate diagnosis and monitoring of pregnant women areessential to prevent maternal and fetal complicationsthat are related to hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism thatis diagnosed between the 11th and 13th weeks of preg-nancy may be a contributing factor to 5% of fetal loss.40In addition, the evolution of pregnancy does not dependon whether hypothyroidism is manifest or subclinicalbut rather depends on the treatment that is received.27Individuals with primary hypothyroidism often havesufficient functional thyroid tissue to increase thyroidsecretion in response to human chorionic gonadotropin,appropriately subverting the changes in early preg-nancy. However, individuals with thyroid dysfunctionor the absence of the thyroid have no means to increasethe production of thyroid hormones and require in-creased exogenous thyroid hormone replacement fromthe beginning of pregnancy.22We observed variability in the total number of indi-viduals who participated in the studies reviewed hereinand the number of patients with hypothyroidism. Therewere few clinical trials and randomized studies thatevaluated the effectiveness of L-T4dose adjustment tomaintain adequate levels of thyroid hormones and avoidpregnancy complications. Considering the 18 articles thatwere included in the present review, only 11 reported pos-sible bias (Table 5), and these were highlighted asselection bias (sampling, rarity of maternal and congen-ital hypothyroidism),28,32,36–38,40,42,43the use of retro-spective methodology to obtain the data,24,28,36,37,41and failure to choose the evaluated parameters and toselect group and control individuals.27,28,32,36,41–43For these reasons, we encourage performing studieson maternal and newborn complications associatedwith treated and untreated hypothyroidism. We suggestthat clinical trials and studies with prospective cohortdesigns should be conducted to evaluate the therapeuticefficacy of reducing child and maternal complicationsin pregnant women who are diagnosed with hypothy-roidism. No consensus has been reached regarding theassociation between hypothyroidism and maternal-fetal complications. Most of the studies that reportedthis association concluded that hormone levels mustbe regulated during pregnancy to avoid pregnancycomplications, and it is important that the L-T4dose isadjusted according to the levels of TSH and fT4andage of pregnancy.REFERENCES1.

Therefore, the percentage of participants with known hypothyroidism who became pregnant without monitoring was clearly high (8)(9)(10).

Material and methods A retrospective cross-sectional study of women whose pregnancies occurred between 2014 and 2016 was conducted, including 120,763 pregnancies in Catalonia (Spain). The presence of thyroid disorders in women was based on disease diagnostic codes and/or prescription of levothyroxine or antithyroid drugs. To evaluate the thyroid disorder diagnosis and monitoring, thyrotropin (TSH), free T4 (FT4), antiperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), and anti-TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) records were gathered and categorised according to the reference values of each laboratory. Results The prevalence of recorded thyroid disorders before the last menstrual period was 5.09% for hypothyroidism and 0.64% for hyperthyroidism,showing a significant increase with age. A thyroid monitoring test was not performed in the year before the last menstrual period in approximately 40% of women with a known thyroid disorder. Amongst the women with hypothyroidism who underwent a TSH test, 31.75% showed an above-normal result. Amongst women previously unknown to have thyroid disorders, 3.12% had elevated TSH levels and 0.73% had low TSH levels. Conclusion A high percentage of Catalan women with a known thyroid disorder were not properly monitored during the year before pregnancy. Amongst those monitored, more than one-third had TSH values outside the reference range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate women with thyroid disorders during pre-pregnancy visits.ViewShow abstract... Shinohara et al in their review observed that maternal hypothyroid is associated with increased delivery of lowbirth-weight babies, Ajmani et al also reported that the incidence of LBW is higher among pregnant women with overt hypothyroidism. 3,9 The study observed that hypothyroidism in pregnancy increases the risk of birth asphyxia in the neonates. The study observed reduced APGAR scores at both 1 and 5 minutes among the neonates born to pregnant women with hypothyroid. ...Prevalence of hypothyroidism in first trimester screening and its association with maternal and foetal outcomesArticleFull-text availableAug 2023Ashwini R.Vijayalakshmi K.Sailatha R.Background: Maternal hypothyroid is one of the common thyroid disorder. Hypothyroidism in pregnant women who are not treated can cause premature birth, low birth weight, and respiratory distress in the newborn. Objectives were to find out the prevalence of hypothyroidism in pregnant women during first trimester screening and its association with maternal and foetal outcomes. Methods: The present study was a hospital based study carried out in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, Chettinad Hospital and Research Institute, Kelambakkam, Chennai, India between January 2021 and January 2023. The study was carried out among the pregnant women in the first trimester visiting the outpatient department of the OBG department during the study period. Based on the thyroid profile obtained, the participants were classified into normal, subclinical hypothyroidism and overt hypothyroidism. They were then followed up to record the maternal and foetal outcome. Results: A total of 2017 patients were included in the study. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 15.3%. The distribution of type of delivery was found to be different between hypothyroid and normal groups with more number of women underwent Caesarean delivery (18.24%) in the hypothyroid group than those in normal group. The proportion of low birth weight was also statistically higher (45.28%) in the hypothyroid group than in the normal. Similar pattern was observed with birth asphyxia. The APGAR scores recorded were also significantly lower in the hypothyroid group than in the euthyroid group with p value of less than 0.05. Conclusions: The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 15.3%. In our study, women with hypothyroidism showed adverse maternal and foetal outcome such as more caesarean deliveries, low birth weight, and poor APGAR scores and were found to be statistically significant when compared to euthyroid women.ViewShow abstract... However, there is no uniform standard for the management of pregnancy complicated with hypothyroidism, and it is di cult to nd the balance point of treatment. Pregnant women may not receive timely treatment or over-treatment [23]. Therefore, in this study, 86.7% of the pregnant women took medication during pregnancy, and 70.5% of the pregnant women and 22.9% of the newborns had adverse outcomes. ...Development, validation and clinical utility of a risk prediction model for maternal and infant adverse outcomes in women with hypothyroidismPreprintFull-text availableJun 2023Cuixiang ShaoQi ChenSiwen TangRen Juan SunPurpose. The ability to calculate the absolute risk of adverse maternal and infant outcomes for an individual woman with hypothyroidism would allow preventative and therapeutic interventions to be delivered to women and infant at high-risk, sparing women and infant at low-risk from unnecessary care. We aimed to develop, validate and evaluate the clinical utility of a prediction model for adverse maternal and infant adverse outcomes in women with hypothyroidism. Methods. A prediction model development and validation study was conducted on data from a retrospective cohort. Participants included all women with hypothyroidism from a tertiary hospital in Wuxi, Jiangsu, China. The development and validation cohort comprised those who delivered between 1 October 2020 to 31 December 2022.The main outcome was a composite of critically important maternal and neonatal complications. Logistic regression was used to develop prediction models. Model performance was measured in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. Results. Nine variables were selected to establish the prediction model of adverse maternal and infant outcomes in pregnancy with hypothyroidism. AUC indicated that the discriminant power of the nomogram was satisfactory. In the model for predicting adverse maternal outcomes, the training set AUC was 0.845 and the validation set AUC was 0.779. In the model for predicting adverse neonatal outcomes, the training set AUC was 0.685 and the validation set AUC was 0.787. The calibration plots show good agreement between the predictions of the nomograms and the actual observations in both the training and validation cohorts. The established nomograms (partial factors) performed significantly better than the nomograms constructed with all factors. In addition, DCA suggests that nomograms are clinically useful and have better discriminative power to identify high-risk mother-infant patients. Conclusion Predictive models were developed and validated to help clinicians assess maternal and infant outcomes in pregnancy with hypothyroidism and to aid in decision-making on treatment.ViewShow abstract...

A wide range of symptoms, from nausea to ectopic pregnancy, are usually aligned with risk factors like abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, etc. An estimated total of 15% of total pregnant women face serious complications requiring urgent attention for safe pregnancy survival. Over the past decades, several changes in the environment and nutrition habits have increased the possibility of unfavourable changes during the gestation phase. The diagnostic factors, management and nutritional interventions are targeted and more emphasis has been laid on modifying or managing the nutritional factors in this physiologically stressed phase. Aims: This review focuses on dietary modifications and nutritional interventions for the treatment of complications of pregnancy. Nutritional management has been identified to be one of the primary necessities in addition to drug therapy. It is important to set a healthy diet pattern throughout the gestation phase or even before by incorporating key nutrients into the maternal diet. Methods: The published literature from various databases including PubMed, Google Scholar and ScienceDirect were used to establish the fact of management and treatment of complications of pregnancy. Results: The recommendations of dietary supplements have underlined the concept behind the eradication of maternal deficiencies and improving metabolic profiles. Conclusion: Therefore, the present review summarises the dietary recommendations to combat pregnancy-related complications which are necessary in order to prevent and manage the same.ViewShow abstract... Hypothyroidism affects up to 4% of all pregnancies and, if untreated, can result in gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, low birth weight, postpartum hemorrhage, congenital malformations, premature birth, placental abruption, and impaired neuropsychological development, specifically expressive language deficits.

Thyroid testing is not routinely performed during pregnancy at our center, as testing would find mostly subclinical hypothyroidism, and treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism did not improve neurological outcomes in a clinical trial in normal pregnancies. ...Impaired Maternal-Fetal Environment and Risk for Preoperative Focal White Matter Injury in Neonates With Complex Congenital Heart DiseaseArticleFull-text availableMar 2023 Daniel J Licht Marin Jacobwitz Jennifer M. LynchMary E PuttBackground Infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) are at risk for white matter injury (WMI) before neonatal heart surgery. Better knowledge of the causes of preoperative WMI may provide insights into interventions that improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in these patients. Methods and Results A prospective single‐center study of preoperative WMI in neonates with CHD recorded data on primary cardiac diagnosis, maternal‐fetal environment (MFE), delivery type, subject anthropometrics, and preoperative care. Total maturation score and WMI were assessed, and stepwise logistic regression modeling selected risk factors for WMI. Among subjects with severe CHD (n=183) who received a preoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging, WMI occurred in 40 (21.9%) patients. WMI prevalence (21.4%–22.1%) and mean volumes (119.7–160.4 mm ³ ) were similar across CHD diagnoses. Stepwise logistic regression selected impaired MFE (odds ratio [OR], 2.85 [95% CI, 1.29–6.30]), male sex (OR, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.03–5.36]), and older age at surgery/magnetic resonance imaging (OR, 1.20 per day [95% CI, 1.03–1.41]) as risk factors for preoperative WMI and higher total maturation score values (OR, 0.65 per unit increase [95% CI, 0.43–0.95]) as protective. A quarter (24.6%; n=45) of subjects had ≥1 components of impaired MFE (gestational diabetes [n=12; 6.6%], gestational hypertension [n=11; 6.0%], preeclampsia [n=2; 1.1%], tobacco use [n=9; 4.9%], hypothyroidism [n=6; 3.3%], and other [n=16; 8.7%]). In a subset of 138 subjects, an exploratory analysis of additional MFE‐related factors disclosed other potential risk factors for WMI. Conclusions This study is the first to identify impaired MFE as an important risk factor for preoperative WMI. Vulnerability to preoperative WMI was shared across CHD diagnoses.ViewShow abstractAuthor Correction: Pre-eclampsiaArticleJul 2023Evdokia Dimitriadis Daniel L.

Rolnik Wei Zhou Ellen MenkhorstPre-eclampsia is a life-threatening disease of pregnancy unique to humans and a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women who survive pre-eclampsia have reduced life expectancy, with increased risks of stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, while babies from a pre-eclamptic pregnancy have increased risks of preterm birth, perinatal death and neurodevelopmental disability and cardiovascular and metabolic disease later in life. Pre-eclampsia is a complex multisystem disease, diagnosed by sudden-onset hypertension (>20 weeks of gestation) and at least one other associated complication, including proteinuria, maternal organ dysfunction or uteroplacental dysfunction. Pre-eclampsia is found only when a placenta is or was recently present and is classified as preterm (delivery <37 weeks of gestation), term (delivery ≥37 weeks of gestation) and postpartum pre-eclampsia. The maternal syndrome of pre-eclampsia is driven by a dysfunctional placenta, which releases factors into maternal blood causing systemic inflammation and widespread maternal endothelial dysfunction. Available treatments target maternal hypertension and seizures, but the only 'cure' for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the dysfunctional placenta and baby, often prematurely. Despite decades of research, the aetiology of pre-eclampsia, particularly of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, remains poorly defined. Significant advances have been made in the prediction and prevention of preterm pre-eclampsia, which is predicted in early pregnancy through combined screening and is prevented with daily low-dose aspirin, starting before 16 weeks of gestation. By contrast, the prediction of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia is limited and there are no preventive treatments. Future research must investigate the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia, in particular of term and postpartum pre-eclampsia, and evaluate new prognostic tests and treatments in adequately powered clinical trials.ViewShow abstractShow moreManagement of hypothyroidism with combination thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) hormone replacement in clinical practice: A review of suggested guidanceArticleFull-text availableJan 2018 Colin DayanVijay PanickerBackground Whilst trials of combination levothyroxine/liothyronine therapy versus levothyroxine monotherapy for thyroid hormone replacement have not shown any superiority, there remains a small subset of patients who do not feel well on monotherapy. Whilst current guidelines do not suggest routine use of combination therapy they do acknowledge a trial in such patients may be appropriate. It appears that use of combination therapy and dessicated thyroid extract is not uncommon but often being used by non-specialists and not adequately monitored. This review aims to provide practical advice on selecting patients, determining dose and monitoring of such a trial. Main bodyIt is important to select the correct patient for a trial so as to not delay diagnosis or potentially worsen an undiagnosed condition. An appropriate starting dose may be calculated but accuracy is limited by available formulations and cost. Monitoring of thyroid function, benefits and adverse effects are vital in the trial setting given lack of evidence of safe long term use. Also important is that patients understand set up of the trial, potential risks involved and give consent. Conclusion Whilst evidence is lacking on whether a small group of patients may benefit from combination therapy a trial may be indicated in those who remain symptomatic despite adequate levothyroxine monotherapy. This should be undertaken by clinicians experienced in the field with appropriate monitoring for adverse outcomes in both short and long term.ViewShow abstractEffects of Subclinical Hypothyroidism on Maternal and Perinatal Outcomes during Pregnancy: A Single-Center Cohort Study of a Chinese PopulationArticleFull-text availableOct 2014PLOS ONELiang-Miao ChenWen-Jun DuJie DaiXue-Mian LuOBJECTIVE: Adverse maternal outcomes and perinatal complications are closely associated with overt maternal hypothyroidism, but whether these complications occur in women with subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) during pregnancy remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of SCH on maternal and perinatal outcomes during pregnancy. METHODS: A prospective study of data from 8012 pregnant women (371 women with SCH, 7641 euthyroid women) was performed. Maternal serum samples were collected in different trimesters to examine thyroid hormone concentrations. SCH was defined as a thyroid stimulating hormone concentration exceeding the trimester-specific reference value with a normal free thyroxine concentration. The occurrence of maternal outcomes, including gestational hypertension (GH), gestational diabetes mellitus, placenta previa, placental abruption, prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM), and premature delivery; and perinatal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal distress, low birth weight (LBW; live birth weight ≤ 2500 g), stillbirth, and malformation, was recorded. Logistic regression with adjustment for confounding demographic and medical factors was used to determine the risks of adverse outcomes in patients with SCH. RESULTS: Compared with euthyroid status, SCH was associated with higher rates of GH (1.819% vs. 3.504%, P = 0.020; χ2 = 7.345; odds ratio (OR), 2.243; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.251-4.024), PROM (4.973% vs. 8.625%, P = 0.002; χ2 = 72.102; adjusted OR, 6.014; 95% CI, 3.975-9.099), IUGR (1.008% vs. 2.965%ViewShow abstractEffects of thyroid hormones on the heartArticleFull-text availableNov 2014 Hernando Vargas-UricoecheaAnilsa Bonelo-Perdomo Carlos H. Sierra-TorresLas Hormonas Tiroideas (HT) tienen un impacto significativo sobre la función cardiaca, el cual es mediado por efectos genómicos y no-genómicos. Como consecuencia, la deficiencia y el exceso de las HT origina profundos cambios en la regulación de la función cardiaca y en algunos aspectos hemodinámicos y cardiovasculares. Las HT supra-regulan la expresión de la ATPasa activada por calcio del retículo sarcoplasmático, e infra-regulan la expresión de fosfolambán. En general, el hipertiroidismo se caracteriza por un incremento en la frecuencia cardiaca en reposo, del volumen sanguíneo, de la contractilidad miocárdica y del volumen sistólico, entre otros. El desarrollo de “Falla cardiaca de alto gasto” en hipertiroidismo puede ser debido a “Cardiomiopatía mediada por taquicardia”. Por otro lado; en el estado hipotiroideo, la deficiencia de HT origina bradicardia, debilidad en la contractilidad y relajación miocárdica, con prolongación del tiempo sistólico y diastólico temprano. La disminución en la precarga se debe a las alteraciones en la función diastólica; la post-carga se incrementa, y las funciones cronotrópicas e inotrópicas están disminuidas. El hipotiroidismo subclínico incrementa el riesgo de mortalidad por Enfermedad Arterial Coronaria (EAC) y de eventos por EAC, pero no aumenta el riesgo de mortalidad total. El riesgo de mortalidad por EAC y de fibrilación auricular (pero no de otros resultados) en hipertiroidismo subclínico es mayor entre pacientes con niveles muy bajos de tirotropina. Finalmente, medicamentos como la amiodarona puede inducir hipotiroidismo (mediado por el efecto de Wolff-Chaikoff, además de hipertiroidismo (mediado por el efecto de Jod-Basedow. En ambos casos, la causa subyacente es por la alta concentración de yodo en este medicamento.ViewShow abstractGuidelines for the Treatment of Hypothyroidism: Prepared by the American Thyroid Association Task Force on Thyroid Hormone ReplacementArticleFull-text availableSep 2014THYROID Jacqueline Jonklaas Antonio C. Bianco Andrew J BauerAnna M SawkaBackground: A number of recent advances in our understanding of thyroid physiology may shed light on why some patients feel unwell while taking levothyroxine monotherapy. The purpose of this task force was to review the goals of levothyroxine therapy, the optimal prescription of conventional levothyroxine therapy, the sources of dissatisfaction with levothyroxine therapy, the evidence on treatment alternatives, and the relevant knowledge gaps. We wished to determine whether there are sufficient new data generated by well-designed studies to provide reason to pursue such therapies and change the current standard of care. This document is intended to inform clinical decision-making on thyroid hormone replacement therapy; it is not a replacement for individualized clinical judgment. Methods: Task force members identified 24 questions relevant to the treatment of hypothyroidism. The clinical literature relating to each question was then reviewed. Clinical reviews were supplemented, when relevant, with related mechanistic and bench research literature reviews, performed by our team of translational scientists. Ethics reviews were provided, when relevant, by a bioethicist. The responses to questions were formatted, when possible, in the form of a formal clinical recommendation statement. When responses were not suitable for a formal clinical recommendation, a summary response statement without a formal clinical recommendation was developed. For clinical recommendations, the supporting evidence was appraised, and the strength of each clinical recommendation was assessed, using the American College of Physicians system. The final document was organized so that each topic is introduced with a question, followed by a formal clinical recommendation. Stakeholder input was received at a national meeting, with some subsequent refinement of the clinical questions addressed in the document. Consensus was achieved for all recommendations by the task force. Results: We reviewed the following therapeutic categories: (i) levothyroxine therapy, (ii) non-levothyroxine-based thyroid hormone therapies, and (iii) use of thyroid hormone analogs. The second category included thyroid extracts, synthetic combination therapy, triiodothyronine therapy, and compounded thyroid hormones. Conclusions: We concluded that levothyroxine should remain the standard of care for treating hypothyroidism. We found no consistently strong evidence for the superiority of alternative preparations (e.g., levothyroxine-liothyronine combination therapy, or thyroid extract therapy, or others) over monotherapy with levothyroxine, in improving health outcomes. Some examples of future research needs include the development of superior biomarkers of euthyroidism to supplement thyrotropin measurements, mechanistic research on serum triiodothyronine levels (including effects of age and disease status, relationship with tissue concentrations, as well as potential therapeutic targeting), and long-term outcome clinical trials testing combination therapy or thyroid extracts (including subgroup effects). Additional research is also needed to develop thyroid hormone analogs with a favorable benefit to risk profile.ViewShow abstractMaternal Thyroid Dysfunction and Risk of Seizure in the Child: A Danish Nationwide Cohort StudyArticleFull-text availableJan 2013J Pregnancy Stine Linding AndersenPeter Laurberg Chun Sen Wu Jørn OlsenThyroid hormones are essential for brain development, and maternal thyroid disease may affect child neurocognitive development. Some types of seizures may also depend upon early exposure of the developing central nervous system, and we hypothesized that maternal thyroid dysfunction could increase the risk of seizure in the child. In a Danish population-based study we included 1,699,693 liveborn singletons, and from the Danish National Hospital Register we obtained information on maternal diagnosis of hyper- or hypothyroidism and neonatal seizure, febrile seizure, and epilepsy in the child. Maternal diagnosis of thyroid dysfunction before or after birth of the child was registered in two percent of the singleton births. In adjusted analyses, maternal hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism first time diagnosed after birth of the child were associated with a significant increased risk of epilepsy in the child. Moreover, hypothyroidism diagnosed after birth of the child was associated with a significant increased risk of neonatal and febrile seizures. No significant association was seen for maternal diagnosis prior to birth of the child. We speculate if some degree of maternal thyroid dysfunction was already present during the pregnancy in mothers diagnosed after birth of the child and if this untreated condition may present a neurodevelopmental risk.ViewShow abstractPregnancy outcomes in women with severe hypothyroidismArticleFull-text availableJun 2013EUR J ENDOCRINOL Dania Hirsch Sigal LevyVarda NadlerYoel ToledanoHypothyroidism during pregnancy has been associated with adverse obstetrical outcomes. Most studies focused on subjects with a mild or subclinical disorder. The aims of this study were to determine the relative rate of severe thyroid dysfunction among pregnant women with hypothyroidism, identify related factors, and analyse the impact on pregnancy outcomes. Retrospective case series. The study group included 101 pregnant women (103 pregnancies) with antenatal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level >20.0mIU/L identified from the 2009-2010 computerised database of a health maintenance organisation. Data were collected from the medical records. Pregnancy outcomes were compared with a control group of 205 euthyroid pregnant women during the same period. The study group accounted for 1.04% of all insured pregnant women with recorded hypothyroidism during the study period. Most cases had an autoimmune etiology. All women were treated with levothyroxine during pregnancy. Maximum serum TSH measured 20.11-150mIU/L (median 32.95mIU/L); median serum TSH, 0.36-75.17mIU/L (median 7.44mIU/L). Mean duration of hypothyroidism during pregnancy was 21.2±13.2 weeks (median 18.5 weeks); in 36 cases (34.9%), all TSH levels during pregnancy were elevated. Adverse pregnancy outcomes included abortion 7.8%, premature delivery 2.9%, and other complications 14.6%, with no statistically significant differences from controls. Median serum TSH level during pregnancy was positively correlated with rate of abortions+premature deliveries and rate of all pregnancy-related complications (p<0.05). Abortions and premature deliveries occur infrequently in women with severe hypothyroidism. Intense follow-up and adequate levothyroxine treatment may improve pregnancy outcomes even when target TSH levels are not reached.ViewShow abstractThyroid Diseases and Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes in a Contemporary US CohortArticleFull-text availableJun 2013J CLIN ENDOCR METAB Tuija Männistö Pauline MendolaJagteshwar GrewalS Katherine LaughonContext: Thyroid diseases are inconsistently reported to increase risk for pregnancy complications. Objective: The objective of this study was to study pregnancy complications associated with common and uncommon thyroid diseases. Design, setting, and participants: We analyzed singleton pregnancies (N = 223 512) from a retrospective US cohort, the Consortium on Safe Labor (2002-2008). Thyroid diseases and outcomes were derived from electronic medical records. Multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations estimated adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 99% confidence intervals (99% CI). Main outcome measures: Hypertensive diseases, diabetes, preterm birth, cesarean sections, inductions, and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions were analyzed. Results: Primary hypothyroidism was associated with increased odds of preeclampsia (OR = 1.47, 99% CI = 1.20-1.81), superimposed preeclampsia (OR = 2.25, 99% CI = 1.53-3.29), gestational diabetes (OR = 1.57, 99% CI = 1.33-1.86), preterm birth (OR = 1.34, 99% CI = 1.17-1.53), induction (OR = 1.15, 99% CI = 1.04-1.28), cesarean section (prelabor, OR = 1.31, 99% CI = 1.11-1.54; after spontaneous labor OR = 1.38, 99% CI = 1.14-1.66), and ICU admission (OR = 2.08, 99% CI = 1.04-4.15). Iatrogenic hypothyroidism was associated with increased odds of placental abruption (OR = 2.89, 99% CI = 1.14-7.36), breech presentation (OR = 2.09, 99% CI = 1.07-4.07), and cesarean section after spontaneous labor (OR = 2.05, 99% CI = 1.01-4.16). Hyperthyroidism was associated with increased odds of preeclampsia (OR = 1.78, 99% CI = 1.08-2.94), superimposed preeclampsia (OR = 3.64, 99% CI = 1.82-7.29), preterm birth (OR = 1.81, 99% CI = 1.32-2.49), induction (OR = 1.40, 99% CI = 1.06-1.86), and ICU admission (OR = 3.70, 99% CI = 1.16-11.80). Conclusions: Thyroid diseases were associated with obstetrical, labor, and delivery complications. Although we lacked information on treatment during pregnancy, these nationwide data suggest either that there is a need for better thyroid disease management during pregnancy or that there may be an intrinsic aspect of thyroid disease that causes poor pregnancy outcomes.ViewShow abstractUniversal Screening Versus Case Finding for Detection and Treatment of Thyroid Hormonal Dysfunction During PregnancyArticleAug 2010 Roberto Negro Alan SchwartzRiccardo GismondiAlex Stagnaro-GreenUndiagnosed, untreated thyroid disease in pregnant women has a significant risk of adverse outcomes for both the mother and baby. Screening to identify pregnant women who are hypothyroid or hyperthyroid has been advocated using 2 approaches; the first is universal screening of all pregnant women and the second is a case-finding approach (which involves screening only pregnant women with symptoms of thyroid disease). Both these approaches are controversial. Recent published guidelines recommended using case-finding approach for pregnant women identified as high risk for thyroid disease. However, a report published soon after the guidelines demonstrated that screening of only high-risk pregnancies failed to detect 30% of women with hypothyroid and nearly 70% of hyperthyroid women. Currently, no medical organization recommends universal screening for thyroid disease. This randomized study investigated the effectiveness of thyroid disease treatment during pregnancy on the incidence of maternal and neonatal adverse outcomes and compared the ability of universal screening and case-finding to detect thyroid dysfunction. A total of 4562 women in their first trimester of pregnancy were randomized to either case-finding approach (n = 2282) or universal screening (n = 2280). Women in the 2 groups were classified as high risk or low risk based on the presence of risk factors for thyroid disease. Women with hypothyroidism were defined as having thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) greater than 2.5 mIU/L and being positive for thyroid peroxidase antibody, and women with hyperthyroidism were defined as having undetectable TSH concentration and elevated free T 4 . The sera of all women in the universal screening group and women at high-risk in the case-finding group were immediately tested for TSH, free T4, and thyroid peroxidase antibody. Women with hypothyroidism were treated with levothyroxine; women with hyperthyroid were managed with anti-thyroid medication. There were no significant differences in adverse outcomes between the universal and case-finding screening groups. Fewer low-risk women in the universal screening group had adverse outcomes compared with low-risk women in the case-finding group. The majority of women with thyroid disease were missed by the case-finding approach. These findings show that screening pregnant women for thyroid disease using the case-finding approach is not associated with a greater decease in adverse outcomes than universal screening. Adverse outcomes appear to be less likely among low-risk women in the universal screening group than among low-risk women in the case-finding group.ViewShow abstractSymptoms of HypothyroidismChapterJan 2011Ernst NyströmGertrud E. B. BergSvante K. G. Jansson Stig ValdemarssonIn many cases of early autoimmune thyroiditis, thyroid function is not affected. The patient remains symptom-free with normal concentrations of serum TSH and thyroid hormones but with elevated TPOAb. When thyroid function is affected, there is a slow drop in T4 secretion during development of the disease. TSH secretion increases due to the hypothalamus–pituitary–thyroid feedback system and the impaired functional capacity of the thyroid gland is partly compensated by the increasing TSH concentration (Fig. 11.1). However, the elevated TSH concentration most probably always corresponds to a lower than normal T4 concentration for the individual.ViewShow abstractAssessment of Thyroid Function During First-Trimester Pregnancy: What Is the Rational Upper Limit of Serum TSH During the First Trimester in Chinese Pregnant Women?ArticleNov 2013J CLIN ENDOCR METABChenyan LiZhongyan Shan Jinyuan Mao Weiping TengContext: Guidelines of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) proposed that the upper limit of the TSH reference range should be 2.5 mIU/L in first trimester, but the reported ranges in China are significantly higher. Objective: Our objective was to establish a rational reference range of serum TSH for diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism in the first trimester of pregnant women in China. Design: We screened 4800 pregnant women in the first trimester and 2000 women who planned to become pregnant and evaluated 535 pregnant women in follow-up visits during the second and third trimester. Results: Median concentrations of serum TSH decreased significantly from the seventh week of gestation. The median of TSH from 4 to 6 weeks was significantly higher than from 7 to 12 weeks (2.15 [0.56-5.31] mIU/L vs 1.47 [0.10-4.34] mIU/L, P<.001); however, there was no significant difference compared with nonpregnant women (2.07 [0.69-5.64] mIU/L; P=.784). The median of free T4 was not significantly altered in the first trimester. The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in the 4800 pregnant women was 27.8% on the diagnostic criteria of TSH>2.5 mIU/L and 4.0% using the reference interval derived by our laboratory (0.14-4.87 mIU/L).Additionally, of 118 pregnant women who had serum TSH>2.5 mIU/L in the first trimester, only 30.0% and 20.3% of them at the 20th and 30th week of gestation had TSH>3.0 mIU/L. Conclusions: The reference range for nonpregnant women can be used for the assessment of pregnant women at 4 to 6 weeks of gestation. The upper limit of serum TSH in the first trimester was much higher than 2.5 mIU/L in Chinese pregnant women.ViewShow abstractShow moreRecommended publicationsDiscover moreArticleInterleukin-10 -1082 G/A promoter polymorphism and pregnancy complications: Results of a prospective...February 2008 · Acta Obstetricia Et Gynecologica ScandinavicaFelix StonekM MetzenbauerE Hafner[...]Clemens TempferTo investigate the frequency of the interleukin-10 (IL-10)-1082 G/A single nucleotide polymorphism in women with intrauterine fetal death (IUFD), pre-eclampsia (PE), preterm delivery (PD), and small for gestational age (SGA) infants.

The course of pregnancy was analyzed retrospectively in patients with kidney or kidney-pancreas transplant, surveying maternal-fetal or renal graft complications and the relation with pre-pregnancy renal function. Methods: A cohort that includes all the kidney transplant recipients who went ... [Show full abstract] through pregnancy in Uruguay in a period of 28 years is described. Forty pregnancies in 32 patients were registered; the average time between the kidney transplant and the beginning of the gestation period was 47 months. From the total gestations, 10 abortions, 1 neonatal death, and 1 fetal demise were registered. From the remaining pregnancies, we highlight prematurity (18/29) and low birth weight (14/21). Twenty-nine in 30 pregnancies ended in cesarean section; in 8 of 30, pre-eclampsia diagnosis was performed. Acute rejection was diagnosed in 2 of 30 pregnancies, both undergoing their first post-transplant year. Results: Two patients required dialysis throughout the pregnancy because of progress into severe renal insufficiency. Higher obstetric perinatal morbidity and renal function deterioration was related to lower pre-pregnancy glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Conclusions: A successful pregnancy is possible in transplant recipients, yet there are risks of prematurity, low birth weight, and abortion. A lower GFR before pregnancy was associated with poorer maternal and perinatal results as shown in the different series.Read moreArticleAntiphospholipid Syndrome and ThrombosisJanuary 2007 · Clinical Obstetrics & GynecologyD.

Among 1,696 consecutive patients (728 men and 968 women) who underwent an appendectomy at our institution (1996-2005), 87 pregnant women were identified. Postoperative surgical and obstetric outcomes were analyzed based on the final pathologic report of ... [Show full abstract] the appendix (normal appendix, inflamed, or perforated). The NA rate was significantly higher in pregnant women compared with nonpregnant women (36% vs 14%; P < .05). The fetal demise rate was similar between the NA group and the inflamed group (3% vs 2%; P = NS), and highest (14%) in the perforated group, although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = .3). Wound infections were most frequent in the perforated group (P < .05). NA during pregnancy is not free of risk to the fetus. We recommend careful assessment to avoid unnecessary exploration when appendicitis is suspected in pregnant women.Read moreLast Updated: 03 Oct 2023Discover the world's researchJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.Join for free ResearchGate iOS AppGet it from the App Store now.InstallKeep up with your stats and moreAccess scientific knowledge from anywhere orDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?
