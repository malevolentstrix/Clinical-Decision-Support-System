Temporal trends in complications were examined. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of cardiac complications and these were incorporated into a new risk index.ResultsIn total, 1,938 pregnancies were included. Cardiac complications occurred in 16% of pregnancies and were primarily related to arrhythmias and heart failure. Although the overall rates of cardiac complications during pregnancy did not change over the years, the frequency of pulmonary edema decreased (8% from 1994 to 2001 vs. 4% from 2001 to 2014; p value = 0.012). Ten predictors of maternal cardiac complications were identified: 5 general predictors (prior cardiac events or arrhythmias, poor functional class or cyanosis, high-risk valve disease/left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, systemic ventricular dysfunction, no prior cardiac interventions); 4 lesion-specific predictors (mechanical valves, high-risk aortopathies, pulmonary hypertension, coronary artery disease); and 1 delivery of care predictor (late pregnancy assessment). These 10 predictors were incorporated into a new risk index (CARPREG II [Cardiac Disease in Pregnancy Study]).ConclusionsPregnancy in women with heart disease continues to be associated with significant morbidity, although mortality is rare. Prediction of maternal cardiac complications in women with heart disease is enhanced by integration of general, lesion-specific, and delivery of care variables.Central IllustrationDownload : Download high-res image (104KB)Download : Download full-size imagePrevious article in issueNext article in issueKey Wordsarrhythmiacardiologycardiomyopathycongenital heart diseaseheart failuremortalityoutcomespregnancyrisk scorevalve diseaseAbbreviations and AcronymsCIconfidence intervalHFheart failureLVOTleft ventricular outflow tractmWHOmodified World Health OrganizationNYHANew York Heart AssociationWHOWorld Health OrganizationLoading...Recommended articlesCited by (0)This study was supported in part by operating grants provided by the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (NA 5662), Canadian Institutes of Health Research (MOP 111139 and 119353), and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation.
