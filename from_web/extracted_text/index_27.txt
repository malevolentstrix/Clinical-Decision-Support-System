Our systematic review of the literature on the use of targeted treatments for pulmonary arterial hypertension during pregnancy indicates a considerable decrease of mortality since a previous review in 1998 (16% v 38%), and a further non-significant decrease in mortality since the latest review in 2009 (16% v 25%). In addition to the use of targeted treatments, the timely institution of these treatments, and early planned delivery, may contribute to better outcome. Furthermore, research suggests that women with mild pulmonary hypertension or favourable functional class may have a better prognosis, but there is yet no proof of decreased mortality among these women. Despite an improved prognosis, pregnancy is contra-indicated in women with pulmonary hypertension and, when pregnancy occurs, termination should be considered. When pregnancy continues, management by a multidisciplinary team in a specialist centre is indicated.IntroductionPulmonary hypertension is a rare disease with different causes. Despite improvements in treatment options, it still carries a grave prognosis, with significant morbidity and mortality. The haemodynamic changes of pregnancy are not well tolerated in women with pulmonary hypertension. Mortality has been described in up to 50% of women with pulmonary hypertension [1]. Prognosis has improved in recent years, but pregnancy is still contraindicated in women with pulmonary hypertension ∗[2], ∗[3]. In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of the diagnosis, classification and pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. We also review modern treatment options and available published research on pregnancy in women with pulmonary hypertension. Our specific aims are to establish what factors determine prognosis of pregnant women with pulmonary hypertension. We systematically reviewed the literature describing the outcome of pregnancy in women treated with targeted pulmonary hypertension treatments.Section snippetsDefinition, classification and pathology of pulmonary hypertensionPulmonary hypertension is defined as an increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) 25 mm Hg or over at rest as assessed by right heart catheterisation [4]. At the fourth World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension in Dana Point (2008), a clinical classification of pulmonary hypertension was agreed upon (Table 1), and this has now been incorporated into the European Guidelines [4]. Haemodynamically, pulmonary hypertension associated with left heart disease (group 2) can be characterisedHaemodynamic and haemostatic changes in pregnant women with pulmonary hypertensionEarly in pregnancy, plasma volume starts to increase and, by the end of the second trimester, an increase in plasma volume of 40% volume is achieved. Red blood cell mass increases by 20–30%. Systemic vascular resistance decreases. As a result of these changes, cardiac output increases. In normal pregnancy, this is achieved mainly by an increase in stroke volume in the first and second trimester, whereas, later in pregnancy, heart rate also increases and contributes to the increase in cardiacMaternal pregnancy outcomeDespite the well-recognized risk of pregnancy, pulmonary hypertension could not be identified as a predictor of maternal outcome in two large studies on pregnancy outcome in women with heart disease [6], [7]. This can be explained by the low prevalence of pulmonary hypertension in these two studies, which were carried out in western countries. Pulmonary hypertension is a rare condition in women of fertile age and, with the diagnosis, women are generally advised against pregnancy. In a KoreanCurrent therapeutic strategies in pulmonary hypertensionTherapeutic strategies in non-pregnant women vary with the clinical classification. Anticoagulation therapy is usually prescribed in women with idiopathic and inheritable PAH and PAH associated with anorexigens. It may also be considered in group 1.4 PAH depending on the underlying disease. In women with portal hypertension or Eisenmenger syndrome, the risk of bleeding is often elevated (e.g. oesophageal varices and haemoptysis), and the use of anticoagulation therapy is thereforeSystematic review of targeted pulmonary hypertension treatment and pregnancy outcomeWe carried out a systematic review of the literature to analyse the outcome of pregnancy in women with pulmonary hypertension who had been treated with targeted pulmonary hypertension treatments (calcium channel blockers, nitric oxide, prostacyclin derivates, ERA, or phosphodiesterase inhibitors).Management of reproductive issues in women with pulmonary hypertensionAlthough mortality has decreased over time, it is still high, and it is difficult to identify women who have a lower risk. Therefore, in line with current guidelines, all women with established pulmonary hypertension should be advised against pregnancy [2]. This also implies that girls and women must be informed about safe and effective contraception [50].

Patients with SLE-PAH tend to have lower survival rates and worse quality of life than other subgroups of PAH.Presented in this report is a 28-year-old primipara who suffered from SLE for 13 years and SLE-PAH for nine years. She had cardiac care throughout these years. She was admitted at 26 weeks of gestation for progressive dyspnea on exertion and her condition improved after a three-week PAH-targeted therapy consisting of prostacyclin and PDE-5 inhibitor. At 29 weeks of gestation, she was infected with influenza H1N1 and her clinical status deteriorated with increased dyspnea. After two weeks of influenza therapy and maximization of PAH therapy, a cesarean delivery was performed under epidural anesthesia at 31 weeks of gestation. She was discharged ten days after delivery. Although the targeted therapy for both PAH and SLE was readjusted after delivery and regular follow-up showed a gradual recovery and a stable condition, she still died suddenly at home 12 months after delivery. The child is healthy.Sequential combination therapy of PAH and SLE and the structured perinatal management might lead to optimal short-term outcomes in the mother and fetus. Long-term outcomes in women with PAH who become pregnant are poor, with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Delivery strategies remain an important challenge for modern Pregnancy Heart Teams.The effectiveness of Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique on maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes in women with non-severe preeclampsia: a randomized clinical trial2022, HeliyonShow abstractPreeclampsia (PE), as the most common major pregnancy disorder, has serious maternal, fetal and neonatal complications, and outcomes. The present study was designed to determine the effectiveness of Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique on maternal, fetal, and neonatal outcomes in women with non-severe preeclampsia (PE).This is a randomized clinical trial conducted from March 21, 2021 to July 22, 2021 in the Kamali referral center in Karaj, Iran. A total of 88 eligible participants were assigned to intervention and control groups (44 in each group) via blocked randomization. The intervention group (6 groups of 6 participants and one group of 8 participants) received Jacobson's progressive muscle relaxation technique in addition to receiving routine care, twice a week for 6 weeks (4 face-to-face sessions and 8 online sessions). The control group only received routine perinatal care. A checklist collected data before and after the intervention. Data were analyzed in SPSS software v.23. To analyze the obtained data, independent t-test, Paired t-test, Mann-Whitney, Chi-square, and Fisher test were used.The results showed a statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups in terms of Systolic Blood pressure (SBP) (P < 0.001), Diastolic Blood pressure (DBP) (P < 0.001), 24-hour urine protein level (proteinuria) (P < 0.001). and Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) (P < 0.001), birth Weight (BW) (P = 0.01), baseline Fetal heart rate (BFHR) (P < 0.001) and Number fetal movements based on non-stress test (NFMsN), during 20 min (P < 0.001) after intervention (P < 0.001).Also In the intervention group, the results showed a statistically significant difference in Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) (P = 0.01), SBP(P < 0.001), DBP(P < 0.001), proteinuria (P < 0.001), FBS(P < 0.001), BFHR based on non-stress test (NST) (P < 0.001), and NFMsN during 20 min (P < 0.001) in the intervention group before and after the intervention. There was no statistically significant difference in the control group.This study's results showed the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation technique on the improvement of SBP, DBP, proteinuria, FBS, FHR and NFMsN during 20 min based on NST and BW in women with non-severe PE. Therefore, it is recommended to perform this technique in health centers.Anesthetic Management of Severe Pulmonary Hypertension in Pregnancy2022, Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular AnesthesiaShow abstractPregnancy entails significant changes in maternal physiology that are not well-tolerated in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. The profound changes in plasma volume, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance can lead to increased strain placed on the right ventricle, leading to right-heart failure and cardiovascular collapse. Given the complex and sometimes opposing physiologic changes, managing these patients can be challenging. As such, these patients have a significantly increased reported maternal mortality rate. This report describes a parturient with newly diagnosed severe pulmonary arterial hypertension and her anesthetic management.Caesarean section under continuous spinal anaesthesia in a parturient with pulmonary hypertension: A case report2021, Annals of Medicine and SurgeryShow abstractWomen with pulmonary hypertension have high morbidity and mortality during pregnancy. The inability to increase cardiac output can lead to heart failure, while hypercoagulability and reduced systemic vascular resistance also lead to other risks.This paper report the case of a parturient admitted for caesarean section under continuous spinal anaesthesia scheduled at 34 weeks of amenorrhea following severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. She had a history of significant mitral insufficiency. The procedure was performed without incident. The catheter was removed immediately postoperatively. The baby was female and in good health. She was transferred to the resuscitation service with restoration of oral nutrition.Loco-regional anaesthesia is to be preferred in pulmonary hypertension associated to pregnancy. In order to reduce the risk of mortality due to general anaesthesia for this type of patient, it is possible to practice the continuous spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section without having hemodynamic consequences.Eisenmenger Syndrome in Pregnancy: A Management Conundrum2020, Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular AnesthesiaCitation Excerpt :Even though pregnancy among women with established pulmonary hypertension is not advisable and should be discouraged,42 recent advances in treatment options and optimization of care of this patient population have led to improved maternal and neonatal outcomes,53 as illustrated in this case. Nevertheless, mortality rates among women with pulmonary hypertension related to CHD and Eisenmenger syndrome remain unacceptably high, at between 23% and 36%.7,9,12 In addition to maternal consequences, Eisenmenger syndrome also is associated with fetal and neonatal adverse outcomes because decreased cardiac output and cyanosis can lead to intrauterine growth restriction and preterm delivery, which can result in neonatal morbidity.View all citing articles on ScopusView full textCopyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
