We sought to investigate the long-term infectious outcomes of children to mothers who were diagnosed with UTI during their pregnancy.MethodsA population-based cohort analysis was conducted at a single tertiary medical center. The study included all singleton deliveries between the years 1991–2014, comparing offspring born to mothers diagnosed with UTI during their pregnancy with those born to non-exposed mothers. Infectious-related hospitalizations of the offspring up to the age of 18 years were assessed according to a predefined set of ICD-9 codes. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was conducted to compare cumulative hospitalization incidence between the groups. A Cox regression model was used to adjust for confounders.ResultsDuring the study period, 243,725 deliveries met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 8034 (3.3%) were exposed to maternal UTI during pregnancy. Infectious-related hospitalizations were significantly prevalent in offspring to exposed mothers (12.3% vs. 11.0%, OR = 1.125, 95% CI 1.051–1.204, Kaplan-Meier log rank p < 0.001). In the Cox regression model, while controlling for clinically relevant confounders, maternal UTI (adjuster HR = 1.240), as well as preterm delivery (adjusted HR = 1.385) and cesarean delivery (adjusted HR = 1.198) were noted as independent risk factors for long-term infectious morbidity of the offspring.ConclusionsMaternal UTI in pregnancy may influence offspring susceptibility to pediatric infections, as it was found to be an independent risk factor for long-term infectious morbidity of the offspring.IntroductionPregnancy is a unique state characterized by both physiologic and immunologic changes. The major changes of the immune system include activation of the innate system whereas the adaptive system is suppressed. Therefore, women are more susceptible to infections during pregnancy [[1], [2], [3]]. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common bacterial infections in pregnant women and is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes [1,3].The overall incidence of UTIs (acute cystitis and pyelonephritis) during pregnancy varies between studies between 2.3 and 8% [1,4], and as in non-pregnant women, the most common bacteria are Escherichia coli [3,5,6], found in 60% of all positive cultures [6]. The signs and symptoms of UTI include urgency, frequency, dysuria, hematuria and pyuria. If fever and costovertebral angle tenderness (especially on the right side) are present, pyelonephritis should be suspected as it is the most common complication of UTI [3,6], mainly during the second and third trimesters [7].In recent studies, untreated UTI during pregnancy was associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and low birth weight, chorioamnionitis and preterm delivery (PTD) [1,6,8,9]. Some studies even demonstrated increased perinatal mortality [3,4].Whether offspring of mothers diagnosed with UTI during pregnancy suffer long-term consequences is unclear. Some studies found UTI to be associated with developmental delay/mental retardation [10] and even childhood epilepsy [11]. Interestingly, in a recent study, maternal genitourinary infection was associated with an increased risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [12]. There are several factors by which UTI could affect the fetus in the long-term. First, the presence of an infecting organism, which by itself is sufficient to cause fetal damage due to various metabolic by-products, colonization, or other bacterial activity [13]. This damage can also extend to years after delivery. For example, a study by Keski-Nisula et al. suggested that intrauterine bacterial growth was associated with respiratory illness among the offspring at the age of 15 to 17 years [14]. Another possible provocative factor was found at the cellular level. The maternal and the fetal immune responses, evoked by the infection, may disrupt fetal development via direct effects of cytokines [13].To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies to date that investigate long-term infectious morbidity in offspring of mothers with UTI in pregnancy. In this large population-based study, we sought to investigate the long-term (up to the age of 18) infectious outcomes of children to mothers who were diagnosed with UTI during their pregnancy, compared with children who were born to non-exposed mothers.Section snippetsMethodsIn this population-based retrospective cohort study, all singleton deliveries between 1991 and 2014 were included. The study is based on a large non-selective population data, as it was conducted at Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC), which is the largest birth center in the country and the sole tertiary medical center in the Negev (southern Israel). It compared deliveries of mothers who were diagnosed with UTI during pregnancy and mothers who were not. The study has been performed inResultsDuring the study period, 243,725 deliveries in SUMC met the inclusion criteria. Of them, 8034 (3.3%) were in mothers that were diagnosed with UTI during pregnancy. Maternal characteristics for both groups are presented in Table 1. Mothers who were exposed to UTI during their pregnancy were older and had higher rates of diabetes mellitus (pre-gestational or gestational) and hypertension (chronic, gestational or preeclampsia). Table 2 compares pregnancy outcomes between the two groups. MeanDiscussionIn this study, we sought to extend the knowledge about the long-term consequences for the offspring whose mother was diagnosed with UTI during pregnancy, since they are the most common bacterial infections in pregnant women [1,3]. We found that children born to mothers who were diagnosed with UTI during their pregnancy had an increased risk for neonatal and pediatric infectious morbidity, including ENT and respiratory infections. The rates were higher both during the neonatal period (and up toFunding/supportThis research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.DisclosuresFinancial Disclosures: No financial disclosures.Ram Cohen wrote the first draft of the manuscript.

UTI is reported to affect 20% of pregnant women and is a major cause of pregnant women getting treatment in obstetric rooms.7–11 The importance of increasing the knowledge and skills of students about the physical examination of the urinary system of pregnant women is one of the methods used to recognize abnormal signs in the urinary system of pregnant women so that it can help prevent and reduce the incidence of morbidity and death of pregnant women and fetuses.Show abstractThis study aims to analyze the effectiveness of learning media based on Augmented Reality (AR) on improving the physical examination skills of the urinary system of pregnant women.This type of research is an experimental study with a quasi-experimental non-equivalent control group design conducted in January–February 2020 at the Midwifery Polytechnic Laboratory of the Ministry of Health Gorontalo. A sample of 92 students was selected by purposive sampling and met the inclusion criteria. Then the sample was divided into two groups: a control group that was given material through lecture and demonstration methods totaling 30 respondents and an intervention group that was given material through AR learning media and a method of demonstration totaling 62 respondents. Data collection was performed using a checklist to assess student skills improvement. Data were analyzed using the Cochran test to determine differences in skills over time.There was an increase in skills in the control and intervention groups with a statistically significant P < 0.001 (P < 0.05). However, the results showed that the mean improvement in skills in the week I of the study in the intervention group who were given AR learning media was higher in the percentage of skill improvement (72.6%) when compared to the control group who were given the lecture method and the demonstration method (36.7%). Likewise, the mean increase in skills in week II of the study in the intervention group was higher in the percentage of skill improvement (91.9%) compared to the control group given the lecture and demonstration method (66.7%), although in the third week all respondents in the control group and group the intervention becomes skilled at carrying out a physical examination of the urinary system of pregnant women.AR media is more effective in improving student skills.The significance of maternal asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy on long-term offspring infectious hospitalizations2022, Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and DiseaseEarly exposure to infections increases the risk of allergic rhinitis—a systematic review and meta-analysis2023, BMC PediatricsThe association between fetal gender in twin pregnancies and the risk of pediatric infectious diseases of the offspring: A population-based cohort study with long-term follow up2022, Journal of PerinatologyPerinatal outcome and long-term infectious hospitalizations of offspring born to women with known drug allergy2022, American Journal of Reproductive ImmunologyCommon maternal infections during pregnancy and childhood leukaemia in the offspring: Findings from six international birth cohorts2022, International Journal of EpidemiologyView all citing articles on Scopus☆This study was conducted as part of the requirements for MD degree from the Goldman Medical School at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.View full text© 2019 Elsevier B.V.
