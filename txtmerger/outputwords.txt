Physical Activity and Exercise During Pregnancy and
the Postpartum Period
ABSTRACT Exercise defined as physical activity consisting of planned structured and repetitive bodily
movements done to improve one or more components of physical fitness is an essential element of a healthy
lifestyle and obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should encourage their patients to
continue or to commence exercise as an important component of optimal health Women who habitually engaged
in vigorous intensity aerobic activity or who were physically active before pregnancy can continue these activities
during pregnancy and the postpartum period Observational studies of women who exercise during pregnancy
have shown benefits such as decreased gestational diabetes mellitus cesarean birth and operative vaginal deliv
ery and postpartum recovery time Physical activity also can be an essential factor in the prevention of depressive
disorders of women in the postpartum period Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are associated
with minimal risks and have been shown to benefit most women although some modification to exercise routines
may be necessary because of normal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal requirements In the absence of
obstetric or medical complications or contraindications physical activity in pregnancy is safe and desirable and
pregnant women should be encouraged to continue or to initiate safe physical activities This document has been
revised to incorporate recent evidence regarding the benefits and risks of physical activity and exercise during
pregnancy and the postpartum period
Recommendations
Regular physical activity in all phases of life including
pregnancy promotes health benefits Pregnancy is an
ideal time for maintaining or adopting a healthy lifestyle
and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecol
ogists makes the following recommendations
Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are
associated with minimal risks and have been shown
to benefit most women although some modification
to exercise routines may be necessary because of
normal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal
requirements
A thorough clinical evaluation should be conducted
before recommending an exercise program to ensure
that a patient does not have a medical reason to avoid
exercise
VOL NO APRIL
Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be
encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength
conditioning exercises before during and after
pregnancy
Obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should evaluate women with medical or
obstetric complications carefully before making rec
ommendations on physical activity participation during
pregnancy Activity restriction should not be prescribed
routinely as a treatment to reduce preterm birth
Additional research is needed to study the effects of
exercise on pregnancy specific conditions and out
comes and to clarify further effective behavioral coun
seling methods and the optimal type frequency and
intensity of exercise Similar research is needed to create
an improved evidence base concerning the effects of
occupational physical activity on maternal fetal health
OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY
Introduction
This document has been revised to incorporate recent
evidence regarding the benefits and risks of physical
activity and exercise during pregnancy and the post
partum period Physical activity defined as any bodily
movement produced by the contraction of skeletal
muscles in all stages of life maintains and improves
cardiorespiratory fitness reduces the risk of obesity and
associated comorbidities and results in greater longev
ity Women who begin their pregnancy with a healthy
lifestyle eg exercise good nutrition nonsmoking
should be encouraged to maintain those healthy habits
Women who do not have healthy lifestyles should be
encouraged to view the prepregnancy period and preg
nancy as opportunities to embrace healthier routines
Exercise defined as physical activity consisting of
planned structured and repetitive bodily movements
done to improve one or more components of physical
fitness is an essential element of a healthy lifestyle
and obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should encourage their patients to continue
or to commence exercise as an important component of
optimal health
The World Health Organization and the American
College of Sports Medicine have issued evidence based
recommendations indicating that the beneficial effects of
exercise in most adults are indisputable and that the
benefits far outweigh the risks
The update to the U S Department of Health
and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for
Americans reinforces prior recommendations of at least
minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity per
week during pregnancy and the postpartum period
This activity should be spread throughout the week The
guidelines advise that women who habitually engaged in
vigorous intensity aerobic activity or who were physi
cally active before pregnancy can continue these activi
ties during pregnancy and the postpartum period
Additionally women who are pregnant should be under
the care of an obstetrician gynecologist or other obstetric
care provider who can monitor the progress of the preg
nancy Women who are pregnant can consult their
obstetrician gynecologist or other obstetric care pro
vider about whether or how to adjust their physical
activity during pregnancy and postpartum
Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor
for early mortality worldwide In pregnancy physical
inactivity and excessive weight gain have been recog
nized as independent risk factors for maternal obesity
and related pregnancy complications including gesta
tional diabetes mellitus GDM Concerns that reg
ular physical activity during pregnancy may cause
miscarriage poor fetal growth musculoskeletal injury
or premature delivery have not been substantiated for
women with uncomplicated pregnancies In the
absence of obstetric or medical complications or contra
indications physical activity in pregnancy is safe and
desirable and pregnant women should be encouraged
to continue or to initiate safe physical activities Box
Box
Most pregnant patients can exercise There are few
maternal medical conditions in which aerobic exercise is
absolutely contraindicated When questions exist regard
ing safety of aerobic exercise in pregnancy consultation
with relevant specialists and subspecialists eg obstetrics
and gynecology maternal fetal medicine cardiology
pulmonology when indicated is advised In women
who have obstetric or medical comorbidities exercise
regimens should be individualized Obstetrician
gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should
evaluate women with medical or obstetric complications
carefully before making recommendations on physical
activity participation during pregnancy
Anatomic and Physiologic Aspects of
Exercise in Pregnancy
Pregnancy results in anatomic and physiologic changes
that should be considered when prescribing exercise The
most distinct changes during pregnancy are weight gain
and a shift in the point of gravity that results in
progressive lordosis These changes lead to an increase
in the forces across joints and the spine during weight
bearing exercise As a result more than of all
pregnant women experience low back pain
Strengthening
abdominal and back muscles
could minimize this risk Blood volume heart rate stroke
volume and cardiac output normally increase during
pregnancy and systemic vascular resistance decreases
Table These hemodynamic changes establish the cir
culatory reserve necessary to sustain the pregnant
woman and fetus at rest and during exercise Maintain
ing a supine position during exercise after weeks of
gestation may result in decreased venous return due to
aortocaval compression from the gravid uterus leading
to hypotension and this hemodynamic change should be

considered when prescribing exercise modifications in
pregnancy
In pregnancy there also are profound respiratory
changes Minute ventilation increases up to pri
marily as a result of the increased tidal volume Because
of a physiologic decrease in pulmonary reserve the
ability to exercise anaerobically is impaired and oxygen
availability for aerobic exercise and increased work load
consistently lags The physiologic respiratory alkalosis of
pregnancy may not be sufficient to compensate for the
developing metabolic acidosis of strenuous exercise
Decreases in subjective work load and maximum exercise
performance in pregnant women particularly in those
who are overweight or obese limit their ability to engage
in more strenuous physical activities Aerobic train
ing in pregnancy has been shown to increase aerobic
capacity in normal weight and overweight pregnant
women
Temperature regulation is highly dependent on
hydration and environmental conditions During exer
cise pregnant women should stay well hydrated wear
loose fitting clothing and avoid high heat and humidity
to protect against heat stress particularly during the first
trimester Although exposure to heat from sources
such as hot tubs saunas or fever has been associated
with an increased risk of neural tube defects exer
cise would not be expected to increase core body tem
perature into the range of concern At least one study
found no association between exercise and neural tube
defects
Fetal Response to Maternal Exercise
Most of the studies addressing fetal response to maternal
exercise have focused on fetal heart rate changes and
birth weight Studies have demonstrated minimum to
moderate increases in fetal heart rate by beats
per minute over the baseline during or after exercise
Three meta analyses concluded that the dif
ferences in birth weight were minimal to none in
women who exercised during pregnancy compared
with controls However women who contin
ued to exercise vigorously during the third trimester
were more likely to deliver infants weighing g
less than comparable controls although there was not
an increased risk of fetal growth restriction A
cohort study that assessed umbilical artery blood flow
fetal heart rates and biophysical profiles before and
after strenuous exercise in the second trimester dem
onstrated that minutes of strenuous exercise was
well tolerated by women and fetuses in active and
inactive pregnant women More data are needed
from athletes who may exert beyond the accepted vig
orous definition of up to of capacity and it is
possible that there is an absolute level of intensity or
duration or both that exists and if exceeded could
place the fetus at risk Individualized exercise prescrip
tions may be warranted in pregnant athletes to ascer
tain whether there is a threshold beyond which fetal
well being may be compromised
Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy
The benefits of exercise during pregnancy are numerous
Box Regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy
has been shown to improve or maintain physical fitness
Observational studies of women who exercise
during pregnancy have shown benefits such as
decreased GDM Odds Ratio OR Cl
cesarean birth Relative Risk
CI and operative vaginal
delivery and postpartum recovery time
Physical activity also can be an essential factor in the
prevention of depressive disorders of women in the
postpartum period In pregnancy greater self
reported overall physical fitness and cardiorespiratory
fitness are associated with less bodily pain lumbar and
sciatic pain and reduced pain disability Studies
are needed to explore whether improving physical fit
ness before and during pregnancy could decrease pain
during the peripartum period
A randomized controlled trial that included
overweight or obese women with uncomplicated
singleton gestations at less than weeks of gestation
found that cycling exercises initiated in the first trimester
and performed at least minutes times per week until
weeks of gestation significantly reduced the incidence
of GDM significantly reduced gestational weight gain at
less than weeks of gestation and lowered neonatal
birth weight Although these investigators found no
significant differences between the exercise and control
groups in the incidence of other outcomes such as pre
term birth gestational hypertension cesarean birth and
macrosomia all these outcomes were less frequent in the
exercise group

Recommending an Exercise Program
Motivational Counseling
Pregnancy is an ideal time for behavior modification and
adoption of a healthy lifestyle because of increased
motivation and frequent access to medical supervision
Patients are more likely to control weight increase
physical activity and improve their diet if their physician
recommends that they do so Motivational counsel
ing tools such as the Five A s Ask Advise Assess Assist
and Arrange originally developed for smoking cessa
tion have been used successfully for diet and exercise
counseling Obstetrician gynecologists and
Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period
other obstetric care providers can consider adopting the
Five A s approach for women with uncomplicated
pregnancies who have no contraindications to exercise
Prescribing an Individualized Exercise Program
The principles of exercise prescription for pregnant
women do not differ from those for the general
population A thorough clinical evaluation should
be conducted before recommending an exercise program
to ensure that a patient does not have a medical reason to
avoid exercise An exercise program that leads to an
eventual goal of moderate intensity exercise for at least
minutes per day on most or all days of the week
should be developed with the patient and adjusted as
medically indicated
Because blunted and normal heart rate responses to
exercise have been reported in pregnant women the use
of ratings of perceived exertion may be a more effective
means to monitor exercise intensity during pregnancy
than heart rate parameters For moderate intensity
exercise ratings of perceived exertion should be
somewhat hard on the Borg ratings of perceived exer
tion scale Table Using the talk test is another way
to measure exertion as long as a woman can carry on
a conversation while exercising she likely is not over
exerting herself Women should be advised to
remain well hydrated avoid long periods of lying flat
on their backs and stop exercising if they have any of
the warning signs listed in Box
Pregnant women who were sedentary before preg
nancy should follow a more gradual progression of

exercise Although an upper level of safe exercise
intensity has not been established women who were
regular exercisers before pregnancy and who have
uncomplicated healthy pregnancies should be able to
engage in high intensity exercise programs such as
jogging and aerobics with no adverse effects High
intensity or prolonged exercise in excess of minutes
can lead to hypoglycemia therefore adequate caloric
intake before exercise or limiting the intensity or length
of the exercise session is essential to minimize this risk
Prolonged exercise should be performed in a ther
moneutral environment or in controlled environmental
conditions facilities with air conditioning and pregnant
women should avoid prolonged exposure to heat
and pay close attention to proper hydration and caloric
intake In studies of pregnant women who exercised in
which physical activity was self paced in a temperature
controlled environment core body temperatures rose
less than over minutes and stayed within safe
limits Table lists suggestions for an exercise plan
in pregnancy Finally although physical activity and
dehydration in pregnancy have been associated with
a small increase in uterine contractions a sys
tematic review and meta analysis in normal weight preg
nant women with singleton uncomplicated gestations
demonstrated that exercise for minutes
times per week is not associated with an increased risk of
preterm birth or with a reduction in mean gestational age
at delivery

Special Populations
Pregnant Women With Obesity
Pregnant women with obesity should be encouraged to
engage in a healthy lifestyle modification in pregnancy
that includes physical activities and judicious diets
Women should start with low intensity short periods of
exercise and gradually increase the period or intensity of
exercise as they are able In recent studies examining the
effects of exercise among pregnant women with obesity
women assigned to exercise demonstrated modest reduc
tions in weight gain and no adverse outcomes

rate Competitive athletes require frequent and close
supervision because they tend to maintain a more stren
uous training schedule throughout pregnancy and
resume high intensity training postpartum sooner than
other women Such athletes should pay particular atten
tion to avoiding hyperthermia maintaining proper
hydration and sustaining adequate caloric intake to pre
vent weight loss which may adversely affect fetal growth
An elite athlete can be defined generally as an athlete
with several years of experience in a particular sport or
sports who has competed successfully against other high
level performers and trains year round at a high level an
elite athlete generally trains at least days per week
averaging close to hours per day throughout the year
In addition to aerobic training elite athletes in most
sports also participate in resistance training to increase
muscular strength and endurance however this training
was not considered a safe activity in early guidelines for
exercise during pregnancy because of potential injury
and possible fetal heart decelerations resulting from Val
salva maneuvers Consequently there is sparse literature
on this topic It is prudent for elite athletes who wish
to continue strenuous activity during pregnancy to have
a clear understanding of the risks to obtain approval
from their health care providers and to consider decreas
ing resistance load compared with prepregnant condi
tions High impact activities with increased risk of
blunt trauma should be avoided and it also is important
that the pregnant elite athlete avoid overheating when
performing their sport or participating in intense train
ing
Activity Restriction

evidence to prescribe bed rest in pregnancy for the
prevention of preterm labor and it should not be routinely
recommended Patients prescribed prolonged bed
rest or restricted physical activity are at risk of venous
Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period
most of the estimates of risk pointed to small or null
effects In contrast a cohort study of more than
Danish women reported a dose response relationship
between total daily burden lifted and preterm birth with
loads more than kg per day In this study
lifting heavy loads greater than kg more than
times per day was associated with an increased risk of
preterm birth
The National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health uses an equation that determines the
maximum recommended weight limit for lifting that
would be acceptable to of healthy women
This equation has been used to define recommended
weight limits for a broad range of lifting patterns for
pregnant women as well as lifting conditions that pose
a higher risk of musculoskeletal injury Fig
Obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers can use their best clinical judgment to
determine a recommended plan for the patient This
plan may include a formal request for an occupational
health professional to perform an analysis to deter
mine maximum weight limits based on actual lifting
condition or assist with writing appropriate letters to
employers to help obtain accommodations
Exercise in the Postpartum Period
Several reports indicate that women s level of participa
tion in exercise programs diminishes after childbirth
frequently leading to overweight and obesity
The postpartum period is an opportune time for
obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care pro
viders to recommend and reinforce a healthy lifestyle
Resuming exercise or incorporating new exercise rou
tines after delivery is important in supporting lifelong
healthy habits Exercise routines may be resumed grad
ually after pregnancy as soon as medically safe de
pending on the mode of delivery vaginal or cesarean
birth and the presence or absence of medical or surgical
complications Some women are capable of resuming
physical activities within days of delivery Pelvic floor
exercises can be initiated in the immediate postpartum
period Abdominal strengthening exercises including
abdominal crunch exercises and the drawing in exercise
a maneuver that increases abdominal pressure by pulling
in the abdominal wall muscles have been shown to
decrease the incidence of diastasis recti abdominus and
decrease the inter rectus distance in women who gave
birth vaginally or by cesarean birth
Regular aerobic exercise in lactating women has
been shown to improve maternal cardiovascular fitness
without affecting milk production composition or
infant growth Women who are lactating should
consider feeding their infants or expressing milk before
exercising to avoid discomfort of engorged breasts They
also should ensure adequate hydration before commenc
Conclusion
Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are associated
with minimal risks and have been shown to benefit most
women although some modification to exercise routines
may be necessary because of normal anatomic and
physiologic changes and fetal requirements In the
absence of obstetric or medical complications or contra
indications physical activity in pregnancy is safe and
desirable and pregnant women should be encouraged to
continue or to initiate safe physical activities
Obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should evaluate women with medical or
obstetric complications carefully before making recom
mendations on physical activity participation during
pregnancy Although the evidence is limited exercise
results in benefits to pregnancy outcomes and there is no
evidence of harm when exercise is not contraindicated
Physical activity and exercise during pregnancy promote
physical fitness and may prevent excessive gestational
weight gain Exercise may reduce the risk of gestational
diabetes preeclampsia and cesarean birth Additional
research is needed to study the effects of exercise on
pregnancy specific conditions and outcomes and to clar
ify further effective behavioral counseling methods and
the optimal type frequency and intensity of exercise
Similar research is needed to create an improved evi
dence base concerning the effects of occupational phys
ical activity on maternal fetal health

Background Being obese can lead to various complications during pregnancy such as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
GDM pregnancy induced hypertension PIH Pre Eclampsia PE and Large Gestational Age LGA Although bariatric
surgery is an effective way to treat obesity it can also result in complications and may be linked to having small for
gestational age SGA babies This cohort study protocol aims to compare the maternal and fetal neonatal outcomes of two
groups of Iranian pregnant women those who have undergone bariatric surgery and those who are obese but have not had
bariatric surgery Methods In this study Pregnant women weeks gestation n per group are recruited either
from one of the obesity clinic exposure group with a history of bariatric surgery or primary healthcare clinics in Tehran
city comparison group pregnant women with obesity and and no history of bariatric surgery Dietary intake and nutrient
status are assessed at and weeks Maternal and fetal neonatal outcomes are compared between the two
groups including gestational diabetes preeclampsia preterm labor intrauterine growth restriction severe nausea and
vomiting abortion placenta previa and abruption venous thrombosis vaginal bleeding cesarean delivery meconium
aspiration and respiratory distress Maternal serum levels of ferritin albumin zinc calcium magnesium selenium copper
vitamins A and hydroxy Vit D are checked during to weeks Maternal and neonatal outcomes
including height weight head circumference fetal abnormality infection small or large fetus low birth weight macrosomia
NICU admission and total weight gain during pregnancy are measured at birth Maternal and offspring outcomes including
weight height head circumference total weight gain during pregnancy newborn diseases postpartum bleeding
breastfeeding and related problems are assessed weeks after delivery Child s weight height and head circumference
are followed at and months after birth Maternal stress anxiety and depression are assessed with the
DASS questionnaire and physical activity is evaluated using the PPAQ questionnaire in the first and third trimesters
Discussion By assessing the levels of micronutrients in the blood of pregnant women along with the evaluation of
pregnancy outcomes it is feasible to gain a more accurate understanding of how bariatric surgery affects the health and
potential complications for both the mother and the fetus newborn This information can help specialists and patients make
more informed decisions about the surgery Additionally by examining issues such as stress anxiety and depression in
women undergoing surgery this study can contribute to recognizing these problems which can also affect pregnancy

Abstract This study is aimed at providing companies with de
cision support in selecting the most suitable production processes
for producing diverse customized products belonging to a family
in attempting to achieve production efficiency while utilizing the
available manufacturing resources One of the measurements of
best suitability is the similarity of production processes for
producing product family members If the production processes
are similar there will be fewer production changeovers This in
turn helps achieve not only efficiency but also product quality
We develop an integer linear formulation for the selection of
production routings for each member of a product family and
for the assignment of an execution mode to each operation in
each selected routing We report on computational experiments
with an illustrative example instance

I INTRODUCTION
The objective of this paper is to formulate a mathematical
model that determines an optimal production process for a
customized product belonging to a family i e process family
planning In this regard both representation as well as
selection of alternative production processes are required The
output includes specific operations or operations modes and
their precedence relationships i e operations precedence the
total processing time and the total production cost
In practice for producing a product a routing consists of
a number of operations and operations precedence It can
be implemented by a number of production process alter
natives each of which is formed by operations modes and
the corresponding operations precedence Companies typically
adopt only one production process to produce each product
in the hope of reducing the difficulties and complexities
in production on the shop floors l Different modes
of a same operation may differ in manufacturing resources
such as machines tools fixtures thus leading to different
processing times and costs In process family planning all the
production process alternatives for a given customized product
are compared with the production process being used on the
shop floor for producing other customized products belonging
to the same family In accordance with the differences in
routings and manufacturing resources production processes
are compared with respect to the routing and manufactur
ing resource similarities That is the total similarity of two
production processes includes the weighted routing similarity
and manufacturing resource similarity The higher the total
similarity between a production process alternative and the
existing one the fewer production changeovers will be needed
which in turn contributes to production stability reduced
production cost and product quality
The total production cost is the total cost for producing
the given customized product using the selected production
process Since the cost for each operations mode is known
the total production cost is the sum of the costs of operations
modes which form the selected production process The total
processing time is obtained as the maximum length duration
of any sequence of operations that cannot be processed in
parallel According to the above the objective has three
parts to maximize production similarity to minimize total
production cost and to minimize total processing time

binary relation Api C Qpi x Qpi transitive and
irreflexive and
the set of all alternative routings RPi for product p
Each operations precedence set Api is such that WI G A
if and only if the output of WI belongs to the input set of
In this paper we work with hierarchical BOM structures
where each operation only has one output as opposed to flat
or inverse BOMs which may have more than one identical
or distinct outputs Each routing has one unique end product
which is the unique output component p G P of the unique
maximal element of Q A O Consequently each graph
G Qpi Api is an in tree We also assume that each operation
appears at most once in each routing

Each mode m G M w has an associated cost cw

process alternative is a mapping of each operation w G

B Problem statement and a linear model
Our goal is to select a set of production processes each
of which is formed by specific operations modes and their
operations precedence to produce a given set of products
such that an optimal performance with respect to production
similarity total production cost and total processing time can
be achieved These three objectives similarity cost and time
may conflict with one another Thus we include a composite
similarity measure in the objective and relegate cost and time
to the constraints where we impose an upper bound Cp and
Tp on the total cost respectively time for product p
The problem to be solved can be captured by a linear model
with the following two sets of decision variables
xpz G xpz
iff routing Rpt is chosen for
product p and
iff operation w for product p is
executed in mode m so if arp w m
We also use the following additional parameters in the model
Q p C Q is the subset of operations that occur in at least
one routing for product p
iff operation w appears in
routing i for product p
iff operation w can be per
pzwm
pawm
formed in mode m in routing i for product p and
L p i C is the set of operation sets that corre
spond with an inclusion maximal path in graph
Consequently
iff there is at least one mode m such
that
pawm
The following constraint applies
iGRp
where i G Rp stands for Rpt G Rp This constraint implies
that exactly one routing will be chosen for each product

we need to enforce value upon

We also impose that exactly one mode be chosen for each
operation in the routing selected for product p as follows

This constraint also ensures that no mode is selected if w does
not appear in the selected routing

In this expression the term RS Rpz Rqj is independent of X

of the routing and the manufacturing similarity respectively
In this paper for illustrative simplicity these weights are
set as each In practice companies can decide on the
values of these two weights based on their own production
characteristics
C Complexity analysis
Consider the following decision problem
EVEN ODD PARTITION
Instance A finite set A
and a size
s a G N for each a G A
Question Is there a subset N C A such that s a
s a and A contains exactly one of ly I am for
aGA A
This problem is known to be NP complete It can be shown
that the feasibility question for the optimization problem
defined in Section II B is also NP complete For a given
instance of EVEN ODD PARTITION consider a single prod
uct p with only one routing IRpl such that n
and Qpl Apl is a complete order on QPI the precedence
graph is one chain of n operations Each operation Wi
i n has exactly two modes M w
and consider the following
Define Smax
maxi I
costs and durations for each operation under each mode
s Lil S
s Let B
and
Li l It can
Smax
be verified that a feasible mode assignment for the thus
constructed instance exists with C B and Tp
if and only if the answer to the corresponding PARTITION
instance is yes
This complexity result implies that a polynomial time algo
rithm for solving the problem does not exist unless P NP
which is generally assumed to be very unlikely We therefore
solve the integer linear formulation developed supra by means
of a mainstream linear solver
III NUMERICAL EXAMPLE AND DISCUSSION
We consider a numerical example where a product family
consists of three product variants P The
maximal allowable cost and time for producing each product
variant are as follows Cl Tl
and Each product variant has two routing
alternatives the routing sets for each product variant are de
noted by Rp RPI for p The routing graphs
G Qpi Api are included in Appendix A The set of operations
for producing the product family includes operations in
total some of which are the same Most operations can be
implemented by different sets of manufacturing resources
leading to specific operations modes and the corresponding
durations and costs Some modes for identical operations for
different products are also the same Further details are given
in the appendix
The linear formulation contains variables all binary
in total for the example instance and constraints It was
solved by Gurobi Solver called from Python
The experiment was run on a Dell OptiPlex with an
Intel Core processor and GB of RAM running
Ubuntu LTS The instance was solved in less than
seconds this indicates that the runtime for any instance
of comparable size will be negligible The optimal production
similarity equals With the current values for Cp and
Tp none of the budget and time constraints and is
binding so the optimal objective value would equal
even if constraints were simply removed
Figure examines the optimal production similarity for the
example instance as a function of the upper bounds on cost
and time In detail the right hand sides of the constraints
for all three products in Equation respectively are
simultaneously decreased by the value on the horizontal axis
in the plot in Figure respectively Figure We observe
that the optimal production similarity remains constant until
one of the constraints becomes binding after which there is
a steady decrease until the constraints become too restrictive
to admit a feasible solution which is where the plots end
The plot for the durations displays a similar pattern This
implies that restrictive budgets and limits on processing times

may launch product family members one by one In the future
therefore we intend to extend the model by taking into account
this situation From a more theoretical point of view we have
only shown NP hardness in the ordinary sense although we
suspect that the problem can also be shown to be strongly
NP hard In this regard showing either strong NP hardness or
developing a pseudo polynomial time algorithm is a subject
for future work as well Finally due to the complexity status
of the problem when the instances to be solved are of larger
size then it may be necessary to resort to heuristic procedures

I V CONCLUSION
This paper has introduced an optimization model to as
sist companies in planning production processes for diverse
customized products such that production efficiency can be
achieved by maintaining production as stable as possible
We have considered not only routing and manufacturing
resource similarities but also production time and cost The
optimization problem at hand turns out to be NP hard and
we have therefore employed a commercial solver to solve a
linear formulation of the problem We have reported our results
for a numerical example which demonstrates that our model
can provide decision making support in planning production
processes for product families
The optimization model has been developed by considering
the situation where all customized products belonging to a
family are launched at the same time In practice companies

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective This short communication demonstrates how short tandem repeat genotyping can identify
the origin of gestational choriocarcinoma
Materials and methods The origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in our three cases was determined
using the short tandem repeats genotyping technique which involved quantitative fluorescent PCR and
fragmentation analysis
Results In Case despite no medical history of molar pregnancy DNA analysis indicated that the
choriocarcinoma originated from a homozygous complete hydatidiform mole We conclude that the
patient s complete abortion years prior to the choriocarcinoma diagnosis was an undiagnosed com
plete hydatidiform mole In Case and Case the clinically presumed origin of choriocarcinoma was
confirmed
Conclusion Determining the origin of choriocarcinoma is essential for clinical application as it affects
the FIGO scoring system for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia which determines the patient s prog
nosis and treatment approach

choriocarcinoma is currently low because of its high chemo
sensitivity
Materials and methods
The origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in our three cases was
determined using the Short Tandem Repeats STR genotyping
technique which involved Quantitative Fluorescent PCR QF PCR
and fragmentation analysis Blood saliva and tissues from paraffin
blocks were used for DNA isolation with QIAGEN kits QF PCR was
performed using the GenePrint System Promega and Devyser
Extend Devyser commercial kits Capillary electrophoresis was
performed on ABI Prism and ABI Prism Genetic
Analyzer The recommended DNA concentration in reaction of
samples isolated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
were adjusted increased because of poor quality of DNA and
fragmentation The GeneMapperTM Software was used to
analyze the data
To interpret the obtained data two main tasks need to be per
formed First the genome composition needs to be determined by
Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology
comparing the STR allelic profiles of the choriocarcinoma and the
patient which allows the identification of the type of pregnancy
that gave rise to the cancer Abnormal genome compositions are
characteristic of molar pregnancies with complete hydatidiform
moles typically having two sets of paternal chromosomes Fig la
and c and partial hydatidiform moles having two sets of paternal
and one set of maternal chromosomes However biparental com
plete hydatidiform mole can have a physiological genome compo
sition which is a potential pitfall Non gestational choriocarcinoma
lacks identifiable paternal allelic sets Table
Matching the choriocarcinoma with a specific pregnancy based
on genetic analysis is important for determining both the type of
pregnancy that gave rise to the tumor and the time interval be
tween the end of the index pregnancy and treatment as illustrated

unfixed fresh frozen myometrium and the choriocarcinoma ChCa DNA isolated from unfixed fresh frozen tumor Asterisks indicate alleles of loci proving the absence of
maternal chromosomes in the nuclear genome of the tumor All loci of the choriocarcinoma contain only one STR allele what suggest monospermic complete mole

ChCa DNA isolated from paraffine block and the infant DNA isolated from saliva STR allelic profiles of the choriocarcinoma and the infant are identical proving the origin of the
tumor In the tumor tissue characteristic vascular space invasion and necrosis can lead to a certain amount of contamination with maternal blood what can be seen on electro
phoretograms as minor maternal spikes Taken together with the DNA fragmentation caused by formalin fixation allelic imbalances may occur

the same allele was in both copies inherited from the father This can be the result of either the homozygosity of the father for this concrete allele or the same allele was inherited

underwent a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo oophorectomy
and DNA was isolated from the unfixed tissue of the myometrium
and the tumor DNA analysis showed that the tumor choriocar
cinoma had an androgenetic composition of the genome was ho
mozygous in all examined loci and had a gonosome complement
XX indicating that it originated from a homozygous mono
spermic complete hydatidiform mole The patient s complete
abortion years prior to the choriocarcinoma diagnosis was found
to be an undiagnosed complete hydatidiform mole with a long
interval to malignant transformation

Case
A year old patient GI PI presented with bleeding two
months after giving birth to a live born boy Curettage was per
formed and gestational choriocarcinoma was detected based on
ultrasound suspicion and histopathology DNA was extracted from
the patient s peripheral blood microdissected formalin fixed
paraffin embedded tumor tissue and the infant s saliva DNA anal

identical STR allelic profiles in the tumor and infant confirming the
origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in the pregnancy ended up

analysis the complete hydatidiform mole was proved to be dis
permic with gonosomal complement X Y In the vaginal excision

mole and the patient were detected proving the origin of gesta
tional choriocarcinoma in the above mentioned mole Fig lc
Discussion
STR genotyping can provide clinically significant information for
gestational choriocarcinoma cases
Genetic analysis revealed misdiagnosed complete hydatidiform
mole in Case The patient got point less in the FIGO scoring
system Supplemental Table what did not change the stratification
of the patient in this particular case she stayed in the high risk
group
In Case the gestational choriocarcinoma originated from a
term birth and genetic analysis was crucial in excluding any un
recognized pregnancies In Case a metastatic gestational
choriocarcinoma developed just two weeks after the evacuation
because of the malignant transformation of a dispermic complete
hydatidiform mole highlighting the highly aggressive nature of
these lesions
According to a study recently published by Jung et al copy
neutral loss of heterozygosity CN LOH and copy number al
terations CNAs are key molecular characteristics in gestational
choriocarcinomas arising from complete hydatidiform moles
CN LOH occurs in homozygous monospermic complete hyda
tidiform moles on a whole genome level because of the dupli
cation of a haploid set of chromosomes in one sperm like in our
Case The CN LOH pattern seen in heterozygous dispermic
complete hydatidiform moles is typically segmental what is
attributable to two independent meiotic events of the two
sperms fertilizing the ovum like in our Case According to the
above mentioned study malignant transformation of complete
moles into choriocarcinoma may happen by the accumulation of
CNAs
Using STR genotyping is possible to differentiate between
monospermic homozygous and dispermic heterozygous com
plete moles Finding out whether the complete mole is heterozy
gous or homozygous in clinical practice only points to a higher risk
of malignancy in the case of a heterozygous complete mole but
does not predict malignancy The close follow up of the hCG tumor
marker and the patient s clinical condition remains crucial
According to the FIGO scoring system the source of choriocar
cinoma is the antecedent last pregnancy DNA analysis can reveal
that this was not the case and that the choriocarcinoma did not
come from the last pregnancy but from the previous one This can
change the scoring system the number of points not only for the
pregnancy preceding choriocarcinoma but also for the interval from
the antecedent pregnancy Ultimately this can change the patient
stratification from low risk to high risk or vice versa which also
changes the chemotherapeutic approach monochemotherapy
polychemotherapy
In summary STR genotyping is an efficient and accurate method
for identifying the origin of both gestational and non gestational
choriocarcinoma Fresh frozen tissue is the preferred sample type
but formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples are also acceptable
The genotypes of the patient tumor and previous pregnancies are
compared to determine the type and time interval from the end of
the index pregnancy both of which are important for prognosis and
treatment It s worth noting that the last pregnancy may not always
be the source of gestational choriocarcinoma and occult non
diagnosed molar nonmolar pregnancies can also contribute to
this malignancy According to our experiences the described
molecular diagnostic method is economically manageable costs
L Gergely V Repiska R Petrovic et al
approximately as other standard laboratory diagnostic methods in
Slovakia In clinical practice identifying the origin of choriocarci
noma can change the FIGO score and optimize the chemotherapy
regimen

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objectives Family planning is a cornerstone to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals How
ever men s involvement in family planning has been a challenge in many countries This study aimed to
investigate the participation of men in the family planning programs and related factors from the per
spective of women referring to family planning organizations in Herat Afghanistan
Methods The study had a cross sectional design The participants of the study consisted of married
women aged years selected by simple random sampling The data collection tool was a valid and
reliable questionnaire to assess the participation of men in family planning programs To analyze the data
descriptive statistics and analytical methods including Mann Whitney and Pearson Chi Square tests were
applied in SPSS The answers to the open end questions were analyzed coded and classified in two
main categories
Results The average age of study participants was years and a significant proportion of them
were illiterate Most of the participants were housewives and their husbands were non
professional workers The husbands participated in family planning programs by choosing the
type of contraception provision of contraceptives and supporting their wives using them
There were statistically significant relationships between women s and their husband s education
level and husband s employment status with the type of participation in family planning The main in
centives for Afghan men to participate family planning were the increased attention of families to the
education and needs of children and the health and welfare of the wives However cultural norms sup
porting larger families the desire for having boy children the fear of contraception s side effects and
religious prohibitions discourage them in using family planning methods
Conclusion A large number of the respondents stated that their spouse participated in family planning
programs It shows the importance and success of family planning centers in promoting sexual and re
productive health and family planning Study showed that various factors affected men s participation in
family planning programs Recognition of these factors can help policy makers in designing behavioral
interventions based on social marketing and enhancing the effectiveness of these programs
One of the most important areas of population policies is hu
man reproduction Family planning has been a part of most socio
economic development plans around the world in recent years

formed choices about the number of children and the timing and

Cies and the need for abortion WHO
The International Conference on Population and Development
Cairo addressed this important issue According to this con
ference sexual and reproductive health programs should have a
couple oriented approach and not only focus on women but also
persuade men to fulfill their responsibilities Men by having im
portant roles in the family and society can be the determinants
of family planning programs success Simbar and helpful
in the promotion of women and children s health Simbar et al
In this conference the concept of men s participation was
defined as supporting the wife in receiving pregnancy care fam
ily planning and preserving sexual and reproductive health In fact
the participation of men means fulfilling their responsibilities in
supporting the spouse to deal with the diffculties of sexual life
childbearing and choosing and using contraception methods WHO
So far most family planning activities and studies have fo
cused on women and little attention has been paid to the role of
men
Chigozie and Messias Davis et al
Afghanistan is located within South and Central Asia With per
capita GDP of this country is ranked as a low income
country World Bank Annual population growth rate of
Afghanistan was in Wold Bank The effective
and successful implementation of family planning programs can
play an important role in the country s sustainable development
Starbird et al and as mentioned this will not happen with
out the participation of men and women Studying men s partici
pation and related factors is essential for planning and implement
ing interventions to improve the level and quality of participation
Considering the cultural context of Afghanistan and the predomi
nance of men s decisions in the family and the fact that according
to the Afghanistan s law polygamy is allowed Monsutti It
is especially important to involve them in the use of contraceptive
methods According to Shafiqollah et al the awareness of Afghans
about contraceptive methods is satisfactory but the contraceptive
prevalence is low Shafiqullah et al There is a knowledge
gap about men s participation in family planning programs in this
country The purpose of this study was to investigate the partici
pation of men in family planning programs from the perspective of
women in Afghanistan
Methods
This study has a cross sectional design The study population
included married women aged years who referred to the
clinics of Marie Stopes Institute in Herat city of Afghanistan in
Herat is the capital city of Herat province located in the west
of Afghanistan With a population of people in this
city was the fourth populated city in Afghanistan World Popula
tion Review Marie Stopes is a foreign NGO providing fam
ily planning and contraceptive services in Afghanistan It has two
clinics in Herat The population of the city has acceptable access to
these two clinics
Zwi et al
Based on the following formula due to the lack of similar stud
ies regarding the participation rate of men in the family planning
program in Afghanistan the participation rate p of has been
taken into account which by considering the first type error a of
the power of the test as and the accuracy d as
the sample size was estimated to be
Midwifery
Considering that the number of referrals to two clinics of Marie
Stopes Institute was almost equal the sample was se
lected equally from each clinic Sampling was done in four differ
ent weeks in four different months It was performed in all days
of each week and in three different times per day including early
working hours of the clinics samples mid hours samples
and the end of working hours samples Each time samples
were selected randomly according to the order of their arrival at
the clinic
To collect data a questionnaire which had been made and used
in a similar study by Pouransary et al was used Pouransary et al
The mentioned study aimed to determine the use of differ
ent methods of contraception among women of Iranshahr a dis
trict in southeast of Iran near the border of Iran Afghanistan and
the rate of their husbands participation in family planning The
validity of the questionnaire was confirmed according to the opin
ions of experts by calculating the content validity ratio CVR
The reliability of the questionnaire was examined by the test retest
method in a pilot study on samples with a week interval be
tween the two tests According to the calculated intraclass corre
lation coeffcient ICC of the reliability of the questionnaire
was confirmed Pouransary et al Because the offcial lan
guage of both countries Iran and Afghanistan was the same there
was no need for translating the questionnaire and only terminol
ogy edit was done by a person who was familiar with two dialects
of Persian Farsi and Dari However in order to ensure the con
tent validity of the questionnaire in the context of Afghanistan the
questionnaire was assessed and approved by a number of Afghan
experts in reproductive health and family planning programs
The questionnaire consisted of three parts In the first part de
mographic characteristics of the women participating in the study
and their spouses were asked The second part consisted of two
questions In the first question each participant was asked about
the status of her spouse s participation in family planning in the
form of a four choice question Lack of any cooperation Se
lection and cooperation in choosing the method of contraception
Preparation of contraceptives Supporting and reminding the
correct and effective use of the method In this case the respon
dents could choose more than one answer In the second question
the participants were asked to indicate their satisfaction with the
contraception method in a four choice Likert scale very satisfied
relatively satisfied neither agree nor disagree relatively
dissatisfied and dissatisfied The third part of the ques
tionnaire was about what encourages and discourages Afghan men
to participate in family planning
To analyze the data descriptive statistical methods including
percentage and mean as well as analytical methods including
Mann Whitney and Pearson Chi square tests were used Data anal
ysis was performed using SPSS software version Moreover the
answers to open end questions were analyzed coded and classified
in two main categories
Results
In the study of Afghan men s participation in family planning
programs from the perceptive of their wives response rate was

their spouses are shown in Table According to this table spouses
were on average years older than their wives Nearly half of par
ticipants were illiterate The proportion of spouses with academic
degrees was about twice that of female participants On average
men were more educated than women

Discussion
About of Afghan women use contraceptives according to
the report of UNFPA Afghanistan In this country women should
ask the permission of their husbands to use contraceptives that
shows the important role of Afghan men in family planning
Studies show that the success of family planning is
UNFPA
dependent to the involvement of men and women Berhane et al
However in less developed countries husband s participa
tion in family planning is low and men consider it a women s is
sue A study in Malawi indicated that targeting men in family plan
ning programs resulted in considerable increase of contraceptive
use Shattuck et al
Table
Factors that encourage or discourage the participation of Afghan men in family planning
Midwifery
The present study indicates that men had interest in participat
ing in family planning programs in Afghanistan as more than
of women declared it Considering the low level of contraceptive
use in this country the findings of the study show the importance
and success of family planning centers in promoting sexual and
reproductive health and family planning A study in Jordan
showed that although more than of studied men knew about
family planning reported that they used contraceptives More
over believed that both husband and wife should decide about
family planning Mansour et al In Kenya of men in
Nigeria and in Senegal reported to be using modern con
traceptives Okigbo et al Study by Nurfaizah et al demon
strated that male participation in family planning was low in In
donesia Moreover men s knowledge of family planning and repro
ductive health social values culture and attitudes affected their
participation in family planning For the implementation of FP pro
grams they suggested that communication education and cooper
ation of religious leaders and stakeholders and public and private
sector authorities were essential Nurfaizah et al
In our study that focuses on the couples referring to special
health facilities designated for providing family planning services
a large number of men supported their wives to use family plan
ning however not all of them were willing to buy contraceptives
This might be related to the cultural factors e g men are dissuad
ing to seek information on family planning and reproductive and
sexual health UNFPA In Iran men usually make decisions
on using family planning and type of contraception for the couple
Nabavi et al Their participation in family planning pro
grams differs across the country In a study in Iran men reported
the fear of side effects of contraceptives and one third of them
showed the sense of male domination and behavior based on tra
ditional stereotypes of gender roles Ghiasi and Karimi
In a study in Malawi socio economic factors were recognized as
influential in men s involvement in FP Accessibility of the methods
and affordability of contraceptives were influenced by those fac
tors

My husband and I are not sure about the future I
am afraid to send my children to school because of
insecurity and conflict in the country
In current economic situation large families have
difficulties to meet their children needs They
cannot afford sending their children particularly the
girls to school they choose to marry off them in a
young age
I want to continue my education and my husband
agrees with me to postpone pregnancy
Family planning services are mostly provided in
women s section in hospitals that men are not
allowed to enter Moreover midwives and female
doctors are not allowed to provide family planning
counselling to men They give information to
women and they share it with their husbands
Contraceptives are harmful for our health
My husband likes to have boys and girls
My husband agreed birth spacing but we think
permanent sterilization is a sin
They think Allah is the determinant of child bearing
and people should not interfere in his decision
People think it is a shame not to have children
particularly boys
H Shabanikiya A Darman V Ghavami et al
volved more in FP Oyediran et al found that the age and edu
cation of the husbands number of living children and receiving
information from family planning providers were the principal de
terminants of men s involvement Oyediran et al All these
factors had statistically significant relationships with male partici
pation in our study too Kamal et al studied the factors influencing
men involvement in FP in Bangladesh and found that male involve
ment was percent in the studied area and women s level of
education had a direct effect on FP use that supports the finding
of our study Kamal et al In Kamal et al study as couple
aged the use of contraceptives increased but the present study re
vealed an opposite situation since younger couples intended to use
contraceptives and involved in FP more
The support of married Afghan men to use FP methods in this
study was more than a study in Ethiopia Kassa et al The
study by Dewi illustrated that men can keep important roles by
giving support in using family planning and also during the preg
nancy period of their wives These findings are consistent with
the findings of the present study Dewi Less than
of studied men did not participate in family planning program
at all Supporting and reminding were the most frequent types
of participation and preparing the contraception the least fre
quent one Moreover women whose spouses participated in family
planning program were significantly p more satisfied than
those whose spouses did not participate Women receiving support
are more probable to continue using family planning In this study
the number of children in families that husbands did not partici
pate in family planning was significantly p higher than the
other group that is similar to what Overdiran found in his study
Oyediran et al
According to this study the factors that encouraged men to
participate in family planning were the concerns about the fu
ture of children and the health and welfare of the mothers How
ever cultural norms supporting larger families the desire for hav
ing boy children the fear of contraception s side effects and reli
gious prohibitions discouraged them in using FP These results are
in line with the exploratory qualitative study conducted by USAID
to identify factors that influence use of family planning methods
at the individual couple family service accessibility socio cultural
and policy environment for improvement of contraceptive use in
Afghanistan USAID Shafiqollah et al also pointed out some
factors such as religious prohibitions and cultural norms as incen
tives for Afghans not to sought FP Shafiqullah et al
Conclusion
The aim of this study was to determine men s participa
tion in family planning from the perspectives of their wives in
Afghanistan The results indicate that men have interest in fam
ily planning in this country Several factors affect the participation
of men in such programs Younger couples the ones with higher
income and education reported higher degree of male participa
tion in family planning They supported their wives in the use of
contraceptives more than other groups Recognition of these fac
tors can help policy makers in designing behavioral interventions
A couple oriented approach to family planning would be helpful
The factors that discourage men to participate family planning
need to be addressed About religious prohibitions talking with
clergies might help By prioritizing children s education and the
welfare of wives by new generation the cultural norms about
larger families will change in future By providing information
about family planning particularly to young people the use of con
traceptives will increase in this country However the aim of such
activities should not necessarily be decreasing the size of popula
tion but the fulfilment of people sexual and reproductive rights
Midwifery
Limitations of the study
In this study women were asked about the participation of
their husbands that might be different with the opinion of their
husbands So our findings should be interpreted with caution The
other limitation was that the study population was women refer
ring to family planning centers So the results cannot be general
ized to all Afghan women Still with these limitations this study
provides useful insights for policy makers in Afghanistan to better
implement family planning programs

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Child and maternal health a key marker of overall health system performance is a policy priority
area by the World Health Organization and the United Nations including the Sustainable Development Goals
Previous realist work has linked child and maternal health outcomes to globalization political tradition and the
welfare state It is important to explore the role of other key policy related factors This paper presents a realist
synthesis categorising policy instruments according to the established NATO model to develop an explanatory
model of how policy instruments impact child and maternal health outcomes
Methods A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies assessing the relationships between
policy instruments and child and maternal health outcomes Data were analysed using a realist framework The
first stage of the realist analysis process was to generate micro theoretical initial programme theories for use in
the theory adjudication process Proposed theories were then adjudicated iteratively to produce a set of final
programme theories
Findings From a total of unique records records proceeded to full text screening and papers were
included in the review Evidence from studies was available to address this research question Studies were
published from to assessed a single country and analysed data at the ecological level
Eighty eight initial candidate programme theories were generated Following theory adjudication five final
programme theories were supported According to the NATO model these were related to treasure organisation
authority treasure and treasure organisation instrument types
Conclusions This paper presents a realist synthesis to develop an explanatory model of how policy instruments
impact child and maternal health outcomes from a large systematically identified international body of evi
dence Five final programme theories were supported showing how policy instruments play an important yet
context dependent role in influencing child and maternal health outcomes
Linking political factors to child and maternal health
Politics has been defined as the practice of the art and science of
administering states

Pinzon Florez et al Moreover reducing maternal mortality by
and achieving universal access to reproductive health were key
elements of Millennium Development Goal which were not met in
despite considerable progress World Bank This relates to the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Good health and
well being in particular Target which aims to reduce the global
maternal mortality ratio to less than per live births and
Target which aims to end all preventable deaths under five years of
age and keep neonatal mortality in all countries to below per
live births and under mortality to below per live births
intended to be achieved by United Nations General Assembly
Meanwhile the American Public Health Association has identi
fied the importance of sociological factors in determining child health
outcomes and addressing this as important to achieve health equity
American Public Health Association
A previous realist review Barnish et al considered four po
litical exposures democracy welfare state provision political tradition
and globalisation in relation to child and maternal health outcomes
Especially in more developed countries left of centre political tradition
generated a greater focus on welfare state measures contributing to
reduced child mortality and low birth weight while a more generous
welfare state improved social conditions contributing to reductions in
infant and maternal mortality In lower and middle income countries
LMICs increased globalisation led to increased international trade
dependency and increased influence of multinational corporations and
international trade organisations contributing to increased child and
infant mortality and youth smoking rates This provided greater insight
into understanding the extent to which different political exposures
could affect child and maternal health outcomes In this paper we
address a gap identified in this work to examine the roles and in
teractions of policy instruments on child and maternal health This ad
vances the understanding of how a broader range of policy level
exposures relate to these outcomes and what mechanisms may operate
Relevant theoretical perspectives
Realist synthesis Pawson et al is an approach to evidence
synthesis that facilitates moving beyond descriptive analysis to offer a
theoretically informed explanatory insight into how the effects identi
fied in a body of evidence may operate The theoretical insights garnered
through realist synthesis are conceptualised in terms of programme
theories which are composed of context mechanism outcome configu
rations CMOs The theoretical lens of realist synthesis is based on the
epistemological foundations of critical realism
A realist
Bhaskar
synthesis culminates in a context specific and temporally sensitive
middle range theory enabling the understanding of a wide range of
intermingling relations between contexts and mechanisms that lead to
favourable or unfavourable population health outcomes
A number of macro theoretical perspectives may inform consider
ations around the relationship between politics and population health
Key relevant political theories include neoliberalism
Mirowski and
dependency theory
and socialist and
Piehwe
James
social democratic theories Bailey Lamb and Docherty In
the context of democracy political tradition welfare state provision and
globalisation in relation to child and maternal health it was found that
the realist programme theories supported by the evidence base aligned
most closely with macro theoretical perspectives within the broadly
socialist sphere Barnish et al
In addition to the above political exposures there are further theo
retical perspectives relevant to population health which are specifically
appertaining to policy instruments

resources nodality authority treasure and organization or NATO in
Social Science Medicine
Hood s terminology that can be used by governments to address policy
problems see also the table below In this study the NATO model is
used to analyse the targets of interventional tools and the relation be
tween tools and goals of the interventions Nodality refers to informa
tion advantage through the centrality of the government in various
networks authority refers to the legal power of the government to
command regulate or delegate to achieve goals treasure refers to a
wide variety of financial incentives and mechanisms such as the ability
to demand taxes or fund initiatives and organizational instruments
involve the deployment of resources to form organisations and markets
and provide goods and services such as through the deployment of
personnel to improve operational performance or structure see
Table
While there are a variety of instrument classifications available
Pal
such as the approaches taken by Linder and Peters
Salamon Stewart and Vedung
the NATO frame

Hood
offers the advantages of being a widely used
long established approach using four broad analytical categories
Aims of the current work
Much about what has been written on the programmatic innovation
and health system strengthening efforts to improve maternal and child
health outcomes understand these efforts as either top down reform or
bottom up strategy involving a limited number of actors and in
stitutions These innovations and efforts often comprise a spectrum of
strategies that involve the deployment of a single instrument or multiple
instruments packaged together in a single reform initiative In addition
the implementation mechanisms of these initiatives can be far more
intricate involving multiple actors and institutions working either
uniformly synergistically or antagonistically The understanding of
tools and implementation mechanisms in these reform initiatives that
strengthen child and maternal health has not been studied extensively
to the best of our knowledge Moreover existing policy evaluations in
this area have tended to be successionist and descriptive while the field
would benefit from a shift to a generative realist approach that provides
an explanatory account Thus the current work synthesises evidence
linking policy instruments analysed using the NATO model Hood
to child and maternal health outcomes

The following bibliographic databases were searched in March
to identify studies
MEDLINE ALL Ovid
APA Psyclnfo Ovid
Health Management Information Consortium Ovid
Global Health Ovid
Social Policy and Practice Ovid
Web of Science Clarivate Analytics
International Bibliography of the Social Sciences ProQuest
The search strategies were developed by an information specialist
following a discussion with the project lead The information specialist
conducted all searches starting with database searches followed by
supplementary searches and citation chasing
Database searches comprised terms for women and children terms
for different policy political exposures both general terms and terms
related to policy instruments to ensure coverage and terms for health
services and disparities No study type filters or date limits were used
but results were limited to the English language To increase specificity
a search for expected outcomes was also added using likely outcomes as
identified in a prior realist review on political factors in relation to child
and maternal health Barnish et al The full search strategy can
be found in Appendix A
The search process was iterative Relevant references from the initial
realist review were used as a test set to ensure they were captured in the
final search results Different subject headings and keywords were tested
systematically to identify which of these captured the full test set and
which excluded some papers to achieve an optimum balance of sensi
tivity and specificity
The search results were exported to Endnote Thomson Reuters
NY USA and de duplicated using automatic checking Items included
after full text screening were forward and backward citation chased
using Scopus Elsevier and Web of Science Clarivate to identify
additional relevant studies
First and last author searches were conducted on a pilot selection of
key papers in Scopus Since in all cases the corresponding author was
either the first or last author separate corresponding author searches
were not required Searches of included studies and key identified re
views were also conducted
Title and abstract screening were initially conducted by one
reviewer and a independent screening check was performed by a
second reviewer Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion be
tween the initial two reviewers involving two further senior team
members as required Potentially relevant records proceeded to full text
review which was initially conducted by one reviewer with a
Social Science Medicine
independent screening check by a second reviewer Any discrepancies
were resolved by discussion involving two further senior team members
as required
Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and a inde
pendent check was conducted by a second reviewer Any disagreements
were resolved by discussion involving two further senior team members
as appropriate Data were extracted onto a standardised form designed
to capture the following information Bibliographic details country
countries of study methodology Ssmple size sampling frame years of
study exposure measure outcome measure results information to help
develop programme theories When deciding which results to extract all
key study findings relevant to the review question were extracted with a
focus on narrative results that could enrich theory development and
adjudication rather than quantitative effect sizes and p values as used to
inform meta analyses
Level of development was categorised into a binary classification of
developed countries vs LMICs whereby countries on the World Bank
high income list World Bank undated a were classified as developed
and countries on the World Bank low income World Bank undated b
and middle income World Bank
undated c lists were classified as
LMICs Since this study used realist methods no formal assessment of
the risk of bias was undertaken
Realist analysis
The first stage of the realist analysis process was to generate micro
theoretical initial programme theories for use in the theory adjudica
tion process Realist initial programme theory development is typically
an iterative process informed by a defined set of sources of knowledge
which can include textual sources discussions broader epistemological
and theoretical perspectives applicable to the broad field of study and
the authors subject knowledge To ensure a broad range of perspectives
were taken into account included studies were each randomly assigned
to one of four reviewers with different disciplinary backgrounds
Through engagement with the assigned study as well as broader in
formation from the body of studies as a whole and relevant theoretical
perspectives the four reviewers formed initial programme theories via a
process of open coding
These initial programme theories were first dimensionalised i e
related to each other across studies to understand similarities and dif
ferences by two reviewers in the context of policy instruments applying
the NATO model
They were then iteratively discussed and
Hood
adjudicated in a series of team meetings
Theory adjudication i e which theories around the intervention
seem to fit best Rycroft Malone et al was performed separately
for each programme theory Coding was conducted manually For this
process studies were divided in a ratio between two reviewers and
the results of this adjudication were verified and refined through itera
tive rounds of discussion at meetings attended by all four reviewers The
process involved an overall assessment of the consistency of findings i
e assessment of demi regularities in outcome patterns by
context mechanism combinations in the direction that would support
the programme theory Consistency and strength of evidence were
assessed by discussion among the team taking into account how many
studies were available how many of the studies had broadly comparable
findings and the geographical profile of the findings Then a more
detailed assessment of studies for which the findings were in the di
rection that would support the programme theory was conducted This
enabled the precise context mechanism and outcome configuration to be
tested and refined The concept of mechanism was defined as per
Falleti
portable concepts that explain how and why a hy
and Lynch
pothesized cause in a given context contributes to a particular
outcome Since many studies incorporated countries at different levels
of development it was not feasible to stratify the analysis by level of
development

Theory adjudication
After further iteration and integration of candidate programme
theories as part of the theory adjudication process four candidate CMO
domains were considered to be well supported by the evidence base
Two of these were single instrument candidate CMOs domains treasure
and organisation while two were multi instrument configurations
authority treasure and treasure organisation Treasure appeared overall
to be the most frequently supported domain at this stage in the analysis
Within the single instrument treasure domain support was greatest with
regard to expenditure on health and or social services both improve
ments in outcomes associated with increased investment and deterio
ration in outcomes associated with austerity measures and cash transfer
programmes Within the single instrument organisation domain sup
port was greatest for overall health system improvements integration
and strengthening and focused health interventions for child and
maternal health including in the community Nodality based ap
proaches were not among the best supported
After the best supported candidate CMO domains were identified

Ashiabi et al Bishai et al and Langnel and Buracom
found that in an LMIC context increased public expenditure on
health led to lower child mortality rates through an improvement in
health service provision and access but this effect depended on coun
tries having sufficient governance to facilitate administrative capacity
On a related theme
Behera and Dash
found that in Southeast
Asian countries increased public health expenditure showed positive
effects on the reduction of infant mortality achieved through the
mechanism of improved government effectiveness to expand healthcare
facilities Furthermore
found that governmental

from to
Factor and Kang did not find a direct rela
tionship between health expenditure and health outcomes once other
factors such as level of economic development regime autocracy and
corruption had been considered suggesting these may be important
determinants of child and maternal health outcomes
Taking a different perspective Nyamuranga and Shin iden
tified immunization female literacy improved water sources and
reduced HIV prevalence as mechanisms for the impact of increased
health expenditure on the reduction of infant and under mortality in
LMICs Considering countries from to
Kim and Lane
found further evidence supporting the beneficial impact of
increased health expenditures on infant mortality and life expectancy at
birth While many studies focused on health expenditures Bradley et al
found that in OECD countries an increased ratio of social relative
to health expenditures was predictive of better outcomes in infant
mortality life expectancy and increased potential life years lost after
adjusting for the level of health expenditures and GDP Goldstein et al
found that increased spending on environmental educational
and infant mortality all reduced infant mortality the impact being
greatest with lower maternal age
identified that
Hall et al
especially in lower income contexts increased financial investment is
linked with rapid impacts on under five and maternal mortality through
improvements in government spending on health and infrastructure and
improved household spending while conversely government debt
refinancing or tax incentives may lead to short term worsening in health
due to a reduced ability to spend at both household and government
levels Focusing on more specific types of increased investment
Haji
zadeh et al demonstrated the benefit of paid maternity leave on
childhood vaccination uptake in a sample of LMICs Also in a
lower income context in Burkina Faso
Meda et al
did not find
evidence for the influence of a fee subsidy policy for deliveries and
emergency obstetric and neonatal care on neonatal mortality rates
although institutional deliveries themselves were increased In a
high income context
found that
Susan Marquis and Long
expanding public insurance led to better health outcomes for women
through improved access to maternal care services while a maternal and
child health services block grant facilitated reduced infant mortality
Margolis et al
Considering the authority treasure domain further certain studies
offered insight into favourable treasury policies that lack enforcement
stated that governmental
Gitobu et al
In a Kenyan context
policy to waive delivery charges in public health facilities did not
improve maternal survival or influence the causes of maternal mortality
Also in a Kenyan context
found that a delivery
Gitobu et al
Social Science Medicine
charge waiver policy in public health facilities statistically significantly
increased the number of facility based deliveries but this did not
convert into a significant reduction in maternal or neonatal mortality
After adjusting for patient characteristics
Taylor et al
in a
Medicaid non expansion state in the US did not find an association be
tween Medicaid status at delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes
Urquieta Salomon et al identified increased utilisation of health
services and increase in health equity as potential mechanisms for the
beneficial impact of universal health insurance legislation on maternal
and child health
Furthermore certain studies showed how authority mechanisms
bolstered the deployment of treasury tools
Irish et al
found that
changes to the treasure related instrument of parental leave imple
mented based on authority mechanisms in a high income context are
associated with diffuse maternal and child health outcomes Improve
ments in income and family bonding were identified as mechanisms but
outcomes also depended on the context of family resilience and eco
found that reform of Austrian
nomic status
Ahammer et al
maternity leave legislation in to extend compulsory prenatal leave
did not improve children s health at birth or long term health
Tanaka
identified adequate payment and job protection as key de
terminants of the success of parental leave policies on child health
outcomes in a panel of OECD countries from to as they
facilitate parental leave taking behaviour Turning to a low and
middle income context
also found little evi
Jahagirdar et al
dence that changes in legislated paid maternity leave were sufficient to
affect child height for age It was considered that the relatively short
duration of legislated leave potential low coverage and increases in
child growth in this particular setting may explain these findings
Final programme theory
Austerity measures especially in LICs and areas of greater socioeco
nomic deprivation led to worse perinatal outcomes life expectancy at
birth and child mortality through weakened social protection NATO
policy instrument domain treasure
Three studies examined the impact of austerity programmes In a
high income context
found that large budget cuts in
Rajmil et al
education health and other public services resulted in adverse trends in
perinatal outcomes low birth weight and infant mortality and the so
Cial determinants of health child poverty rates and severe material
deprivation in families with primary age children potentially due to
weakened social protection while
showed the
Alexiou et al
disproportionate impact of funding cuts on life expectancy at birth in
more socially deprived areas of England Considering a sample of
countries at different levels of economic development Maruthappu et al
showed that reductions in government healthcare spending led
to increased child mortality with the impact being greater in
low income countries
This provides a consistent finding across Alexiou et al and
Maruthappu et al
that the adverse impact of austerity pro
grammes is greater in the context of greater socio economic deprivation
From a related perspective Kayode et al found that irregular and
insufficient funding and lack of sufficient monitoring and evaluation
were some of the biggest implementation challenges for policies to
strengthen maternal care
Final programme theory
Conditional cash transfer programmes especially with adequate
community participation and a strong nutritional component in LMICs
led to improved child growth and anthropometric outcomes and
reduced infant mortality through strengthened household financial se
curity and empowerment to access health services NATO policy in
strument domains treasure and treasure organisation
It was noted that cash transfer programmes were primarily studied in
an LMIC context as would be expected given their particular relevance
in this economic context Empowering people to access health services
M S Barnish et al
especially where the cash transfer programme has a strong nutritional
component was identified by studies focusing on CCTs as a mechanism
for the positive impact of cash transfer programme participation on
child growth and anthropometric outcomes as well as infant mortality
reduction This potential mechanism was reinforced by Rasella et al
which showed that an increased income as a result of a CCT
programme can improve access to food and health related services
facilitating a reduction in under mortality
Sanchez et al
further reinforces the value of CCTs for improving nutritional status
while
Grellety et al
emphasise strengthened financial security
for vulnerable households as a mechanism by which these gains may be
achieved Behaviour change may be another mechanism by which cash
transfer programmes achieve their benefit This is related to strength
ened financial security since this security may in turn enable people to
change their health related behaviours De Andrade et al found
that CCTs led to decreased leprosy incidence in individuals under
years old potentially through enhancing early detection and prompt
treatment of cases reducing transmission occurrence of disabilities and
negative social consequences due to leprosy while
Cluver et al
found that cash transfers can reduce HIV adolescence among adolescent
girls through reducing risk behaviours The importance of ensuring
adequate participation in cash transfer programmes was shown by a
study from Brazil Labrecque et al which showed a negative
association between conditional cash transfer CCT programme
participation and child length and weight for age in the context of low
participation rates in the CCT However it is important to note incon
sistent evidence for the benefit of CCT programmes with Lopez Arana
showing a positive impact on thinness but not the more

prevalent outcome of stunting in Colombia Mascie Taylor et al
showed that a cash for work programme in Bangladesh improved
childhood nutritional status and associated anthropometric status
through facilitating greater household expenditure on food and conse
quent consumption of more protein rich food
Shaefer et al
considered the opposite direction of effect assessing the negative impact
of the decline of cash assistance in a US context in a state level analysis
from to It was found that the decline of cash assistance
increased household food insecurity and child homelessness among
those in state education with the reduction in financial means espe

benefit was limited by women not spending the money in the intended
Randive et al showed that the impact of a cash incen
manner
tive programme in India was differential according to the level of area
deprivation leading to increased inequality despite improved maternal
health outcomes emphasising the need for more targeted interventions
Barber and Gertler and Perez Lu et al both emphasised
the importance of system co ordination for successful CCTs noting that
both treasure and organisation elements have an important role to play
Final programme theory
Health system strengthening including achieving greater integration
of maternal and child health programmes into the national health
agenda in LMICs led to reduced under and maternal mortality
through country level including economic growth and improved infra
structure health system factors including increased investment in
midwifery training increased funding for salaries and resources
increased facility births and increased skilled birth attendance and a
high level of acceptance by providers and patients NATO policy in
strument domain organisation treasure organisation
Kayode et al in a Ghanian context found that the benefit of
increasing and strengthening cost effective and neonatal specific in
terventions such as the Safe Motherhood Program SMP and
Community Based Health Planning and Services CHPS Program on
Social Science Medicine
under mortality in line with was achieved through high levels
of acceptance of the policies and interventions among health providers
and patients which improved utilisation rates Furthermore in
Pakistan
found that integrating newborn care in
Khan et al
national health policies and programmes facilitated reduced neonatal
mortality and identified the catalysation of newborn services at both
facility and community levels through the National Maternal Newborn
and Child Health Programme as a mechanism In turn this strength
ening of the integration of neonatal care into the national health agenda
has been facilitated by civil society and academic advocacy and advisory
links with the government In a Cambodian context
Liljestrand and
found that another health system strengthening
Sambath
initiative the Safe Motherhood Programme increasing the incorpora
tion of maternal health into the national health agenda facilitated a
reduction in maternal mortality Country level factors such as peace
and stability economic growth improved transport and communication
infrastructure and improved female education as well as health system
factors such as increased facility based births increased investment in
midwifery training and increased skilled birth attendance were iden
tified as potential mechanisms
In the context of health system capacity strengthening
Fernandes
et al
found a decrease in child mortality in Mozambique and
identified a combination of financial and structural institutional mech
anisms increased health workforce density increased institutional birth
coverage and increased governmental budgetary resources to support
salaries and other health facility running costs This shows how treasury
tools can augment positive child and maternal outcomes when operating
in the context of community participation and system wide reforms
Final programme theory
Focused maternal and child health interventions led to reduced
maternal perinatal infant and under mortality in LMICs through a
demographically responsive health system and improved sickness
management NATO policy instrument domain organisation
and
Okafor et al
Bang et al
in an LMIC context
found that focused maternal and neonatal care programmes led to
reduced perinatal and maternal mortality through improved sickness
management Meanwhile
found that favourable
Acuin et al
health system development related to obstetric care and interventions
directed towards infectious diseases predicted a rapid decline in
maternal infant and under mortality in an Asian context with modest
levels of economic growth The key mechanism of this effect was iden
tified as having a demographically responsive health system Compre
hensive district level health programmes in Laos including
strengthening of district health management and improving access to
health facilities led to increased healthcare utilisation at a population
level in turn facilitating a reduction in child and infant mortality rates
in a Brazilian context
Perks et al Aquino et al
corroborated the view that reorganisation of primary health care can
reduce infant mortality also noting a reduction of health inequalities
through a greater reduction in areas with higher baseline infant mor
tality In a Tanzanian context Armstrong Schellenberg et al also
found that a strategy to integrate the management of childhood illness
reduced under mortality and identified facilitating access to health
facilities and consequent high utilisation as potential mechanisms In a
Nigerian context Findley et al identified that participatory and
community based interventions in the context of an integrated
maternal newborn and child health program increased skilled birth
attendance and follow up and infant vaccination rates as well as reduced
infant mortality rates
specifically identified a
Findley et al
benefit from increasing participation However
Narwal and Gram
in an Indian context found no evidence for the benefit of the
National Rural Health Mission on infant mortality suggesting a need for
more robust monitoring and evaluation processes
Specifically in the context of a conditional cash transfer programme
intervention incorporating a lipid based nutrient supplement
Adubra
M S Barnish et al
et al
identified weakness in intervention design and suboptimal
implementation short duration and poor coverage as reasons for
negative effects on stunting Turning in particular to the role of com
munity health workers
Meghea et al
specifically in a US
context found no overall benefit on child health of the introduction of
community health workers whereas contrastingly
Abdulahi et al
found the introduction of community health workers to be an
important component of how the health system is organised for the
benefit of child health While it is not possible to know for certain this
discrepancy in outcomes may relate to differences in health systems
context Considering another nutrition based intervention the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children
in the United States found that the
WIC
Bitler and Currie
intervention was associated with improved birth outcomes with the ef
fect being greater among more disadvantaged women
Discussion
Summary
This article presents a realist review focusing on child and maternal
health incomes in relation to policy instruments It identifies several
theories relating to public expenditure austerity conditional cash
transfer programmes health system strengthening and focused maternal
and child health interventions Treasure and organisation were the most
consistently effective single policy instruments using the NATO model
Considering multiple instruments the combination of authority treasure
and treasure organisation was shown to be particularly synergistic The
effectiveness of particular instruments was shown to be context
dependent rather than context independent It was noted that nodality
did not feature among the best supported policy instruments in this
review It is not possible to determine whether this reflects a relative
ineffectiveness of nodality for child and maternal health a preference on
the part of governments to deploy other strategies and or a preference
by researchers and funders to study other policy instrument types
Contextualisation
This work builds on a prior realist review by Barnish et al
which also considered child and maternal health outcomes in the
context of a different but related set of political exposures democracy
political tradition the welfare state and globalisation As such the
specific programme theories are different but share some thematic
commonalities The current work excluded fertility outcomes to improve
the specificity of the results This is because the directionality of the
effect of fertility data depends on the baseline population density of the
study which will differ between countries included within a single study
as well as across studies Furthermore the present review also includes
studies that presented data from only one sovereign country whereas
the prior review only considered internationally comparative studies
Thirty eight of the included studies in the current work were interna
tionally comparative The addition of studies assessing a single country
offers a valuable perspective given the selection of policy instruments
can be influenced by a range of country specific factors The policy in
strument theoretical lens helps public health scholars to examine the
broader institutional apparatuses matter in affecting governance and
capacity in implementing mega health programmes and interventions
aiming to improve maternal and child health and how these forces result
in programmes and interventions being enforced or veered away from
the intended outcomes
The present review targets the final of the five key steps identified by
Berry and Saloner for the use of policy to generate substantial
population health benefits that is to say evaluating the effects of pol
icies Work by
Gelius et al
found that the selection of harder or
softer policy instruments depends on the outcomes sought The present
work found that harder policy instruments such as treasure based
Social Science Medicine
instruments were generally preferred in the context of child and
maternal health outcomes with softer instruments in particular
nodality based instruments not featuring among the most effective
strategies Policy instruments deployed for child and maternal health
had more in common with those deployed for tobacco and alcohol policy
rather than those for encouraging good nutrition and physical activity in
the general population
Gelius et al
The realist perspective generated micro theoretical initial pro
gramme theories which were iterated through multiple rounds of dis
cussion to adjudicate the proposed theories and to situate them in the
context of macro theoretical perspectives from the wider literature For
instance the cross fertilisation of public policy theories and public
health literature means that we could apply a policy instrument theo
retical lens from public policy to dissect public health interventions for
maternal and child health to achieve a system level understanding of
their implementation mechanisms as well as dissecting the explicit and
hidden factors within the entire health system governance structure that
affect the success and failure of these programmes interventions and
reforms
The present work shows different approaches that governments and
health system organisations have deployed as they seek to address the
international health priorities World Bank United Nations General
Assembly of child and maternal health in the context of the
practice of the art and science of administering states that constitutes
politics
Analysis was undertaken using
McLean and McMillan
the NATO model for policy instruments
Results may differ
Hood
if an alternative classification scheme were to be used but there are
broad commonalities
and
Pal
for example
Vedung
speak to the degree of use of state mechanisms and authority in
deploying policy instruments
notes that the choice of in
Pal
strument may depend on the extent of state coercion that will be
accepted as legitimate for this particular purpose which speaks to
purpose specific differences in policy instrument selection as noted by
The use of a more focused instrument such as NATO
Gelius et al
affords an advantage to the present work in drawing commonalities and
distinguishing context specific differences in instrument deployment
compared to an approach such as Kirschen which offers greater
granularity However with different types of policy instruments
identified it is less amenable to comparative analysis across contexts
Greater use of treasure and authority related instruments may be
generally more aligned with social democratic and or socialist macro
theoretical perspectives Bailey Lamb and Docherty
However this will depend on specific local cultural and political con
texts as well as factors related to health system organisation Further
more an international context introduces systematic and idiosyncratic
complexities in the mapping between political characteristics and spe
cific political parties Barnish et al
Strengths and limitations
This work benefits from the use of realist methodology drawing on
the theoretical lens of critical realism to offer an explanatory perspec
tive to inform considerations around the relationships between policy
instruments and child and maternal health The use of systematic
searching of seven major scholarly databases plus relevant supplemen
tary searches and independent dual review minimised the risk of non
retrieval and reviewer bias
Most studies were ecolog
Uman
ical which permitted studies to access larger more representative
datasets across longer time spans than would be typically untenable with
individual based methods such as cohort studies and randomised
controlled trials However the risk of ecological fallacy in extrapolating
group level effects to constituent individuals should be considered Most
studies were observational which poses challenges for drawing causal
inferences although a critical realist theoretical lens can help mitigate
this Only English language articles were able to be considered

Pregnancy as a Window of Opportunity for HIV Prevention
Effects of an HIV Intervention Delivered Within Prenatal Care
Trace S Kershaw PhD Urania Magriples MD Claire Westdahl CNM MPH Sharon Schindler Rising CNM MSN and Jeannette Ickovics PhD
Young pregnant women are at high risk for
HIV and sexually transmitted infections STIs l
In a systematic review of sexual risk behavior
among pregnant or mothering adolescents
to had an STI during pregnancy and
to had an STI to months postpartum
Futhennore young pregnant women were
times less likely to use condoms compared with
nulliparous women
Despite the risks of STI and HIV infection
among women of reproductive age few HIV
interventions have specifically targeted preg
nant women The Children s Health and Re
sponsible Mothering project Project CHARM
a school based intervention of pregnant and
mothering adolescents found increases in
condom use intentions but no difference in
number of unprotected acts of sexual inter
course compared with a general health pro
motion control group Another study found
that pregnant women given a session HIV
intervention had moderate increases in knowl
edge and safer sexual behaviors that were
sustained months after the intervention
Although few studies of HIV and STI inter
ventions have targeted pregnant women some
have focused on women attending primary
care clinics Interventions for STI clinic pa
tients documented significant declines in STI
incidence However most HIV interventions
are limited because they do not integrate HIV
prevention with the provision of other ser
vices
and are not theory based
Pregnancy offers a unique opportunity for
intervention as it is a time when women engage
in high risk behaviors make behavioral
changes and have frequent contact with health
care professionals Finally
integrated with existing care systems e g pre
natal care can be sustained because care is
reimbursable by insurance
The bundling of HIV prevention with exist
ing systems can increase the accessibility of
HIV prevention by providing opportunities to
reach individuals who may not have the
Objectives We sought to determine whether an HIV prevention program
bundled with group prenatal care reduced sexually transmitted infection ST l

Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial at prenatal clinics We
assigned pregnant women aged to years N to individual care

Results Mean age of participants was years were African American
According to intent to treat analyses women assigned to the HIV prevention
group intervention were significantly less likely to have repeat pregnancy at
months postpartum than individual care and attention matched controls they
demonstrated increased condom use and decreased unprotected sexual inter
course compared with individual care and attention matched controls Sub
analyses showed that being in the HIV prevention group reduced STI incidence

Data Analytic Plan
Analyses were a series of random effects
regression analyses based on intention to treat
models with randomized condition as the pri
mary independent variable CPP CP and
Random effects allow the use of all
available data rather than excluding missing
data this allows intent to treat analyses to be
easily conducted
For each random effects
regression we treated the follow up assess
ment points as a random effect of control
ling for baseline scores We modeled a series of
planned comparisons that looked at differences
in follow up controlling for baseline scores for
CPP compared with the control groups com
bined e g CPP versus IC and CP For all
significant effects we conducted post hoc analy
ses to assess if the nature of the differences were
similar for each control group i e IC and CP
For continuous outcomes random effect regres
sions with general linear mixed models were
employed by using SAS PROC MIXED SAS
Institute Inc Cary NC For count data e g
number of unprotected sexual acts we
employed generalized linear mixed models that
used SAS PROC GLIMMIX SAS lnc
Cary NC For the count data we used a Poisson
distribution whereas for the binary data we used
a binomial distribution For the dichotomous
variable repeat pregnancy STIs we conducted
logistic regression analyses
In addition we assessed the possibility that
the intervention was more effective for key risk
subgroups Therefore we tested for possible
moderators race and age These potential
moderators were chosen because they have
been shown to be important predictors of STI
and HIV risk Interaction tests were assessed
and followed up with stratified analyses

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Despite the increased availability of family planning services FPS in low income countries their use remains
low especially in rural sub Saharan Africa To investigate to what extent this is explained by the husband s
involvement in the decision process we use an experiment in rural Tanzania in which couples choose between
two payments one being conditional on attending a family planning meeting at a health center Experimentally
varying the husband s involvement we find that FPS are more likely chosen in treatments that involve the
husband Exploring potential mechanisms we show that this is driven by couples where the wife incorrectly
believes that the husband disapproves of contraceptives We also find that involving the husband increases
the wife s expectation that the family planning meeting will be attended Both findings suggest that initiating
communication between spouses could reduce demand constraints
Family planning FP aims to help couples have their desired num
ber of children and control the spacing and timing of births This has
important benefits for couples and their children in low and middle
income countries LMICs l Large efforts have been made to provide
family planning services FPS at low costs in LMICs UNFPA
However women s unmet need for FP remains high in most countries
in sub Saharan Africa particularly in rural areas UN DESA
Izugbara et al This lack of progress suggests that important
constraints remain on the demand side Ashraf et al
Several field experiments have analyzed whether the low uptake of
FPS can be explained by the degree of the husband s involvement in the
decision process but the evidence is mixed First Ashraf et al
found that involving the husband lowers the uptake of contraceptives
at a local private health clinic This is in line with the idea that by
passing the husband could increase women s uptake of contraceptives
where men want more children and have higher bargaining power

Second other studies found a
positive effect of the husband s involvement Fisek and Sumbuloglu
Terefe and Larson wang et al McCarthy
which they attribute to better information about FP a change in men s
attitudes and better spousal communication about FP
The conflicting findings of these studies could be due to the different
stage in the decision process on which they focus Specifically Ashraf
et al
gave direct access to free contraceptives and randomized
the husband s involvement in the decision to take up the offer of
contraceptives In the other studies the husband s involvement was
randomized at an earlier stage where couples were provided with
information about FP in their homes i e before they were offered any
contraceptives In this paper we will look at an even earlier stage
whether couples choose to get in touch with the health system to receive
information about FP
This decision has not been studied yet and is important for the
following reasons First in rural areas contraceptives are mostly dis
tributed through FPS offered at health centers and therefore a decision
needs to be made to visit a health center Second even though many
people might already have been in touch with health centers and
received some information about FP e g as part of post natal care
knowledge about FP and the continuity of the use of modern contracep
tives remains low The discontinuation of contraceptives can indicate
that women are not able to make free and informed decisions when it
have inaccurate beliefs about
comes to contraceptives
the efficacy of contraceptives Miller et al or suffer side effects
This emphasizes the need for regular visits to the health center to
ensure that women find a FP method they are satisfied with
Zimmerman et al
Third visiting the nearest health center
in rural areas requires planning due to in most cases substantial
travel needs and the fact that at most health centers FP meetings
are organized at fixed times and days This adds a layer of complexity
caused by the uncertainty that the plan to visit the health center will
be carried out successfully
The involvement of the husband at this stage could influence the
outcome in several ways First spouses could have different preferences
about FPS caused by factors such as fertility preferences current con
traceptive use knowledge about FP and time preferences Second they
might have incomplete information about each other s preferences as
they tend to have little communication about FP As a result women
might be reluctant to use FPS if they believe that their husband disap
proves of them However if the husband actually supports the use of
FPS involving the husband would increase their use Lasee and Becker
Third the uncertainty that plans to visit the health center can
be carried out could create an important barrier for the uptake of FPS
This could be alleviated if the involvement of the husband reduces this
uncertainty
In this paper we investigate whether and why the husband s in
volvement influences a couple s plan to take up FPS offered at the local
health center To do so we use data from a lab in the field experiment
in rural Tanzania in which couples choose between two payments
one being conditional on attending a FP meeting at a local health
facility The experiment models the first stage of the FP decision
making process i e whether to plan to go to the local health facility
where contraceptives are delivered Couples are randomly allocated to
one of three treatments where only the wife only the husband or both
spouses together make the decisions Comparing the decisions made
across these treatments allows us to analyze the causal effect of the
husband s involvement
There are also several qualitative and observational studies that identify
the husbands lack of involvement as a main barrier for the uptake of
Lasee and Becker Sharan and Valente
contraceptives see e g
Shattuck et al Hartmann et al
Journal of Development Economics
We find that involving the husband increases the likelihood that FPS
are chosen Using a theoretical framework we explore three different
mechanisms that can explain this result First we do not find evidence
of the husband having a stronger preference for FPS than the wife
Second we find that the positive effect of the husband s involvement
is driven by women who believe that their husband does not approve
of couples using contraceptives This finding indicates that information
about spousal preferences is incomplete which makes the effect of
the husband s involvement dependent on women s beliefs about their
husband s preferences Finally we also find that the wife is less certain
about whether the plan to attend a FP meeting will be carried out
successfully when the husband is not involved in the decision This
would lower the expected value of the conditional payment when she
makes the decision alone hence making it less attractive
Using data collected after the experiment we find that most couples
who needed to attend a FP meeting to receive a payment attended
such a meeting without any difference across treatments Furthermore
once at the FP meeting a majority of couples received contraceptives
again without any difference across treatments As we will explain in
more detail both findings provide evidence against a potential social
desirability bias which might have confounded the treatment effects
Finally using the treatments as instrumental variables we find that the
condition to attend a FP meeting significantly increases contraceptive
use one month after the experiment
Our paper contributes to two strands of literature First it relates
to the literature on household bargaining over fertility and contra
ceptive use Several studies focus on bargaining over the number of
children to have Klawon and Tiefenthaler Rasul Kim and
Radoias Hener Doepke and Kindermann
Some
experimental studies look at the effect of male involvement on the
uptake of contraceptives on which they find mixed evidence Fisek and
Sumbuloglu Terefe and Larson Wang et al Ashraf
et al McCarthy
Our study differs from these studies
in at least two ways We focus on the uptake of FPS offered by the
existing public health system Moreover we are particularly interested
in whether the involvement of the husband influences couples plans to
use FPS
Second we relate to an emerging literature on incomplete infor
mation within the household While a growing number of studies
demonstrates that information asymmetries over income and choice
set matter for household decision making Castilla and Walker
Munro et al Hoel Jakiela and Ozier these papers
remain silent about the potential effect of incomplete information about
spousal preferences A few studies however do provide evidence of in
complete information about spousal preferences Bateman and Munro
Afzal et al
but remain silent about the consequences this
might have for household decision making When decisions are made
individually and without communication between spouses decisions
are based on beliefs about spousal preferences which might be inaccu
rate In this paper we demonstrate empirically and theoretically how
such beliefs can interact with the effect of the husband s involvement
in household decisions
The remainder of the article proceeds as follows Section provides
details of the experimental design Section presents the main results
and Section explores the mechanisms Section extends the analysis
by using data on contraceptive use after the experiment Section
discusses the results and concludes
Design
In this section we present the setting and the experimental de
sign including a description of the experimental tasks treatments
predictions and how the experiment was implemented
B D and C Ringdal
Setting
We conducted our study in Tanzania which has seen a steady
increase in the use of contraceptives by women aged from
in to in TNBS and Macro
The unmet
need for FP in contrast has been at around for two decades
A variety of governmental and non governmental organizations
have tried to increase the uptake of FPS in the country e g USAID sup
ported organizations
Tanzanian policy on FP and
USAID
contraceptive use aimed to increase modern contraceptive use to
by
United Republic of Tanzania In order to do so one
of the objectives was to reduce demand side constraints by increasing
men s acceptability of FP Multiple targets were used of which the most
important ones include an increase in spousal communication a change
of harmful gender norms to make FP the responsibility of both men
and women and a reduction in gender based violence which negatively
correlates with the use of contraceptives Our focus on the involvement
of men in the decision making process is very much in line with the
government s assessment and action plan
For our study we focus on the Lake zone of Tanzania which has
the highest unmet need for FP in the country In this region we
are interested in the rural population where contraceptive use tends
to be lower TNBS and Macro We selected Misungwi district
which is located kilometers south of Mwanza city and where ninety
percent live in rural settlements
Agriculture is the main
TNBS
economic activity in this district followed by livestock keeping small
scale mining and petty trade of agricultural and livestock products It
is ethnically very homogenous with most households belonging to the
Sukuma tribe which is patrilineal This makes that husbands tend to
have strong decision making power in most household decisions
Experimental task
To identify the effect of the husband s involvement on the use of
FPS we experimentally varied the involvement of the husband in the
decision making process For this we brought couples to a field lab
where they responded to financial incentives when deciding whether to
make use of FPS offered at their nearest health facility The experiment
simulates this decision by asking couples to make a series of choices
between two options A and B Option B was only paid if the wife or
the couple had attended a family planning meeting before the payment
date while option A did not have this condition The chosen option was
paid out one month after the experiment This captures an important
feature of the decision making process where a visit to the nearest
health center in rural areas requires planning In other words when
couples chose between the two options they decided whether to plan
a visit to the health center
We used a list of five pairs of choices in which we kept option
A constant and gradually increased option B The difference between
options A and B varied from TZS to TZS approx US
We used a series of five pairs instead of only one pair to increase
variation among the couples as several couples might switch their
choice from A to B within the series of pairs see Table A
We used the FP meetings that local health facilities already orga
nized every weekday The participants were informed about when these
meetings took place day and time prior to making their decisions
These meetings consist of two parts In the first part health staff
present information about health related topics including the benefits
of FP and child nutrition In the second part of the meeting the
participants can attend an individual meeting with the nurse where they
are given information about different contraceptive methods and have

constraints or lack of trust that payments would be made in the future option

Journal of Development Economics
the opportunity to receive free contraceptives These meetings are more
tailored to the individual needs than the first part which only contains
more general information The conditionality imposed in B was only
satisfied if the participants attended the individual meeting
Treatrnents
To test the effect of the husband s involvement on the uptake of FPS
offered at local health facilities we organized three between subject
treatments to which the couples were randomly allocated In these
treatments only the wife only the husband or both spouses together
made the decisions called Wife Decision WD Husband Decision
HD and Joint Decision JD respectively We brought both spouses
to the experiment to ensure that spouses had the same information
about the action set In this manner the only element that differs
across the three between subject treatments is who is involved in the
decision making
To ensure that the participants could freely choose the option
they preferred in the WD and HD treatments we provided plausible
deniability of responsibility for any outcome in these treatments In all
three between subject treatments the participants had a probability
of getting a random outcome i e where their decisions were made
irrelevant In this way it was difficult for the participant s spouse to
infer from the outcome what the participant s decisions were This
procedure was clearly explained to all participants in the first half of
the explanations where all couples were present and before they knew
which treatment they were assigned to The probability was the same
across all treatments but created plausible deniability only in WD and
HD since both spouses observed the decisions made in JD While this
procedure does not entirely remove the pressure to align preferences
with their spouse unless all participants are willing to lie to their
spouse about their decisions we expect it to reduce some of this
pressure
In addition to these between subject treatments we organized four
within subject treatments where we varied the level of payments high
or low and who needed to attend the FP meeting the wife only or
the wife and the husband together We refer to the two latter within
dimensions as Wife FPS and Couple FPS respectively In total
participants made decisions see Table A I in Appendix A The
participants were told that at the end of the experiment we would
randomly select one outcome from their decisions and the plausible
deniability option for implementation
Predictions
To develop predictions on the treatment differences in the likeli
hood that option B is chosen we use the following theoretical model
Consider a household with two decision makers s e w h where w
represents the wife and h represents the husband The household needs
Ashraf
who used a similar procedure to introduce plausible
deniability with a probability of to receive the random outcome
The within variation on who had to attend the FP meeting allows us
to analyze whether the between subject treatment effects depend on this
dimension This is important as coordination costs could be larger where both
spouses need to attend the meeting At the same time having the husband
present at the meeting might be reassuring for the wife because she knows
that her husband approves of her receiving contraceptives On the other
hand it might also give the husband control over the decision to accept
contraceptives at the health facility The variation of the payment level allows
us to test whether there are any income effects More specifically in half of
the decisions we increased the payments in options A and B by TZS
see pairs and in Table A I in Appendix A Adding variation in
payment levels allows us to disentangle an effect of increased cost income
with the Couple FPS from the mere effect of having both spouses attend the
meeting
B D and C Ringdal
to choose x e A B A is the payment they receive without needing
to attend a FP meeting and B is the payment that is conditional on
attending a FP meeting
Spouse s has complete preferences over the two options that can be
represented by a personal utility function us x We allow for the spouses
to have caring preferences and define their ultimate utility function as
Us x
where O We refer to as the caring parameter The
higher ys the more spouse s takes his or her partner s preferences
i e the partner s personal utility function into account in their
ultimate utility function is set to be equal to or lower than
as it is commonly assumed that people do not care more about their
spouse than about themselves on this see e g Browning et al
Costs associated with attending the FP meeting such as transport or
opportunity costs are implicitly taken into account in the personal
utility functions where they reduce us B As these costs are orthogonal
to treatment we do not discuss them further here
We use the collective model as developed by
Chiappori
where the household maximizes a weighted sum of the ultimate
utility functions of both spouses This model formalizes the notion of
bargaining power and shows how a change in bargaining power can
change the household decision outcome Blundell et al The
model thus allows us to predict the effect of including the husband in
the decision making process assuming that doing so would decrease
the wife s bargaining power in the household decision The household
decision can be derived as the solution to
max OUw x l
where O O I is exogenously given and reflects the wife s bargaining
power in the household decision We assume that the less we involve
the husband in the decision the more bargaining power the wife has
More specifically O I in WD O O in HD and O O I in JD Note
that when one of the spouses has all the bargaining power the decision
only depends on his or her ultimate utility function
In the following we focus on the likelihood that B is chosen over A
and how it changes with the wife s bargaining power O If the spouses
have the same preference ordering there are no treatment differences
If however the spouses have different preference orderings an in
crease in the wife s bargaining power will increase the likelihood that
her preferred option is chosen This leads to the following predictions
Prediction If the spouses have the same preferences there are no
treatment effects Thus WD JD HD
Prediction Ifthe spouses have different preferences and the wife prefers
B A and the husband prefers A B the likelihood that B is chosen
weakly decreases increases with a larger involvement of the husband
Thus WD S JD S HD
Implementation
A few weeks before the experiment we conducted a household sur
vey with a sample of couples from hamlets randomly selected
in Misungwi District in Northern Tanzania We interviewed both
In each selected hamlet we selected a random sample of couples
where the wife was below years of age and had at least one living child If
fewer than couples were available in a hamlet we selected all of them We
included both couples who were married and couples who were living together
but were not married in our sample Regardless of their marital status we
use the terms spouses husband and wife when referring to them The
experiment reported in this paper is part of a larger project on reproductive
health in Tanzania The household survey is used in other articles but the
Journal of Development Economics
spouses of each selected couple separately and in private to collect
general socio demographic characteristics and information on fertil
ity preferences contraceptive use and intra household communication
about family planning To conduct the interviews we used same gender
enumerator interviewee pairs We used these survey data to organize
the selection of the couples test whether treatments were balanced
and undertake a heterogeneity analysis of the treatment effects We
excluded all couples where the wife was pregnant when they completed
the survey or where either the husband or the wife reported to be
infecund
Each experimental session was organized in exactly the same way
Couples were convened at a central location e g a classroom or
a community center in the hamlet and the spouses were seated
apart to avoid communication with each other or any other partic
ipant We started each session with some general information about
how the experiment would be conducted no talking no phones in
formed consent anonymity etc Then the couples went through a
non incentivized task to elicit their individual time preferences There
after we provided information about the main task as well as the
content of the FP meetings Couples were then randomly allocated to
one of the three treatments WD JD or HD and called one at a time to
make the decisions in private with an enumerator Here we again used
same gender enumerator interviewee pairs In WD we had one female
enumerator in HD we used one male enumerator and in JD we used
one female and one male enumerator For the detailed experimental
instructions see Appendix D
To test the participants understanding of the instructions the enu
merator asked a set of control questions for decision pairs and
Specifically respondents were asked which option required
them to attend a FP meeting who needed to attend the meeting who
was paid and what would happen at the FP meeting If the participants
answered incorrectly an additional short explanation was given After
having gone through all control questions the enumerator recorded
whether they thought the participant had a sufficient understanding
of the task were thought to have a sufficient understanding
Each spouse received a TZS show up fee approx US
and had the opportunity to earn more during the experiment On
average each couple earned TZS approx US including the
show up fee corresponding to about one week s worth of household
income The show up fee was paid on the day of the experiment while
the remaining payment was paid one month later
After all decisions were made we privately asked participants how
likely they thought it was that they would attend a FP meeting that
their spouse would attend the meeting and that they would ask for con
traceptives at the meeting if option B was selected for payment These
questions were asked of all decision makers wife in WD husband in
HD and both in JD regardless of the decision they had made
At the end of the experiment we randomly selected one outcome
from the decisions and the plausible deniability option for pay
ment If a decision was selected in which B was chosen the wife was
given a form that had to be completed and signed by the nurse at
the closest health center the participants were informed about which
health center they should attend at the beginning of the session We
used this to verify whether the payment condition of option B was
fulfilled see Appendix D for an illustration of the form To ensure
that it was the woman or couple that participated in the experiment
that attended the FP meeting the nurse filled out the name of the
results from the experiment are only reported here As one of the purposes
of the project was to study the use of reproductive health services maternal
health care pre natal and post natal care the women interviewed needed to

When we paid the participant one month after the experimental session
we checked whether the name on the form corresponded with the name
of the participant who was given the form To do this check we used
the second part of the form that was completed and retained by the
nurse
The second part of the form also included some questions on the
uptake of contraceptives which were answered by the nurse In ad
dition when we revisited women to give their payments we asked
them some questions in private about their uptake of contraceptives In
this way we collected data on whether the FP meeting was attended
whether contraceptives were taken up at the meeting reported by
nurses at the health facilities and the participants and if so which type
of contraceptive reported by the nurse
We revisited each hamlet one month after the experimental session
to make the individual payments to the participants For this we used
the following procedure If one of the decision pairs to see Table
A was chosen i e only the wife was paid only the wife was invited
to come and receive the payment If one of the decision pairs to
was chosen i e both spouses were paid both spouses were invited
to come and receive the payment If only one of the spouses showed
up he or she would receive the payments of both spouses Payments
were always made in private With the Couple FPS however spouses
would always receive the same payment and hence could infer each
other s payment
Results
In this section we first describe the sample before presenting the
main treatment effects
The sample
In total we organized experimental sessions in hamlets
health facilities were involved in the study They were located between
min and h driving by motorbike away from the hamlets as
estimated by local hamlet leaders couples were invited to the
experiment of which couples participated show up rate
We do not find any significant differences in observable characteristics
between couples that participated and couples that did not participate
in the experiment see Table A in Appendix A
Table
presents a balance test of important characteristics of the
participants by treatment As can be seen the treatments are well
balanced in terms of observable characteristics Panel A reports socio
demographic characteristics The husbands are generally older and
have more years of education than the wives The couples have on
average three children aged or younger The proportion of Catholics
is higher among the wives while the proportion of respondents without
any religion is higher among the husbands About of women and
of men are employed outside of the household and of women
and of men are self employed Nearly of women and of
men had been growing agricultural crops in the last season The most
common crops were maize followed by sweet potatoes cassava and
rice More than of the households own cattle or pack animals or
smaller animals such as sheep goats and rabbits Most respondents
belong to the Sukuma tribe more than
With couples we interviewed both spouses while with couples
we only interviewed the wife and with couples we only interviewed the
husband The participants who did not take part in the household survey were
asked for some basic information after the experimental session including age
education and religion In total women and men were interviewed in
this way
Journal of Development Economics
Panel B reports statistics on fertility preferences About of men
and of women do not want to have any more children Among
the respondents who want to have more children most of them want to
wait at least two years before having another child Thus the need for
family planning is high On average men and women want to have
six children with a median of for women and for men
We find considerable within couple differences in fertility prefer
ences In of the couples one of the spouses does not want more
children while the other either wants more children or is undecided in
of the couples the husband does not want more children while
the wife wants more or is undecided and in of the couples the
wife does not want more children while the husband wants more or is
undecided Furthermore of the couples where both spouses want more
children disagree about when to have the next child are
couples where the husband wants to delay the next child by at least
years and the wife does not and are couples where the wife
wants to delay the next child by at least years and the husband does
not
Panel C displays current use of contraceptives see Table A in
Appendix A for past and intended use of contraceptives We present
information on the use of modern contraceptives and the use of long
acting reversible contraceptives LARC II of the wives report
using modern contraceptives and use LARC This is percent
age points higher than the percentage of couples where the husband
reported that they used modern contraceptives In other words in only
of the couples where the wife reports using modern contracep
tives the husband also reports using modern contraceptives Among
these couples of the women report that the husband does not
know that they are using contraceptives Thus intentional hiding of
contraceptive use does not seem to drive all the reporting differences
between men and women
Of the women who are not currently using contraceptives used
modern contraceptives used LARC in the past and believe
that they will use contraceptives in the future plan to use
LARC and to sterilize Interestingly while fewer men plan to use
contraceptives in the future more men than women plan to
do a sterilization For more details see Table A in Appendix
Panel D presents statistics on within couple communication about
FP and beliefs about the spouse s opinion on contraceptives In
of the couples both spouses reported that they discussed FP with each
other of the women and of the men believe that their
spouse approves of contraceptives while of the women and
of the men believe that their spouse disapproves
This is in line with the recent Demographic and Health survey
In
the Lake region both urban and rural pooled to which our study region
belongs of currently married women aged and of all
currently married men do not want any more children
We define someone to have a need for family planning if the respondent
does not want any more children or wants to wait at least two years before
having more children
The participants are asked whether they themselves or their spouse are
doing something or using any method to delay or avoid getting pregnant We
define modern contraceptives as contraceptives that give women a reliable
means to control their fertility These methods include the pill injectables
intrauterine devices IUD implants and sterilization We do not include male
condoms as women are often unable to enforce their use If we had included
condoms in modern contraceptives of women would report using modern
contraceptives LARCs include IUDs and implants We allowed couples who
already used modern contraceptives to participate in the experiment because
it might still be interesting for them to attend the FP meeting For example a
couple might want to obtain better information about contraceptives or simply
receive an updated checkup by the nurse or a woman who uses contraceptives
without her husband being aware might want to convince him that using
contraceptives is a good thing to do

Panel C in Table A in Appendix A shows that of the women
and of the men reported ever discussing FP with a nurse at a
health center Of these of the women and of the men
had the discussion in the past year and most are either completely or
somewhat satisfied with the services they received Even if a substantial
proportion of women discussed FP at the health center many of them
in the past year only of them are using modern contraceptives
and the unmet need for FP remains high One of the most commonly
cited reasons for not using contraceptives is fear of side effects
Moreover there is a lack of knowledge about FP among both men and
women As an example of women and of men do not know
whether injectables are effective in avoiding pregnancy and nearly
of both men and women believe that the pill causes infertility
for more details see Table A in Appendix A This suggests that
neither women nor men have sufficient knowledge about FP and are
in need of more information before they would start or continue using
contraceptives
Main treatment effects
To investigate the effect of the husband s involvement on the
likelihood that FPS are chosen we estimate the following regression
where yc is the proportion of the decisions where couple c chose
FPS henceforth referred to as proportion a is a constant and JD c
and HD c are treatment indicator variables taking the value if
couple c was assigned to JD and HD respectively WD is used as the
base treatment ps captures session fixed effects Xc is a set of control
variables and E c is the error term
reports the results In column we include only the
Table
treatment indicator variables In columns we sequentially add
This specification focuses on the between subject treatments For the
influence of within subject treatments see the demand curves presented in

session fixed effects socio economic controls and fertility controls
We find that involving the husband significantly increases the pro
portion of the decisions where FPS are chosen and that this effect is
robust across the different specifications The proportion is
percentage points higher in HD than in WD and is percentage
points higher in JD than in WD There is no difference in the proportion
between the two treatments where the husband is involved
To test the robustness of these results we undertake the following
additional analyses First the results are robust across the different
within subject treatments as shown in Table A in Appendix A
Second they are also robust to only including couples with a sufficient
understanding of the task and who do not switch more than once
see Table A in Appendix A It even increases the point estimates
and the statistical significance of the effects Third even though the
estimates are very similar when we add controls it should be noted that
adding controls reduces the sample by from to couples
One might therefore wonder whether removing the couples for which
we do not have background information influences the estimates To
obtain an idea of whether that might be the case we remove the
controls from the regression in column in Table The results are
presented in column of Table A in Appendix A and are again
very similar Fourth of the couples in our sample are polygamous
Distance to the nearest health center might matter as they determine
travel costs The session fixed effects we include in the regressions control
for distance to the health center because all participants in a session were
recruited from the same hamlet
A comparison of the within subject treatments see Table A in Appendix
A shows that i in the high payment condition the effect of the husband s
involvement is stronger when both spouses need to attend the FP meeting
and ii in the condition where only the wife needs to attend the FP meeting
Wife FPS the effect of the husband s involvement is weaker in the high
payment condition
of the couples switched more than once in a price list and
of the couples had a sufficient understanding As can be seen in Table A in
Appendix A there are no differences in understanding and multiple switching
across treatments
Journal of Development Economics
evenly distributed across treatments p from F test see Table
A in Appendix A As polygamous and monogamous couples might
behave differently it is important to test whether the results are influ
enced by the inclusion of polygamous couples Column in Table A
in Appendix A shows the regression results with monogamous couples
only The results are again robust Finally we add experimenter fixed
effects in Table A in Appendix A As different enumerators were used
in the WD and HD treatments only female enumerators were involved
in WD and only male enumerators were involved in HD we cannot
control for experimenter effects for the comparison between WD and
HD However as all enumerators were involved in JD we can control
for experimenter effects for the pairwise comparisons between JD and
each of the other treatments As can be seen from Table A in Appendix
A the results remain robust
Mechanisms
So far we found that involving the husband increases the likelihood
that FPS are chosen This result indicates that Uh A
Uw A In this section we explore potential mechanisms
that might explain why women and men evaluate options A and
B differently More specifically the positive effect of involving the
husband can be driven by one of the following mechanisms
The husband gets more personal utility from FPS than his wife
The wife incorrectly believes that her husband disapproves of
contraceptives
The wife expects that the plan to use FPS is less likely to be
fulfilled when the husband is not involved
In the rest of this section we will look for supporting evidence on
each of the three mechanisms We will also develop our theoretical
model to incorporate the role of beliefs about spousal preferences
second mechanism and uncertainty about whether the FP meeting
will be attended third mechanism
Does the husband have a stronger preference for FPS
Involving the husband in the decision could increase the likelihood
that FPS are chosen if the husband gets more personal utility from FPS
than his wife Recall that the ultimate utility function is defined as
Us l Thus involving the husband increases the
likelihood that B is chosen if uh B uw B
To find evidence for this mechanism we look into three possible
sources of spousal differences in FPS preferences i fertility prefer
ences awareness of contraceptive use and unmet need for FP ii
knowledge about FP and iii hyperbolic time preferences We explore
each of them in turn
Fertility preferences awareness of contraceptive use and unmet FP
need
It is plausible that if an individual has a need for family planning
i e does not want more children or wants to delay having more
children this individual is more likely to prefer FPS In our sample
we observe important differences in fertility preferences between men
and women As reported in
more women than men do not want
Table
more children There are also important within couple differences In
of the couples in our sample one of the spouses in this is
the husband does not want more children while the other does or is
undecided In couples where both spouses want more children there
is also important heterogeneity in how long they want to wait with
getting the next child
Some of the analyses in this section were not pre specified in our pre
analysis plan The idea of inaccurate beliefs is discussed in Appendix A I of
the pre analysis plan

Within couple differences in fertility preferences might translate
into within couple differences in preferences for FPS For example the
husband might have a stronger preference for FPS than his wife if he
has weaker fertility preferences than his wife e g when the husband
does not want another child while the wife does If the positive effect of
the involvement of the husband is driven by the husband s preference
for FPS we should find that this effect is stronger among couples where
the husband has a weaker fertility preference than his wife than
among couples where the spouses have the same fertility preferences
or the wife has weaker fertility preferences than her husband
To test this we interact the treatment variables with spousal pref
erence differences The results are reported in column in
Table
In this column Var takes the value one if the husband has a need for
family planning while the wife does not of the couples Var
is zero whenever the husband and the wife have the same preferences
or the wife has weaker fertility preferences than the husband First we
note that if the husband does not have weaker fertility preferences than
his wife involving the husband still increases the likelihood that FPS
are chosen as can be seen by the positive and significant coefficients
on JD and HD If the husband has weaker fertility preferences the
treatment differences become larger but not significantly so Thus
differences in fertility preferences do not appear to be driving the
treatment differences
The link between the husband s fertility preferences and his pref
erence for FPS could depend on whether he is aware that his wife
already uses modern contraceptives
Table
shows that husbands
compared to their wife are less likely to report that they use modern
contraceptives This implies that even where spouses have the same fer
tility preferences the husband may have a stronger preference for FPS
than the wife if he does not know that they are using contraceptives
To test whether this could explain the positive effect of the husband s
involvement in the decision we interact the treatment variables with
the husband s unawareness of contraceptive use in column in
Table
The husband s unawareness of contraceptive use is defined
as an indicator variable taking the value one if the wife reports using
Journal of Development Economics
modern contraceptives while the husband does not zero otherwise
This is the case in of the couples If the husband s unawareness of
contraceptive use is driving our results we would expect the interaction
Table
to be positive and significant As can be seen the
terms in
interaction term with JD is negative and the interaction term with
HD is far from significant suggesting that the husband s awareness of
contraceptive use is not driving the results
A third factor that might influence the treatment effects is the
husband s unmet need for FP which combines his fertility preferences
and awareness of contraceptive use In particular if the husband has an
unmet need for FP while the wife does not either because of differences
in fertility preferences or different reporting of contraceptive use
involving the husband might increase the uptake of FPS In
Table
unmet need for FP is an indicator variable taking the value one if
the husband has an unmet need for FP while the wife does not of
couples zero otherwise We again expect the interaction terms to be
positive and significant if these couples are driving the results As can
be seen this is not the case suggesting that this factor does not drive
the positive effect of the husband s involvement
Knowledge about FP
Men might have lower knowledge about the benefits and costs of
FP than their wives This is in line with e g Ashraf et al
who
showed that men have lower knowledge about reproductive health risks
mostly related to labor and delivery outcomes than women If men
have a need for knowledge their lower knowledge might translate into
a stronger preference for FPS where knowledge can be obtained
To test whether this mechanism explains the positive effect of the
husband s involvement we use data from the survey in which we
asked the respondents a set of knowledge questions about FP These
questions range from the efficacy of contraceptives to pregnancy risks
see Table A in Appendix A For each statement a relatively large
fraction of both women and men answer that they do not know whether
the statement is true or not of women and of men answer
do not know on at least one of the five statements Women are
significantly less likely to give this answer than men times vs
times p from a two sided t test
To investigate whether the lack of knowledge about FP influences
the treatment effects we interact the treatments with the difference in
knowledge between the husband and the wife If lack of knowledge is
driving the treatment effects we expect small or no treatment differ
ences when the husband has an equal or larger amount of knowledge
about FP than the wife Further we expect the interaction terms to be
positive and significant which would indicate that husbands with less
knowledge about FP are driving the results
Table
displays the results
In column we interact the treatment variables with an indicator
variable taking the value one if the husband answers do not know
more frequently than the wife of couples In column we use
the difference in do not know answers between the husband and the
wife when the husband answers do not know more frequently than
the wife it is zero otherwise The average difference is questions
with a standard deviation of As can be seen neither of the
interaction terms are significant suggesting that a lack of knowledge
is not driving the results
Hyperbolic time preferences
As option B is conditional on attending a FP meeting at the local
health center it can be used as a commitment device This implies that
the husband might have a stronger preference for FPS if he benefits
more from its use as a commitment device than his wife To test this we
look at the participants time preferences It has been demonstrated that
people might have a preference for commitment if they have hyperbolic
time preferences i e they are more patient in the future than in the
present see e g Ashraf et al
We elicit time preferences by asking the participants to choose
between a hypothetical smaller reward the day after the experiment

or a larger reward after one month referred to as near time frame
The same question was also asked for a later time frame six versus
seven months to identify potential reversals in time preferences see
Section D of the Appendix for more details We define an individual
to have hyperbolic time preferences if the estimated discount rate is
higher in the near time frame than the later time frame
We do not find any gender differences in discount rates On average
husbands and wives have a discount rate of and respec
tively in the nearer time frame p value from two sided t test
In the later time frame women are slightly more patient than men with
a monthly discount rate of and respectively p value from
two sided t test More women than men display hyperbolic time
preferences vs respectively two sided t test p
If participants used option B as a commitment device we should
find that the proportion of decisions where FPS is chosen is higher
among the participants with hyperbolic time preferences We test this in
columns in
Table
As can be seen the coefficients are negative
and not significant indicating that the choice of FPS is not used as
a commitment device in the individual treatments Therefore we do
not expect that a difference in hyperbolic time preferences between
the husband and the wife influences the treatment differences This
is indeed what we find in column Given that we are looking
for a mechanism behind the positive effect of husband s involvement
on the choice of FPS we focus on the case where the husband has
hyperbolic time preferences and the wife has not As can be seen by the
insignificant interaction terms this is not driving the treatment effects
Inaccurate beliefs
The second explanation for the positive effect of the husband s
involvement assumes that women have inaccurate beliefs about their
husband s preferences for FP In patriarchal societies in low income
countries FP is often a contentious topic which might generate spousal
disagreement or even conflict This makes it difficult for women to
initiate a conversation about this topic Mosha et al Amo
Adjei et al
As a result there tends to be little discussion or
communication among spouses about FP In Panel D of Table we

see that only of the couples reported that they discussed FP with
their partner in the past year This could make beliefs about spousal
preferences inaccurate
To see how the treatment predictions change when the wife has
inaccurate beliefs about her husband s preferences we rewrite the
wife s ultimate utility function in Eq
Uw x
x
where E is the expectation operator over a set U of utility functions for
h We assume that incomplete information is only a problem when the
decision is made individually by the wife as there is no communication
between the spouses In JD in contrast both spouses will get to know
each other s preferences as they make the decision together
When discussing beliefs we refer to beliefs about the personal
preference ordering of the spouse If the wife has inaccurate beliefs
it means that she believes that the husband gets more personal utility
from A than B while the opposite is true As long as Eueuuh B uh B
having inaccurate beliefs lowers the likelihood that the wife chooses
B Thus if there is no conflict in the household inaccurate beliefs
might lead to Pareto dominated choices when the decision is made
individually For example if us B us A for both spouses but the
wife has inaccurate beliefs the likelihood that B is chosen is lower
when the decision is made by the wife than when it is made jointly
or by the husband assuming that he has accurate beliefs In this case
if inaccurate beliefs lead the wife to choose A instead of B both spouses
would have been better off if the decision had been B
Thus the theory shows that if the wife incorrectly expects her
husband to prefer A involving the husband increases the likelihood

that FPS are chosen We will look for evidence that supports this
prediction In the survey conducted before the experiment we asked
the participants whether they believed that their spouse agreed with
the use of contraceptives Even though this is not a measure of the
wife s beliefs about their husband s preferences over options A and B
there is a clear link between attending a FP meeting and the use of
contraceptives the couples need to attend such a meeting to receive
free contraceptives Therefore we use this measure as a proxy for the
wives beliefs about their husband s preferences over the two options
Overall as shown in
of the women in our sample believe
Table
that their husband approves of contraceptives and believe that
their husband disapproves The remaining category includes women
who either do not know or believe that the spouse is indifferent
If women s beliefs are behind the positive effect of the husband s
involvement we should find that this effect is strongest among couples
where the wife believes that her husband disapproves of contraceptives
To test this we interact the treatment variables with women s beliefs
Table

Wife FPS i e where only the wife had to attend a FP meeting in
column and the proportion for Couple FPS i e where both the
wife and the husband had to attend a FP meeting in column We
report the results for each condition separately to verify whether the
effects differ between both conditions
Two findings are worth noting First the coefficients of JD and
HD are positive and statistically significant in all columns This
The question asked whether they thought that their spouse agreed with
couples in general using contraceptives In this way we avoided that they had
to think about their own relationship which might bias reporting Moreover
we did not ask directly about their beliefs about their spouse s preference
over options A and B because this could either bias their decisions in the
experiment if we elicited these beliefs before the decisions were made or the
beliefs themselves could be biased if we elicited them after the decisions were
made
Journal of Development Economics
indicates that among couples where the wife does not believe that her
husband approves of contraceptives involving the husband increases
the proportion of decisions where FPS are chosen In JD the proportion
is between and percentage points higher than in WD and
in HD the proportion is percentage points higher Second the
coefficients of the interaction terms JD X Beliefs and HD X Beliefs
are negative and statistically significant This indicates that the differ
ences between the WD treatment and each of the other treatments are
significantly smaller when the wife believes that her husband approves
of contraceptives
These results suggest that women incorrectly believe that their
husband disapproves of contraceptives which makes women less likely
to choose FPS if their husband is not involved in the decision Note
that we do not have data on the true preferences of each spouse and
can therefore not directly test whether beliefs are accurate However
we do have data on the desired number of children of each spouse
as well as their beliefs about the desired number of children of their
spouse We expect that the desired number of children correlates closely
with preferences about options A and B We find that in of the
couples the wife reports not knowing how many children her husband
wants and out of the couples where the wife does report how many
children she thinks her husband wants she overestimates the number
in of the couples Moreover among the couples where the wife
makes an estimate on how many children her husband wants there is
a negative correlation between the number of children she believes her
spouse wants and whether she believes her spouse approves of contra
ceptives spearman s p p Both observations taken
together suggest that women s beliefs about their spouse s approval of
contraceptives are downward biased as we assumed when interpreting
the regression results above
In sum these observations together with the significant interaction
terms in the regressions support that the positive effect of the hus
band s involvement is driven by women s inaccurate beliefs about their
husband s preferences
The wife s expected utility of B
Our model so far ignored any possible actions taken after the
experiment However it might be that our participants anticipated
any post experimental actions when making their decisions in the lab
The third and last mechanism that we explore assumes that the wife s
expected utility of option B Euw B might be lower in WD than in
the other treatments because she anticipates post experimental actions
Note that this is different from the previous mechanism where we as
sumed there was certainty about the utility of option B and uncertainty
about the husband s preferences
In
Table
the Wife s beliefs indicator variable takes the value O either
if the wife believes that the husband disapproves of contraceptives or if she
does not know As a robustness test we do the same analysis only with couples
where the wife either believes that the husband approves or disapproves As
can be seen in Table A in Appendix A the results are robust
The main reason why we did not use beliefs about the desired number of
children in the regression is that in of the couples the wife reported not
knowing the husband s preferences making it difficult to compare with the
husband s reported number of children
This bears some resemblance to a potential undoing problem which
complicates intra household experiments
In many couple
Munro
experiments there is a risk that decisions can be undone after the experiment
For example a husband who disagrees with the decisions made by their wife
can reallocate economic resources received in an experiment That husbands
can claim transfers from their wife is supported by Anderson and Baland
who document how women use local saving groups to protect savings
from their husband s claims It is important to clarify that while the decisions
made in our lab experiment cannot be undone some actions taken after the
experiment can change the utility of options A and B
B D and C Ringdal
Specifically if option B is chosen it is possible that the husband
does not allow their wife to attend the FP meeting or does not join their
wife when this is a condition i e with the couple FPS In that case they
do not receive any payment and option B becomes less attractive The
perceived likelihood that the conditionality is fulfilled is reduced in the
WD treatment as women are often unable to make decisions on their
own about their mobility or have limited access to resources Note that
these are typical measures of women s empowerment and bargaining
Malapit et al Bandiera et al For example in
power
our sample only of the women can decide alone whether to visit
their family or friends If women have limited mobility and access to
resources their expected utility of B might be lower in WD since they
would have to negotiate with their husband to use household resources
or leave the house to visit the local health center
In our model this would be captured as follows Assume that the
wife assigns probability O p I that she attends the FP meeting
and probability l p that she does not Then the expected utility
from choosing option B assuming that she obtains no utility if the
conditionality is not fulfilled is
Euw B puw B puw B
This implies that a lower expectation that the conditionality is
fulfilled leads to a lower likelihood that option B is chosen When the
decision is made jointly in JD we assume that the likelihood that the
conditionality is fulfilled if B is chosen is higher than in WD This is
the case as the husband would not choose option B if he was unwilling
to approve women s mobility or the use of household resources needed
to visit the health center and thus fulfill the conditionality
To obtain an idea of the expectation that the conditionality is
fulfilled we asked the participants how likely it was that they would
attend a FP meeting if option B was selected for payment At that point
participants had made all decisions but the selection of the decision
was not made yet hence the participants did not know yet whether
they would need to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment All
participants who made a decision i e women only in WD men only in
HD and both spouses in JD answered this question even the ones who
never chose option B Note that the plausible deniability mechanism we
used made these participants face a non zero chance that they would
need to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment
To elicit the individual expectation that the conditionality would be
fulfilled we asked whether it was very unlikely unlikely neither
unlikely nor likely likely or very likely that i the wife and ii
the husband would attend the FP meeting if option B was chosen for
payment In the following we have converted these alternatives into
a scale from to where indicates very unlikely and very
likely The elicited beliefs are highly correlated with the choice of FPS
Spearman s p p for both types of conditionalities
In general the expectation that the conditionality will be fulfilled is
high with most respondents finding it likely or very likely that they will
attend the FP meeting if option B was chosen for payment
Table
tests
whether the expectations differ between WD and JD and between HD
and JD for women s and men s beliefs respectively First we observe
that the husband s beliefs do not vary between treatments For the
wife s beliefs there is no difference in expectations when only she needs
to attend the FP meeting Wife FPS If both the wife and the husband
need to attend the FP meeting Couple FPS we find that the wife s
expectations about the husband s attendance are significantly higher in
Women s empowerment and bargaining power can be measured in several
ways The DHS typically focuses on household decision making including
whether the woman can decide whether to visit family and friends The

of women s empowerment that includes the productive sphere in agricultural
settings Access to resources is part of this index For a review of measures of

JD than in WD p This indicates that the uncertainty about
fulfilling the conditionality of the Couple FPS is larger in WD than in
JD This might reduce the likelihood that the wife chooses FPS in WD
compared to JD and HD However as there are no differences between
treatments in expectations for Wife FPS it is unlikely that uncertainty
about the attendance of the FP meeting can explain the full treatment
effects
The expected utility of option B may also be lower for women who
suffer from intimate partner violence IPV especially if they believe
that there is a chance that the husband may become violent if she
committed herself to visit the health center by choosing option B
without consulting him Table A in Appendix A shows that being
subjected to IPV does not affect the treatment differences
Attendance of FP meeting and contraceptive use
In this section we extend the analysis by looking at behavior after
the decisions are made in the lab Specifically we test i whether the
FP meeting is attended and whether contraceptives are chosen at the FP
meeting if option B is chosen for payment and ii whether the uptake
of contraceptives is higher if option B is chosen For these analyses we
use data collected by the nurse at the health center and data reported
by the participants when they received the payments
The FP meeting
In this section we look at the treatment effects on i the atten
dance of the FP meeting conditional on option B being chosen for
payment and on ii contraceptive use conditional on attending the
FP meeting This analysis tells us whether the husband s involvement
matters for the fulfillment of the condition of option B and whether the
husband s involvement or presence at the FP meeting affects the uptake
of contraceptives

The first two rows of

compare these proportions by treatment
In these two rows the sample sizes are the number of couples in
each treatment where option B was chosen for payment Involving
the husband in the lab increases the likelihood that a FP meeting is
attended especially in JD for both Wife FPS and Couple FPS This
result is in line with the wife s expectations about the attendance of the
FP meeting see Section it is more likely that the FP meeting is
attended if the decision in the lab is made jointly than if the decision
is made by the wife alone
Next we investigate what happens once the wife or the couple are at
the FP meeting of the wives that attended a FP meeting received
modern contraceptives The presence of the husband at the FP meeting
does not affect the uptake of contraceptives no difference between
Couple FPS and Wife FPS two sided t test p As can be
seen from the third and fourth rows of
Table
the use of contraceptives
does also not vary across the between subject treatments The husband
does not seem to have an influence on the use of contraceptives once
they attend the FP meeting
Different types of contraceptives can be received at the FP meeting
To ensure continuity the use of a LARC implants or IUDS is important
of the women attending a FP meeting received a LARC As can be
seen from the two last rows in
Table
the uptake of LARC does not
depend on whether the husband is involved in the decision in the lab
but it does depend on whether the husband attended the FP meeting
with Wife FPS and with Couple FPS two sample
two sided t test p
In sum once option B is chosen for payment most couples attend a
FP meeting Once at the meeting most couples receive contraceptives
and a non negligible fraction of them receive LARC These findings can
also be interpreted as evidence against a potential social desirability
bias that might confound the treatment effects It is plausible that the
participants wanted to appear more in favor of using FPS than they
actually are in order to please our research team if they assumed
that we care about contraceptive use remember that their decisions
were recorded by one of the enumerators Such bias might increase the
overall proportion of decisions where FPS are chosen and confound the
treatment differences if this bias is stronger among the husbands than
among the wives in our sample
The husbands who choose FPS only to please us would then try to
make sure that their choice does not translate into reduced fertility
They could do so by i not attending a FP meeting ii not accepting
any contraceptives at the meeting or iii only accepting short term
contraceptives at the meeting As we have seen the involvement of the
husband does not reduce the likelihood of a FP meeting being attended
or the uptake of contraceptives We take this as evidence against a
social desirability bias that might affect our results
For women it is difficult to disentangle social desirability bias from the
effect of low mobility and control over resources However we can compare
The effect of the choice of FPS on contraceptive use
We observed that a large proportion of the couples for which option
B was chosen for payment attended a FP meeting and once at the
FP meeting a large proportion chose contraceptives It is interesting
to test whether having to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment
translates into an increase in contraceptive use Note that the couples
for which option A was chosen could still have taken up contraceptives
outside the experiment To test this we need to deal with potential
endogeneity that might bias the estimate of the effect of FPS services
To do so we exploit the random assignment to treatments and the
finding that the involvement of the husband increased the uptake of
FPS This allows us to use the treatment assignment as an instrumental
variable for the choice of FPS
To test whether the uptake of contraceptives is influenced by the
selection of FPS we regress contraceptive use as reported on the
payment date on the selection of FPS
Table
displays the results In columns the selection of
FPS is treated as exogenous To deal with potential endogeneity in
columns we instrument the selection of FPS by the experimental
treatments As shown by the first stage the choice of FPS is higher when
the husband is involved i e in both JD and HD with the exception of
JD when the condition is Wife FPS see column
Table
shows that the choice of FPS increases contraceptive use
significantly When treating FPS as exogenous the likelihood that
contraceptives are chosen increases by around percentage points if
option B is chosen for payment The size of this effect is around per
centage points smaller when taking into account potential endogeneity
bias
the reports of women and nurses on the uptake of contraceptives at the FP
meeting If women report a higher uptake of contraceptives than nurses this
can be an indication of a social desirability bias Among the couples who
attended the family planning meeting of the women reported that they
received contraceptives which is very close to the as reported by the
nurses Spearman s p p
A few participants were not interviewed when we visited them to give
their payment This was the case where the option chosen gave a zero payment
to both the wife and the husband of the couples Despite this one
of these women still attended the payment session even though no payment
was given The rest are excluded from the analysis In addition of the
remaining couples did not show up to receive payment Of these women
had attended the FP meeting and we therefore use the report from the nurse
The remaining couples are excluded from the analysis implying that about
are excluded from this analysis
Note that the use of the plausible deniability mechanism might have
decoupled for some participants the link between the treatments and the final
selection of the payment which might have weakened the treatment effects
in the first stage

Discussion and conclusion
In this paper we report the results of an experiment in which
couples can choose a payment conditional on receiving FPS at a local
health facility We find that involving the husband increases the likeli
hood that couples choose FPS Most couples that need to attend FPS to
receive a payment visit the health center and once there most of them
choose to continue or start to use contraceptives In sum our study
demonstrates that the husband has a very strong influence in the first
stage of the decision making process which is essential for the uptake
of FPS and modern contraceptives
Using a household model that assumes complete information about
spousal preferences and complete certainty about the fulfillment of the
conditionality our finding that the husband s involvement increases
the likelihood that FPS are chosen can only be explained if men have
stronger preferences for FPS than women We do not find evidence for
this assumption In a next step we extend our theoretical model and
test two alternative mechanisms that could explain the positive effect of
the husband s involvement First we show theoretically that inaccurate
beliefs about spousal preferences can explain the observed treatment
effects We find strong evidence in support of this mechanism the
positive effect of involving the husband is driven by couples where
the wife believes that the husband does not approve of contraceptives
Second we consider the role of the wife s expectations concerning the
likelihood that a FP meeting is attended We find some support for this
mechanism the expectation that the Couple FPS payment condition
is fulfilled is larger when the husband is involved in the decisions in
the lab
Our results are in line with several qualitative and observational
studies that describe how the non involvement of husbands and the
lack of communication between spouses can create substantial bar
riers for the uptake of contraceptives see e g
Lasee and Becker
Sharan and Valente Shattuck et al Hartmann
et al Mosha et al and
Amo Adjei et al Lasee
and Becker
show using DHS data from Kenya that the wife s
beliefs about whether the husband approves of family planning and
communication between spouses are highly correlated with contracep
tive use and that the wife s beliefs about the husband s preferences
Journal of Development Economics
are more likely to be correct if the couple discusses family planning
Our analysis confirms that initiating communication among spouses is
a sufficient condition to increase the likelihood that FPS are chosen
JD forces the couples to communicate In sum our study has not
only provided experimental evidence that supports the policy advice
from these studies to stimulate communication among spouses It has
also generated new insights into why and when it could increase the
uptake of contraceptives In particular we demonstrated that the effect
of a lack of communication or the non involvement of the husband
risks creating inaccurate beliefs about spousal preferences which could
make women reluctant to use FPS It is also clear from our analysis that
a policy that stimulates communication among spouses would only be
effective where spouses do not have substantially different preferences
about FPS
Our study also complements the insights generated by other ex
perimental studies on the husband s involvement Ashraf et al
demonstrated that bypassing the husband could increase women s up
take of contraceptives where men want more children and have higher
bargaining power than women However this might lower women s
subjective well being due to increased spousal dissatisfaction In a
more recent study
Ashraf et al showed that increasing the
husband s knowledge about maternal health costs reduces pregnancy
rates without affecting spousal satisfaction Treating husbands not only
lowers their desired fertility it also leads to more frequent communica
tion about family planning and higher marital satisfaction They also
find that husbands have more accurate beliefs about their wife s fertility
preferences
McCarthy found that the husband s involvement
reduces pregnancy rates but not where there is recent IPV We do
not investigate the effect of the husband s involvement on knowledge
or spousal satisfaction Further in contrast with McCarthy we
do not find that the husband s involvement interacts with IPV Our
results demonstrate that the husband s involvement has the potential
to increase the uptake of contraceptives by correcting women s beliefs
about their husband s fertility preferences
More broadly our findings indicate that where information about
spousal preferences is incomplete existing household models should
incorporate individual beliefs about spousal preferences as an addi
tional parameter This increases the complexity of household models
and broadens the set of potential effects of the involvement of the
husband It also opens the door to potential efficiency losses when
decisions are made individually In our setting characterized by large
gender inequality and inaccurate beliefs about spousal preferences this
translates in a positive effect of the husband s involvement on the
uptake of the opportunities offered Our results suggest that reaching
out to women might be less effective if the husband is not involved
In particular there is a considerable risk that opportunities offered to
women remain then underutilized
The results presented in this paper point to several avenues for fu
ture research First we need more theoretical and empirical research on
the role of incomplete information in household bargaining to achieve
a better understanding of household decision making Why is there
incomplete information in the household and how can this be modeled
theoretically In what domains do we observe incomplete informa
tion between spouses Second further research on intra household
communication about fertility preferences is necessary to increase our
understanding of intra household decision making and its effect on
contraceptive use For example more evidence is needed on the con
ditions under which such communication takes place and could be
facilitated Finally it is likely that communication influences efficiency
in household decision making in other domains as well where spouses
potentially think they disagree While we focused on contraceptives
on which we know there tends to be little discussion among spouses in
patriarchal societies in low income countries similar questions can be
asked about other domains where there is little communication among
spouses

Abstract
Background
Computerized decision support systems CDSS and performance based incentives PBls can improve
health worker performance However there is minimal evidence on the combined effects of these interventions or
perceived effects among maternal and child healthcare providers in low resource settings We thus aimed to explore
the perceptions of maternal and child healthcare providers of CDSS support in the context of a combined CDSS PBI
intervention on performance in twelve primary care facilities in Ghana s Upper East Region
Methods We conducted a qualitative study drawing on semi structured key informant interviews with nurses
and midwives health facility managers and district level staff familiar with the intervention We analysed data
thematically using deductive and inductive coding in NVivo software
Results Interviewees suggested the combined CDSS PBI intervention improved their performance through enhanc
ing knowledge of maternal health issues facilitating diagnoses and prescribing prompting actions for complications
and improving management Some interviewees reported improved morbidity and mortality However challenges
described in patient care included CDSS software inflexibility e g requiring administration of only one intermittent
preventive malaria treatment to pregnant women faulty electronic partograph leading to unnecessary referrals
increased workload for nurses and midwives who still had to complete facility forms and power fluctuations affecting

Conclusion
Combining CDSS and PBI interventions has potential to improve maternal and child healthcare provi
Sion in low income settings However user perspectives and context must be considered along with allowance for
revisions when designing and implementing CDSS and PBls interventions
Keywords
Computerised decision support system Performance based incentives mHealth Maternal and neonatal
health Ghana
Background
Frontline health worker performance is a common chal
lenge in resource constrained settings Health worker
behaviours are complex with many potential influences
though research indicates general enablers of improved
performance include in service training in use of tools
constructive feedback and receiving positive recognition
In low and middle income country LMIC health
systems performance is additionally constrained by staff
ing deficiencies and ad hoc task shifting thus weakening
capacity to achieve national and global health goals
Access to health infrastructure is indispensable but not
enough and poor quality of care impedes achieving
Sustainable Development Goal ensure healthy lives
and promote well being for all at all ages Therefore
health systems must ensure good quality care
A key example of this issue is maternal and neonatal
health MNH which cannot improve in LMICs without
ensuring the availability of adequate numbers of compe
tent and motivated providers at health facilities Despite
improvements in access to and use of MNH care in many
LMICs mortality rates remain high and gaps between
low income and high income countries continue The
high levels of mortality are attributed to poor quality of
care in the health facilities characterized by over
crowding and understaffing with inappropriate manage
ment of complicated deliveries and untimely response to
emergencies
Initial efforts focused on improving MNH provider
performance through in service trainings assuming
problems are due to inadequate knowledge and skills
Millions of training dollars later healthcare indica
tors are little improved and MNH providers still require
support Recognising training is not the only solu
tion more recent interventions involve infrastructure
improvements and advocacy for skilled birth attendance
Packages of interventions appear more effec
tive than single interventions For example assess
ment of Standards Based Management and Recognition
SBM RO for quality improvement in three Ethiopian
hospitals and eight health centres showed significant
improvement in MNH provider performance during
labour delivery and immediate postnatal services
Evidence suggests computerised decision support sys
tems CDSS and performance based incentives PBIs
could enhance health worker motivation and perfor
mance CDSS are electronic tools that prompt
provider behaviours with patient specific prompts
treatment guidelines automatic medication dosing cal
culations and reports of overdue tests and medications
PBIs involve compensating health workers for work
beyond their typical remit so they feel appreciated and
that effort is valued Offering monetary or other recog
nition for high performing employees aims to counter
act weak or indirect health system incentives
by directly linking rewards to actions that achieve per
formance targets and therefore contribute to improved
health outcomes P Bls can also enhance effec
tiveness by stimulating innovation enhancing teamwork
incentivizing service in remote locations and improving
retention
Literature focuses on individual effect of P Bls on
health worker motivation but not on the combined
effects of CDSS and P Bls on performance Our
previous study in Ghana s Upper East Region was one of
the first to analyse the combined effects of these inter
ventions on client satisfaction with maternal and neo
natal healthcare Implementation of CDSS in the
context of an ongoing PBI intervention in Upper East
Region provided an opportunity to examine perceived
effects of both interventions among health workers as
we found no other qualitative studies on this topic and
research had shown sub optimal motivation and perfor
mance among maternal and neonatal healthcare provid
ers in these areas and potential scope for improvement
This qualitative study thus aimed to explore
health worker perspectives of the effects of CDSS in the
context of a combined CDSS PBI intervention on mater
nal and child healthcare provision in primary facilities in
Ghana s Upper East Region

are entering it will ask you whether you have given
the drug It has affected IPT intermittent pre
ventive treatment for malaria because the way the
book is sometimes you can forget that the person
has not taken IPT but the computer will alert you
Midwife years intervention arm
I will say the quality of maternal care has
improved We are now prompted to administer cer
tain drugs like Albendazole Midwife years
intervention arm
Similarly many frontline providers noted how useful it
was having key messages and educational information at
their fingertips
I t will be alerting you on what to do So I will say
it guides us on what to do and how to do but before
you have to make your own decision Midwife
years intervention arm
Improved performance
Several frontline health workers described being
more efficient or better performing their duties Some
described this in relation to CDSS
It CDSS has affected antenatal coverage because
you are able to attend to more clients in a day
Sometimes we attend to about women in a day
Midwife years intervention arm
Performance has improved in the sense that if you
open the and the registers you will see
a vast difference Now we check all the HB haemo
globin of the clients and we also counsel them a lot
Also if the woman comes and she is weeks the
computer will tell you what to do since it is pre term
labou Medical Assistant years intervention
arm
Many described improvements in relation to P Bls and
increased motivation
I work hard since I know it will pay off by not only
improving quality of care but something small from
the project Midwife intervention facility
Some midwives also related P Bls to improving their job
satisfaction as well as performance
I like the performance based package because when
I perform well I am awarded I get inner satisfac
tion Ihat helps me to give my best Midwife inter
ventionfacility
Managers with access to aggregated data described
similar perspectives
Ihe interventions CDSS PBI have contributed
to improved performance because the midwife is
more committed to work She barely even leaves the
maternity and I think it has even increased some of
Aninanya et al BMC Health Services Research
the indicators and deliveries over the past few years
Our facility has contributed significantly to the dis
trict performance which has been recognized by the
district lhere has been an improvement in anti tet
anus vaccinations to pregnant women and intermit
tent preventive treatment I realized that previously
there were issues child welfare and Penta
but I think over the past years there has been an
improvement Medical Assistant years male
intervention arm
Several managers also noted benefits of PBIs particu
larly in terms of midwives motivation to work more
actively
Performance based incentives have made them
happy It shows that they are working You know
they had certificates they had parcels This has
made them very happy and they are doing the work
It has made them to do the work more and more
Facility manager intervention facility
Improved clinical processes and outcomes
Most described improved work processes with some
describing this as improving quality of care while others
referred to improving MNH outcomes including mortal
ity For example a district manager referred to CDSS as
their new doctor
Ihe computer also has all the protocols so because
this district we don t have a doctor the computer is
now our doctor Ihe computer guides us The nurse
doesn t panic because the computer tells them what
to do District Public Health Nurse years inter
vention arm
Frontline providers similarly described how protocols
and reminders improved clinical processes for them
With the CDSS if a client s BP blood pressure is
high it will ask you to recheck and if it is still high
it will ask you to do something for the client either
you refer or detain With the paper based protocols
most often you just skip these vital things CDSS also
makes it easy to access previous patient s history
Midwife years Intervention arm
For PNC postnatal care after delivery you have to
check the woman frequently min min h for
h and at the end you can know the woman is now
well Midwife years intervention arm
Many health workers connected process improve
ments with improved maternal outcomes either through
Page of
women receiving all required services and treatments or
through encouraging earlier referrals
It has reduced maternal deaths because if a woman
comes and you monitor to a certain level the CDSS
will just tell you to refer and so it makes us to refer
early Midwife years intervention arm
Municipal and district managers had similar perspec
tives on the advantages of CDSS As one noted
with the paper based protocols they are mostly in
their cabinets and not on their tables and that make
them feel lazy using them but this one makes you
alert as you are entering the data while reviewing
the protocol Without the protocol some even refer
cases that they are not supposed to refer Ihe CDSS
has improved the midwives knowledge and helps
them refer clients early Quality of maternal health
care has improved because you don t do things in the
abstract Municipal Public Health Nurse years
intervention arm
Several managers also described specific benefits of
PBIs As another noted
Health workers were behaving negatively towards
work but the PBI intervention has come to improve
on it For the first time it was introduced they were
not serious because they didn t know there will be
awards but when the first award ceremony came
they became serious and when they go to work they
are actually busy District Public Health Nurse
years intervention arm
Challenges to CDSS use
Alongside perceived improvements intervention par
ticipants described challenges in using CDSS Some
appeared relatively easily addressable such as software
requiring administration of only one malaria IPT to preg
nant women and increased workloads as nurses and mid
wives still had to complete facility forms in addition to
CDSS data screens Others were more challenging such
as faulty electronic partograph leading to unnecessary
referrals and power fluctuations affecting software use
The IPT gap was a common complaint
are certain things in the CDSS that should be
improved Ihe IPT should be first second and third
It s only once in the CDSS Midwife years inter
vention arm
Most frontline health workers found it annoying and
time consuming to complete both CDSS data screens
and paper documentation
Aninanya et al BMC Health Services Research
It has also increased our workload because we have
to use the computer and attend to the woman and
at the same time enter it into the book Midwife
years intervention facility
Some midwives suggested that maternity clients also
found this annoying
Ihe only complaint they clients give is that they
keep long because you enter their personal infor
mation into the maternal book and afterwards you
enter the same information into the CDSS Mid
wife years intervention arm
Some also suggested that added form filling distracted
from patient care
In fact to use the computer to monitor a patient is
sometimes difficult it doesn t need one person Ifa
woman is in labour you can t come to the computer
again Midwife years intervention arm
Many health workers noted that the CDSS partograph
required too many referrals
If you want to follow the partographs strictly on the
CDSS you will end up referring all your delivery cli
ents Midwives years intervention arm
All noted that CDSS equipment s short battery life and
reliance on electricity could be problematic
Sometimes too if there is light out and the battery
is down you can t use it for patient care Midwife
years intervention arm
Suggestions for improving provider performance
Other than addressing the issues highlighted above sug
gestions for improving performance came from com
parison arm participants Interestingly all comparison
participants reported some performance improvements
the study was not blinded but noted considerable need
for further improvement However when asked whether
they knew anything about CDSS or PBIs or how these
worked most said no and were thus not questioned fur
ther about the intervention Instead the issues they dis
cussed were primarily about the challenges they faced in
their work and how these could be addressed Despite
their lack of reported knowledge all comparison health
workers requested PBIs along with more promotion
opportunities and staff to spread the workload and
described the need for protocols phone based guide
lines and equipment e g test kits blood pressure appa
ratus haemoglobin machines to enhance their work
lhere is a slight improvement in performance but
there is still more room for improvement Protocols

and incentives that are supposed to enhance our
performance are inadequate Midwife years

Comparison area managers reiterated frontline per
spectives with poor partograph use in comparison facili
ties highlighted
Performance is moderate because we don t have
the requisite protocols in the facility to make clini
cal decisions Partograph utilization is poor in most
cases Community health offcer years compar

All comparison health workers advocated for access to

Authorities should introduce electronic decision
support systems to enhance patient based care
Midwife years comparison arm
Comparison managers expressed the same wish to have
the CDSS PBI intervention in their facilities
All facilities should have computers where the pro
viders can also learn new protocols in maternal and
neonatal health services through the internet Ihey
should be trained on how to use these computers
to monitor labour and they should be given finan

Discussion
This qualitative study examined frontline and mana
gerial perspectives of CDSS combined with a PBI
intervention indicating perceived improvements in
health worker performance and conditions as com
pared to comparison arm counterparts CDSS appeared
to enhance provider knowledge of maternal health
issues and health education messaging support care
provision through reminders and protocols and
increase referrals This was despite baseline research
Aninanya et al BMC Health Services Research
suggesting very limited technological knowledge
among these providers Several intensive train
ings and supportive supervision equipped health work
ers with the necessary technical skills to use computers
for maternal care as also shown in Canada This
reinforces research findings on the benefits of CDSS for
MNH provider performance and implies that
contributions to achieving SDG and universal health
coverage UHC could invest in such interventions
to enhance health worker performance
Comparison area participants on the contrary
reported commensurately smaller improvements with
suggestions for additional changes that likely related
to other simultaneous MNH initiatives in Upper
East region Interestingly suggestions for
improvement were all from comparison facilities and
despite indicating their lack of awareness of CDSS and
P Bls they expressed considerable interest This sug
gests that the concepts of CDSS and P Bls were quite
popular with or without explicit knowledge of either
intervention It is thus worth noting that comparison
participants recommended CDSS PBI intervention
components be introduced in their facilities to
further improve performance e g protocols on their
mobile phones incentives along with essential sup
plies and equipment such as test kits blood pressure
apparatus This supports evidence from other settings
on the perceived benefits of CDSS and P Bls to improve
performance
While it was not possible to confirm the maternal mor
tality improvements reported by participants recent evi
dence showed this intervention improved antenatal and
delivery clients satisfaction with care Increased
satisfaction suggests services attitudes or both had
improved Additionally use of relevant clinical
guidelines was reportedly high among intervention
health workers while earlier research in the area showed
this as poor Thus improved access to and
required use of clinical protocols and guidelines as part
of CDSS in intervention facilities likely meant improved
quality of care and reduced clinical errors as indicated
in other research on use of computerized guidelines to
reduce errors and epidemiological research in Ghana
and other LMICs
What this study does show is that despite some oper
ational challenges e g software glitches electricity
health workers reported job satisfaction and quality of
care improved with the introduction of the CDSS PBI
intervention This is promising though further research
is needed on intervention cost effectiveness and sus
tainability before any policy decision should be taken on
wider implementation
Page of
Strengths and limitations
The study fills a gap in knowledge as there are no stud
ies on the combined effects of these interventions on
health workers care providers performance How
ever several limitations should be considered when
interpreting the findings First while the focus was on
CDSS both CDSS and PBI were running concurrently
it was not feasible to assess the two intervention com
ponents separately Second the qualitative results pre
sent just the perceptions of health professionals with
regards to the intervention a mixed method approach
would have created an opportunity to collect both
qualitative and quantitative data at the same time and
would have offset weaknesses associated with using one
method
Conclusion
Findings indicated predominantly positive perceptions of
the CDSS PBI intervention helped improve MNH care
provider performance in the Upper East Region CDSS
and P Bls have potential to improve frontline health
workers motivation and adherence to clinical guidelines
However while this combined intervention shows prom
ise for longer term or wider implementation context
and perspectives must be considered when developing
implementing and assessing any performance improve
ment intervention Thus further research is still required
to assess the cost effectiveness and sustainability of per
formance improvements

Abstract
Objective
To determine the clinical manifestations risk factors
and maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant and
recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed
coronavirus disease covid
DESIGN
Living systematic review and meta analysis
DATA SOURCES
Medline Embase Cochrane database WHO COVID
database China National Knowledge Infrastructure
CNKI and Wanfang databases from December
to April along with preprint servers
social media and reference lists
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Pregnant women are considered to be a high risk group for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV infection and the potential
adverse effects of the virus on maternal and perinatal outcomes are of concern
In non pregnant populations admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease
covid the most common symptoms are fever cough and dyspnoea
reported in more than two thirds of individuals
Advancing age high body mass index non white ethnicity and pre existing
comorbidities are risk factors for severe covid in the general population
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid diagnosed in hospital are
less likely to manifest symptoms of fever cough dyspnoea and myalgia than
non pregnant women of reproductive age
Pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid are at increased risk of
admission to an intensive care unit receiving invasive ventilation or death
compared with non pregnant women of reproductive age with covid
Risk factors for severe disease in pregnancy include increasing maternal age
high body mass index non white ethnicity pre existing comorbidities and
pregnancy specific disorders such as gestational diabetes and pre eclampsia
Pregnant women with covid are more likely to experience preterm birth and
their neonates are more likely to be stillborn or admitted to a neonatal unit
Pregnant women with covid had an absolute risk increase for admission to
intensive care unit preterm birth caesarean section and admission of their
neonates to neonatal unit compared with pregnant women without covid

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION
PROSPERO
READERS NOTE
This article is a living systematic review that will
be updated to reflect emerging evidence Updates
may occur for up to two years from the date of
original publication This version is update of the
original article published on September BMJ
and previous updates can be
found as data supplements https www bmj com

citing this paper please consider adding the update
number and date of access for clarity
Introduction
Since the first report December of the novel
coronavirus disease covid caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
SARS CoV the number of confirmed cases and
associated mortality and morbidity have increased
rapidly Pregnant women are considered a high
risk group because of concerns about the effect of
covid on them during and after pregnancy and
on their neonates Quantification of the rates of
covid its risk factors clinical manifestations and
outcomes is key to planning clinical maternal care and
management in an evolving pandemic scenario
Publications on covid in pregnancy have risen
steeply through individual case reports case series
observational studies and systematic reviews Since
the publication of our original living systematic
review on covid in pregnancy over reviews
have been published in this area
with many more
registered in PROSPERO
Early reviews mostly
included case reports and case series that were often
inappropriately meta analysed providing biased
estimates Subsequent reviews differed little from
each other often including similar primary studies
many with duplicate data These reviews became
quickly outdated as new evidence emerged Moreover
the sampling frames in primary studies have varied
ranging from universal SARS CoV testing for all
pregnant women admitted to hospital
to symptom
based testing
Testing strategies have also differed
within and between countries with diagnosis in
many early studies based on epidemiological risk
assessment and clinical features without confirmed
SARS CoV infection which need to be considered in
the analysis Limitations in the external and internal
validity of studies make it challenging for guideline
developers and policy makers to make evidence based
recommendations for the management of pregnant
and recently pregnant women with covid
We started this living systematic review in April
to determine the clinical manifestations of covid in
pregnant and recently pregnant women identify the
risk factors for complications and quantify maternal
and perinatal outcomes The systematic review is being
updated on a regular basis
Methods
Our systematic review is based on a prospectively
registered protocol PROSPERO
registered April to evaluate a series of
research questions on covid during and after
pregnancy We report our findings on the rates
clinical manifestations risk factors and maternal and
perinatal outcomes in women with covid in line with
the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews
and meta analyses PRISMA recommendations
see appendix As more relevant data become
available we shall answer other research questions
in our published protocol Each cycle of our living
systematic review involves weekly search updates
rounds with analysis performed every months
for reporting through a dedicated website with early
analysis if new definitive evidence emerges We are
regularly reviewing the planned frequency of updates
Literature search
Our weekly search update included a systematic
search of major databases Medline Embase Cochrane
database WHO World Health Organization COVID
database China National Knowledge Infrastructure
CNKI and Wanfang databases for relevant studies
on covid in pregnant and recently pregnant
women We also coordinated our search efforts with
the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and
Co ordinating Centre EPPI Centre WHO Library and
Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility group Additional
searches were conducted of preprint servers blogs
websites that serve as repositories for covid studies
such as the LOVE platform Living Overview of the
Evidence
social media guidelines and reference
lists of included studies For this second update of
the review we included studies from searches up to
April We contacted established groups that
were coordinating or conducting surveillance and

Study selection
Two reviewers independently selected studies using
a two stage process they first screened the titles
and abstracts of studies and then assessed the full
text of the selected studies in detail for eligibility A
total of reviewers contributed to study selection
Disagreements were resolved through discussion
with a third reviewer ST or JA We excluded studies
if the duplicated data for all outcomes of interest were
published elsewhere as reported by the study authors
or when the characteristics of the women or neonates
matched the setting characteristics and duration of
another study from the same geographical location If
there was an overlap of data or suspicion of duplicates
of participants in studies we included studies based on
their study design prioritising comparative cohorts
and sample size larger study prioritised
We defined women as having confirmed covid
if they had laboratory confirmation of SARS CoV
infection irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms
Women with a diagnosis based only on clinical or
radiological findings were defined as having suspected
covid The recently pregnant group comprised
women in the postpartum and post abortion period We
included studies that compared covid rates clinical
manifestations symptoms laboratory and radiological
results risk factors and associated mortality and
morbidity between pregnant and recently pregnant
and non pregnant women of reproductive age and
those that compared maternal and perinatal outcomes
in pregnant women with and without covid In
studies comparing maternal and perinatal outcomes
of pregnant women with covid to those without we
classified the comparative controls as being historical
if the cohort of pregnant women without covid
gave birth before December Studies on non
comparative cohorts with a minimum of participants
were included if they reported on the rates and clinical
manifestations of covid and relevant outcomes in
pregnant and recently pregnant women We defined
cohort studies as those that sampled participants on
the basis of exposure followed up participants over
time and ascertained the outcomes The PROSPERO
protocol provides a full list of the risk factors clinical
features and outcomes evaluated
The sampling frames for detecting covid included
universal screening and testing when all women were
assessed for covid using reverse transcriptase

Study quality assessment and data extraction
The quality of the comparative cohort studies was
assessed for selection comparability and outcome
ascertainment bias using the Newcastle Ottawa
scale Studies achieving four stars for selection two
for comparability and three for ascertainment of the
outcome were considered to have a low risk of bias
Studies achieving two or three stars for selection one
for comparability and two for outcome ascertainment
were considered to have a medium risk of bias
and any study achieving one star for selection or
outcome ascertainment or zero for any of the three
domains was regarded as having a high risk of bias
We assessed the quality of studies reporting on the
prevalence of clinical manifestations or outcomes for
internal and external validity using an existing tool
The following were considered as low risk of bias for
external validity representative of national population
for relevant variables population representative of
target population sampling frame random selection
selection bias and more than response rate
in individuals with and without the outcome non
response bias Two independent reviewers extracted
data using a pre piloted form
Statistical analysis
We pooled the comparative dichotomous data using
random effects meta analysis and summarised the
findings as odds ratios and risk differences with
confidence intervals To combine comparative
continuous data with dichotomous data we
transformed standardised mean differences to
logarithm odds ratios assuming a normal underlying
distribution We pooled the dichotomous non
comparative data for rates of clinical manifestations
and maternal and perinatal outcomes as proportions
with confidence intervals using Dersimonian
and Laird random effects meta analysis after
transforming data using Freeman Tukey double
arcsin transformation Heterogeneity was reported

Discussion
Findings in this second update of our living systematic
review remain consistent with our original review and
our previous update for prevalence of covid rates
of clinical manifestations and outcomes in pregnant
and recently pregnant women in studies published
before the predominance of SARS CoV variants of
concern One in pregnant or recently pregnant
women who are attending or admitted to hospital for
any reason were diagnosed as having suspected or
confirmed covid and the rates varied by sampling
strategy Pregnant and recently pregnant women were
less likely to show covid related symptoms of fever
dyspnoea cough and myalgia than non pregnant
women with covid Although testing for SARS
CoV in non pregnant women is based on symptoms
or contact history testing in pregnant women is
usually done when they are in hospital for reasons that
might not be related to covid Pregnant or recently
thebmj I doi bmj
pregnant women with covid were at increased
risk of requiring admission to an intensive care unit
and invasive ventilation compared to non pregnant
reproductive aged women with covid Increased
maternal age high body mass index non white
ethnicity pre existing comorbidities and pregnancy
specific conditions such as pre eclampsia and
gestational diabetes are associated with severe disease
Compared to pregnant women without covid
pregnant women with covid are at increased risk of
death admission to the intensive care unit stillbirth
delivering preterm and their babies being admitted
to the neonatal unit However the overall rates of
stillbirth and neonatal death remain low in women
with suspected or confirmed covid Absolute
increases in maternal deaths admissions to the
intensive care unit preterm births caesarean sections
and admissions of babies to the neonatal unit were
observed for pregnant women with covid compared
to pregnant women without the disease Substantial
heterogeneity was observed in the estimates for rates
of clinical manifestations and outcomes which varied
by sampling frames participant selection and risk
status of the participants
This second update of the living systematic review
includes more than double the number of studies
included in the first update and four times more
pregnant women with covid There continues to
be increased precision in estimates for previously
identified risk factors for severe disease in pregnant
and recently pregnant women with covid including
stronger association between risk factors such as non
white ethnicity and pregnancy specific conditions
such as gestational diabetes and pre eclampsia and
increased risk of adverse outcomes in pregnant women
with covid than without the disease

Strengths and limitations of this review
In this unprecedented pandemic situation where
evidence is rapidly produced and published in various
formats our living systematic review underpinned by
robust methods and continually updated at regular
intervals is important for several reasons Firstly
it addresses important research questions relevant
to clinical decision making and policies Secondly
uncertainties remain for key outcomes that require
further evidence Thirdly the rapid turnover of
evidence in various formats requires assessments of
study quality and regular updating of the findings
Finally our living systematic review is producing
strong evidence base for living guidelines on covid
and pregnancy
We undertook a comprehensive search and
coordinated our efforts with key organisations and
research groups such as WHO US CDC Cochrane Centre
and EPPI Centre To minimise risk of bias we restricted
our meta analysis to cohort studies and we reported
the quality of the included studies By contacting
the authors and obtaining reports not published in
PubMed we minimised the risk of missing relevant
studies Our systematic review has a large sample size
and it is continuously increasing Our living review
framework will enable us to rapidly update the findings
as new data emerge We undertook extensive work to
ensure that duplicate data are not included Our various
comparative analyses allowed us to comprehensively
assess the association between pregnancy and

covid related outcomes covid and pregnancy
outcomes risk factors for SARS CoV infection and
complications Our review helps to understand the
variations in estimates through sensitivity analyses by
sampling strategies population characteristics and
risk factors and it provides confidence in the rates of
reported outcomes The second update has allowed
us to incorporate new evidence from studies and
more than two million women published since our first
update in February
Our systematic review also has limitations
Although our search spans the entire year none
of the studies included was conducted by the time
of emergence of any SARS CoV variant of concern
Despite every effort to quickly update the evidence
the number of new studies identified and the rigor
required to remove duplicates meant that the review
did not consider current changes in the pandemic such
as variants of concern and vaccination which could
affect reported prevalence rates and presentation
The primary studies used varied sampling frames to
identify women with covid consisted of women
with suspected and confirmed covid and primarily
reported on pregnant women who required visits to
hospital including for childbirth thereby affecting
the generalisability of the estimates Although our
thebmj I doi bmj
sensitivity analyses aimed to tackle some of these
problems the numbers and sample sizes of the
individual studies were too small to identify differences
between the subgroups The timing of assessment of
the clinical manifestations of disease was generally
not available The definitions of symptoms tests
and outcomes were heterogeneous Furthermore
poor reporting of the criteria for caesarean section
admissions to the neonatal unit and the causes
of preterm birth made it diffcult to disentangle
iatrogenic effects from direct pathophysiological
effects of the disease Studies comparing maternal and
perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with covid
against historical cohorts of pregnant women could
be biased owing to differences in the environment in
which births occur During the pandemic healthcare
systems have faced increased pressure and strain on
services with resulting effects on service delivery and
quality of care
Lockdown measures physical
distancing and changes to livelihood have led to
increased depression and anxiety and reduction in
physical activity and access or attendance to healthcare
facilities and could have also contributed to maternal
and perinatal complications
Not many studies reported outcomes by trimester for
symptom onset making it difficult to assess the rates of
CD
o
RESEARCH
miscarriage and postpartum complications For some
outcomes the findings were influenced by a few large
studies
Comparison with existing evidence
Between the publication of the first update of the living
systematic review and this second update estimates
for the prevalence of covid and rates of clinical
manifestations and outcomes of pregnant and recently
pregnant women with covid have remained similar
with a slight reduction in rates and improved precision
in findings We found a reduction in caesarean section
rates and admission to the neonatal unit compared
with the first update which could be attributed
to increasing knowledge of the disease and better
healthcare practices The rate of maternal pneumonia
appears to also be lower High heterogeneity remains
in the estimates for rates of clinical manifestations and
outcomes
We found that the same risk factors for severe covid
identified in the original version and first update of
the living systematic review remained associated
with severe covid in this second update with
increased precision Our findings on the association
of severe covid with ethnic minority status in
pregnant women are consistent with similar reports
of disproportionately high rates of severe covid
in non pregnant ethnic minority populations and
disparities in other areas of maternity care by ethnic
The observed disparity could be
minority status
attributed to associated comorbidities socioeconomic
characteristics and factors related to access to and
quality of care in the preconception pregnancy and
postpartum periods The multifaceted contributors
to ethnic disparities need to be investigated to reduce
mortality and morbidity related to both covid and
pregnancy This latest version of our review update
also identified an increased risk of caesarean section
neonatal death and stillbirth in pregnant women with
covid compared to pregnant women without the
disease
Alongside the spread of the pandemic a shift has
occurred in the types of studies published with initial
studies involving pregnant women from epidemic
regions in China followed by reports of large regional
and national datasets from the US UK Netherlands
Spain and Latin American countries However few
reports have come from African countries The study
design has also changed from initial small case series
and case reports to large observational data with
recent studies also providing comparative data
The prevalence of covid varied widely between
studies particularly when sampling was done based
on symptoms or history of contact highlighting the
variations in criteria for testing The current update of
our living systematic review includes twice as many
studies as our first update on the overall prevalence
of covid in pregnancy Despite the addition of
more studies from diverse populations globally the
prevalence of covid in pregnant and recently
pregnant women remains unchanged Unlike the
general population who are mostly tested for SARS
CoV based on symptoms or contact history universal
screening of all pregnant women attending the hospital
for any reason could contribute to the consistency in
the findings However the true prevalence of covid
in pregnancy is likely to be lower than the current
estimate if all pregnant women including those not
attending the hospital are included
Despite the potential higher possibility of universal
screening to detect pregnant women with mild disease
we observed an increase in admissions to the intensive
care unit and need for invasive ventilation compared
with non pregnant women of reproductive age with
covid These results were mainly influenced by
the large US CDC report the Canadian Surveillance
of covid in pregnancy report and a report from
the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology
registry
By accessing the unpublished data from our
collaborators we were able to include women
both with and without symptoms from the US CDC
surveillance data in addition to the women with
symptoms only who were included in the published
report Pregnancy status was not ascertained in
a large proportion of women of reproductive age in
the CDC report which could affect the estimates
Furthermore the outcomes for which the data were
missing from the report were considered to be absent in
women potentially leading to bias The report from the
Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology registry
remains available only as a preprint and included only
women with symptoms who might be at higher risk of
complications Non pregnant women in the Canadian
Surveillance report included women years of age
compared to years in the pregnant women group
We recommend that studies comparing covid
related outcomes in pregnant versus non pregnant
women report the relevant estimates for both women
with and without symptoms to avoid overestimation of
the risk of complications due to selective reporting The
pooled estimates for severe covid and admission to
an intensive care unit were however still relatively
high in the non comparative data indicative of a
potential increased risk in pregnancy This is supported
by an analysis in a Swedish study suggesting a high
risk of admission to an intensive care unit and invasive
ventilation in pregnant women compared to non
pregnant women and similar results reported in a
recent French national cohort study suggesting higher
risk of mortality admission to intensive care unit and
pregnancy related complications in pregnant women
with covid compared to pregnant women without
the disease
Similar to the general population high body mass
index and pre existing comorbidity seemed to be risk
factors for severity of covid in pregnancy including
admission to an intensive care unit and invasive
ventilation Complications related to covid did
not seem to be increased in women presenting in
the third trimester versus earlier in pregnancy or in
multiparous versus primiparous women but existing

sample sizes are not large Both chronic hypertension
and pre existing diabetes were associated with
maternal death in pregnant women with covid
which are known risk factors for death in the general
population But it is not known if covid was
the direct cause of death for these women and the
numbers of studies are small
We observed an increase in rates of preterm birth
in pregnant women with covid compared with
pregnant women without the disease These preterm
births could have been medically indicated owing
to maternal disease and resulting fetal distress as
the overall rates of spontaneous preterm births in
pregnant women with covid was broadly similar
to those observed in the pre pandemic period The
overall rates of stillbirths and neonatal deaths were
still relatively low with the absolute differences for
stillbirth not significant between the groups A recent
report from the US CDC found that relative risk of
stillbirth with covid in pregnant women increased
significantly after circulation of the delta variant in the
US from an adjusted relative risk of before delta
dominance to during delta dominance Rates
of adverse outcomes should continue to be monitored
as new SARS CoV variants continue to emerge Local
policies on observation and quarantine of infants
with exposure to SARS CoV might have influenced
admission rates to the neonatal unit which was lower
in this second update than in our first update
Relevance for clinical practice and research
Based on existing data healthcare professionals
should be aware that pregnant and recently pregnant
women with covid might manifest fewer symptoms
than the general population with the overall pattern
similar to that of the general population Pregnant
women should be informed of the increase in severity
of covid including admission to intensive care units
and invasive ventilation compared with non pregnant
women and should be encouraged to undertake safety
measures to reduce the risk of infection including
receiving the covid vaccine to reduce risk of
severe disease Pregnant women with pre existing
comorbidities will need to be considered as a high risk
group for covid along with those who are obese
and of older maternal age Healthcare professionals
need to be aware of the increased risk of severe disease
in pregnant and recently pregnant women of non
white ethnic origin to plan close monitoring and have
a low threshold for escalation of care Clinicians will
need to balance the need for regular multidisciplinary
antenatal care to manage women with pre existing
comorbidities against unnecessary exposure to the
virus through virtual clinic appointments when
possible Pregnant women with covid before term
gestation might need to be managed in a unit with
facilities to care for preterm neonates
Further data are still needed to robustly assess the
association between pregnancy specific risk factors
such as pre eclampsia and gestational diabetes
and covid related outcomes Robust collection

RESEARCH
of maternal data by trimester of exposure including
the periconception period is required to determine
the effects of covid on early pregnancy outcomes
fetal growth and risk of miscarriage or stillbirth We
need detailed reporting of outcomes by ethnicity to
quantify the risk of severe covid in women from
different ethnicities Qualitative studies on behaviour
and attitude to the pandemic can help to disentangle
the relative importance of factors behind the ethnic
disparities observed in the severity of covid
Understanding and dealing with inequities in social
determinants of health that put ethnic minority groups
at higher risk of severe disease can help improve
outcomes in this group
Evidence syntheses on covid faces unprecedented
unique challenges even for agile designs such as
living systematic reviews Firstly there is rapid change
in the nature of the virus with emerging variants
of concern with varied infectivity presentation
and outcomes Primary studies in non pregnant
and pregnant populations suggest increased risk of
hospital admission and death with the alpha and
delta variants of concern compared with the wildtype
However the timeline of most of the
variant
published literature lags with regards to the emerging
variants of concern As we update our search beyond
the pre variant period we are likely to encounter
new studies reporting on pregnancies before and
after the emergence of variants In such instances it
will be inappropriate to update our meta analysis by
combining all studies
Secondly countries are rapidly rolling out covid
immunisation programmes which affects the
prevalence presentation and outcomes in general and
pregnant populations Similar to the methodological
challenges with the variants it is also inappropriate
to update our meta analysis without considering
vaccination status
Thirdly our living systematic review aims to
synthesise evidence rapidly as they emerge However
many primary studies publish partially duplicated
data published elsewhere or at different time points
or report different categories of outcomes for the same
participants in multiple journals Furthermore large
numbers of non peer reviewed scientific papers and
reports are available in the public domain in multiple
versions Because primary studies do not often
explicitly state if duplicate data have been included
we had to undertake resource intensive efforts to check
each included study against all studies published
since the beginning of the pandemic to avoid double
counting of participants This approach led to delays
between completion of the search and finalisation of
data for analysis
With the establishment of several national and
global prospective cohorts we expect the sample
size of our meta analysis to increase further in the
coming months Future reviews will need to consider
the effects of variants of concerns on the rates of
coivd manifestation of symptoms and the risk
of covid and pregnancy related complications in

o
RESEARCH
pregnant and recently pregnant women In doing so
we propose a shift in how the findings are reported In
order to capture the trends in prevalence presentation
and outcomes of SARS CoV in pregnancy in line
with the changing environment in terms of variants
and vaccination status we plan to synthesise and
present the data according to the time of recruitment
of participants rather than the traditional update by
timing of publication Providing such data in half
yearly intervals alongside information on the trends
in variants and vaccine status would provide accurate
information reflecting the underlying conditions
Including vaccination information within global
systematic reviews of covid and pregnancy will
also allow collection of data on the range of covid
vaccines that are in use in different settings which
can inform international guidelines on vaccination
in pregnancy This information could lead to stronger
recommendations on covid vaccination for all
pregnant women and help combat misinformation on
vaccination in pregnancy

ABSTRACT
Background Studies on the health effects of metal mixtures typically utilize biomarkers measured in a single
biological medium such as blood or urine However the ability to evaluate mixture effects are limited by the
uncertainty whether a unified medium can fully capture exposure for each metal Therefore it is important to
compare and assess metal mixtures measured in different media in epidemiology studies
Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the mixture predictive performance of urine and blood metal
biomarkers and integrated multi media biomarkers in association with birth outcomes
Methods In our analysis of women from the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort we measured essential and
non essential metals in repeated and paired samples of urine and blood during pregnancy For each metal we
integrated exposure estimates from paired urine and blood biomarkers into multi media biomarkers MMBs
using intraclass correlation coefficient ICC and weighted quantile sum WQS approaches Using Ridge re
gressions four separate Environmental risk scores ERSs for metals in urine blood and MMBvvQs were
computed as a weighted sum of the metal concentrations We then examined associations between urine
blood and multi media biomarker ERSs and birth outcomes using linear and logistic regressions adjusting for
maternal age maternal education pre pregnancy body mass index BMI and second hand smoke exposure The
performance of each ERS was evaluated with continuous and tertile estimates and confidence intervals of
the odds ratio of preterm birth using area under the curve AUC
Results Pb was the most important contributor of blood ERS as well as the two integrated multi media biomarker
ERSs Individuals with high ERS tertile showed increased odds of preterm birth compared to individuals
with low ERS tertile with fold CI to for urine specific gravity corrected fold
CI to for blood fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using ICC
and fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using WQS The four ERSs had
comparable predictive performances AUC ranging from to when urine is examined with specific
gravity corrected concentrations
Conclusions Within a practical metal panel measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture Applications in practical study design require validation of these
methods with other cohorts larger panels of metals and within the context of other adverse health effects of
interest

Introduction
Exposure biomonitoring which estimates human exposure by
measuring chemical or other agents of interest or their metabolic
products in different biologic media such as blood and urine Strimbu
has become a fundamental approach used in exposure
and Tavel
assessment and environmental epidemiology
Burke et al
With
growing interest in the realistic scenario of studying the collective ef
fects of environmental chemicals on humans including metals Taylor
et al Kim et al Signes Pastor et al Govarts et al
Luo et al Lee et al Braun et al Berger et al
Kalioo et al
biomonitoring has become indispensable in
studies of mixtures Due to limiting factors such as financial cost and
methodologic challenges mixture studies based on biomarkers typically
use a unified human specimen i e blood urine etc to determine
exposure to various chemicals Singh et al Martin and Griswold
Borowska and Brzoska Rehman et al Gorman Ng
et al Ashrap et al
While this approach may capture
overall exposure to a class of chemicals with similar structure and
pharmacokinetic properties such as urinary phthalates and blood per
fluorinated compounds PFAS it is more challenging to evaluate
chemical classes such as metals Because each metal possesses different
pharmacokinetic properties utilizing one medium for measuring metal
mixtures may not represent exposure for each metal or accurately reflect
overall human exposure Moreover for different metals each medium
may also represent a different window of exposure that provides
important information in relation to the health outcome of interest
A set of biomarkers reflecting integrated metal mixture information
from multiple media not only reduces the error in the exposure esti
mation but also captures different exposure sources and pathways
Thus it may be appropriate to combine exposure from different media to
assess human exposure to both single metal and metal mixtures Previ
ous studies have proposed different techniques to integrate biomarkers
of exposure to single chemicals including confirmatory factor analysis
Budtz et al Grandjean and Budtz
structural equation models Grandjean and Budtz Kim
et al Heilmann et al and the derivation of multi media
biomarkers MMBs through mixture methods non negative matrix
factorization NMF independent component analysis ICA and
weighted quantile sum WQS regression Levin Schwartz et al
A few studies have modeled metal mixtures measured in multiple
matrices simultaneously and demonstrated that a combination of
different metal biomarker factors may improve the prediction of health
outcomes Rechtman et al Bauer et al Those studies have
validated techniques to select the most important biomarker for each
exposure individually which has provided useful information for rec
ommending a more suitable biomarker for a single metal To our
knowledge very few epidemiological studies have evaluated the overall
performance of simple metal mixtures up to metals measured in
different media in association with health outcomes Levin Schwartz
et al Sanders et al
Therefore our goals were to assess
whether data on a wide panel of metal mixture exposures measured
using different media can be integrated and compare the performance of
different matrices when assessing the relationship between metal mix
tures and birth outcomes
To achieve this goal we conducted the following study First we
proposed ways to integrate multi media exposure information from
biomarkers measured in different media Second we assessed the per
formance of metal mixtures measured in different media and the com
bined multi media exposure as related to health outcomes We chose
adverse birth outcomes as our outcome of interest because exposure to
metals impacts various biological pathways that contribute to adverse
birth outcomes including preterm delivery and low birthweight Kim

Limited mixture studies
on this topic have mostly focused on metals measured in either urine or
blood
Kim et al Signes Pastor et al Govarts et al
Luo et al Lee et al In the Puerto Rico PROTECT study we
measured a wide range of metals in paired urine and blood samples
which enabled us to compare the associations between adverse birth
outcomes and urinary or blood metal mixtures as well as integrated
metal mixtures utilizing both matrices We hypothesized that the use of
urine blood and the integrated metal mixtures would demonstrate
differing performance when modeling adverse birth outcomes inform
ing more efficient study designs for exposure assessment
Methods
Study population
This study used data collected from pregnant women partici
pating in the PROTECT study an ongoing prospective birth cohort
Cantonwine et al Meeker et al Watkins et al
Ashrap et al
The PROTECT study was launched in with
funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
NIEHS Superfund Research Program to investigate Puerto Rico s high
preterm birth rate and the extent of hazardous waste contamination on
the island PROTECT aims to explore environmental exposures and other
factors contributing to preterm birth risk and other adverse birth out
comes in Puerto Rico
Study participants were recruited at approximately weeks of
gestation at seven prenatal clinics and hospitals throughout Northern
Puerto Rico and followed until delivery Cantonwine et al
Pregnant women included in the study were aged
Meeker et al
between and years resided inside of the Northern Karst aquifer
region and were planning to deliver in the participating hospitals
Exclusion of participants included the use of oral contraceptives within
the three months prior to pregnancy use of in vitro fertilization to
become pregnant or any major medical or obstetrical complications
including pre existing diabetes Ashrap et al Each woman
participated in a total of up to three study visits during weeks
weeks and weeks of gestation At the initial visit detailed
information on medical and pregnancy history was collected
Nurse administered questionnaires were used to gather information on
housing characteristics employment status and family situation at an
in home visit weeks Spot urine samples were collected from
women at up to three visits and blood samples were collected during the
first and third visits A total of women who delivered a live singleton
birth had available data on paired urine and blood metal biomarkers
collected at the same time point as well as information on covariates

Kim et al The
laboratory selected the appropriate isotopes for the requested elements
to best avoid interferences from high levels of carbon and chloride in the
biological sample matrix The ICPMS was calibrated with a blank and a
minimum of standards for each element of interest An value of

The calibration curves were verified by initial checks at three calibration
points within the curve Continuing calibration checks and blanks after
every samples were also utilized throughout the analytical run to
ensure the ICPMS system was maintaining acceptable performance

that were measured in paired media have both urinary and blood

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all exposures and outcome

transformation Spearman s rank correlations rs were used for the
analysis of the relationships between paired urinary and blood metal

MMB composition
In this analysis we proposed two approaches to integrate exposure
information from urinary and blood metal measurements into a multi
media biomarker MMB In the first approach inspired by the
concept of cue combination in quantitative cognitive neurosciences the
minimum variance unbiased estimator for multiple sources of informa
tion we used an internal reliability indicator of the biomarkers to
integrate MMB unsupervised method In the second approach which is
a supervised method weighted quantile sum WQS models were used
because the relative contribution of the individual biomarkers to the
overall exposure and health outcome association is easier to interpret
than many other mixtures methods The details of the approaches are
described below
Integrating multi media biomarker MMB using intraclass corre
lation coefficient ICC Characterizing the within and between
individual variation of measurements with parameters such as intra
class correlation coefficient ICC gives information on the reliability of
the different media biomarkers ICC is defined as the proportion of the
Wi l
total variance that is attributed to between individual variability

where w is the weight of a medium Wurinegcq VVblood l expresses
whether a certain medium urine or blood as a biomarker for a
particular metal is a relatively reliable biomarker and C is the geometric
average of metal concentration
Integrating multi media biomarker MMB using weighted quantile
sum regression WQS In addition to the unsupervised learning method
the amount of exposure information each biomarker carries can be
quantified simultaneously based on the relationship of the exposure
measured in a certain medium and health effect a supervised approach
Therefore the second approach for integrating urinary and blood bio
markers was weighted quantile sum regression WQS which models
the body burden of quantiles of exposure WQS estimates a set of
weights such that the linear combinations of the weights quantile
biomarkers have the highest association with the outcome Carrico
et al
equation Details of the WQS equation and annotations
are previously described Yorita Christensen et al In our anal
ysis Wi is the unknown weight for the ith medium urine blood
c z represents a vector of adjusted covariates and P is a vector of
regression coefficients for those covariates By placing the constraints of
the weight WD estimates to be non negative and sum to the
comparative values of urine and blood metals to multi media bio
markers and the joint effect can be determined The weights can then be
used to quantify the contribution of each medium to the multi media
biomarker In this supervised learning approach we used WQS
bootstraps to determine the association between each birth outcome
and urinary and blood biomarkers of each metal separately A pre
liminary analysis was conducted before the construction of WQS models
As WQS assumes linearity in an effort to detect potential non linear
relationships between individual metals and birth outcomes we used
generalized additive models GAM to graphically depict the metal and
birth outcome relationship Results from GAM including metal concen
trations as splines and the GAM output graphics showed that when the
smoothing estimator is significant the observed associations are linear
estimated degree of freedom Therefore we proceeded with WQS
All outcomes were regressed on the geometric averages of SG corrected

Single pollutant analysis
In epidemiological studies with repeated measurements the ICC
metric ranging from O to indicates reliability among multiple mea
surements of a quantity when close to O ICC reflects large variations
between repeated measures a k a poor ability to distinguish between
individuals with high and low exposure levels when close to the
repeated measures are close to each other which reflects a good ability to
discriminate between individuals with high and low exposure levels In
this unsupervised machine learning approach we utilized the ICCs
calculated from repeated measurements of SG corrected urinary up to
three visits and blood metals up to two visits Ashrap et al as
weighting parameters to construct an integrated MMB separately for
each metal using equations

Generalized linear models GLM were used to examine the associ
ations between four types of metal biomarkers measured and composed
urinary blood and MMBwQs and birth outcomes Separate
models were used for each metal biomarker and outcome e g Mn
and gestational age As both MMBs described above are
composed using the geometric mean of SG corrected urinary and blood
metal concentrations geometric average concentrations across all the
available visits were also used for individual urinary and blood models
in this single pollutant analysis Geometric mean of urinary blood and
MMB biomarker concentrations were split in to tertiles risk stratifica
tion purposes The full models included the tertiles of metal biomarker
concentrations and a final set of covariates that were selected based on a
priori knowledge and whether their inclusion appreciably changed the
effect estimates of metal exposure Ashrap et al These cova

Mixture analysis
Construction of environmental risk scores ERSs using ridge
regression Environmental Risk Score ERS was proposed as a potential
summary measure for the effects of mixtures in epidemiologic research
Park et al
The concept of ERS is to build a predictive risk model
as a weighted sum of the exposure levels from simultaneous assessment
of the all the pollutants in the mixture Weights are determined by the
magnitudes standardized regression coefficients of the association
between each exposure and the outcome of interest
Park et al
We constructed Environmental Risk Scores ERSs as weighted summary
measures of the effects of metals where the weights were regression
coefficients derived from models of the association between metal
mixtures and the outcome of interest We utilized Ridge regression to
guide the weight of each metal in relation to preterm birth Ridge

commonly used supervised machine learning solutions

The in
dividual associations are not constrained to be in the same direction in
Ridge regression Therefore Ridge regression was ideal in this setting as
our analytic purpose was to evaluate the same full set of metals as
mixtures across different media and integrated biomarkers that have
different directions of individual metal birth outcome associations
Using Ridge regression with an underlying model including biomarkers
of metals and covariates we performed fold cross validation and
selected the value that minimized the cross validated sum of squared
residuals

metal exposure From a risk stratification perspective integration of
urine and blood biomarkers that were derived from both ICC and WQS
approaches improved the model performance in the mixture models
compared to the sole urine or blood biomarker models Although the
confidence intervals for these odds ratio estimates were wider the MMB
integration especially using the WQS approach resulted in substantially
higher effect estimate This finding supports that while multiple mea
surements of the exposure mixture may measure metal body burden
differentially there may still be room for improvement for exposure
measurement error structure and effect estimate when incorporating
urinary and blood biomarker information
Strengths and limitations
Specific strengths of our study include its longitudinal design in
which repeated urinary and blood biomarkers provided more accurate
exposure information during pregnancy This allowed us to quantify the
temporal reliability of the two media measurements ICCs which were
further used as weights to integrate the multi media measure of expo
sure Secondly this study utilized data driven machine learning ap
proaches to inform the composition of multi media metal biomarkers
measured in different media and guide the construction of environ
mental risk scores for each medium reflecting the overall exposure to the
metal mixture Finally this study evaluated the health effects of multiple
metals simultaneously and compared the performance of different
media biomarkers and integrated biomarkers in relation to adverse birth
outcomes in the context of a mixture The results lay the groundwork for
future epidemiological studies on biomarker selection when examining
the mixture effects of metals
However our study has several limitations The relatively small
sample size did not allow cross validation within this population on ERS
which may have caused overfitting of ERS Future studies with a larger
sample size should implement training and test datasets to cross validate
ERSs Studies with larger sample sizes are also needed to address po
tential improvement of models by including non linear terms and in
teractions between metals and covariates that were not accounted for in
the current analysis Depending on the pharmacokinetics of each
chemical within a family mixture studies in general are challenged by
the complications of combining chemical biomarkers where each may
be representing a unique window of exposure While our ERS estimates
also suffered from this limitation by combining multi media exposure
using both urine and blood biomarkers we were able to reduce the
measurement error in the mixture analysis to an extent Because the
average concentrations of metal biomarkers across three visits were used
in this analysis windows of vulnerability during pregnancy were not
evaluated Given that associations between metal mixtures and birth
outcomes may depend on developmental time windows it is important
for future longitudinal studies to evaluate the temporality of the asso
ciations In addition while we evaluated a mixture of essential and
non essential metals it is possible that other metals that were not
assessed in our study affect the performance of urine or blood bio
markers Future work is needed to expand the mixture evaluation to
include more metals and other biospecimens including hair and saliva
as well as other adverse health outcomes because our results may not be
generalizable to other outcomes of interest Finally while the mixture of
metals in this study is representative of exposures experienced by Puerto
Rican populations it may not accurately reflect exposure profiles for
other populations
Conclusions
Our study used innovative methodology to provide new detailed
insights into the individual and integrated associations of urinary and
blood mixture biomarkers of metal exposure with birth outcomes Our
investigation demonstrates within practical metal analytical panels
that measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good

ABSTRACT
Background Studies on the health effects of metal mixtures typically utilize biomarkers measured in a single
biological medium such as blood or urine However the ability to evaluate mixture effects are limited by the
uncertainty whether a unified medium can fully capture exposure for each metal Therefore it is important to
compare and assess metal mixtures measured in different media in epidemiology studies
Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the mixture predictive performance of urine and blood metal
biomarkers and integrated multi media biomarkers in association with birth outcomes
Methods In our analysis of women from the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort we measured essential and
non essential metals in repeated and paired samples of urine and blood during pregnancy For each metal we
integrated exposure estimates from paired urine and blood biomarkers into multi media biomarkers MMBs
using intraclass correlation coefficient ICC and weighted quantile sum WQS approaches Using Ridge re
gressions four separate Environmental risk scores ERSs for metals in urine blood and MMBvvQs were
computed as a weighted sum of the metal concentrations We then examined associations between urine
blood and multi media biomarker ERSs and birth outcomes using linear and logistic regressions adjusting for
maternal age maternal education pre pregnancy body mass index BMI and second hand smoke exposure The
performance of each ERS was evaluated with continuous and tertile estimates and confidence intervals of
the odds ratio of preterm birth using area under the curve AUC
Results Pb was the most important contributor of blood ERS as well as the two integrated multi media biomarker
ERSs Individuals with high ERS tertile showed increased odds of preterm birth compared to individuals
with low ERS tertile with fold CI to for urine specific gravity corrected fold
CI to for blood fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using ICC
and fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using WQS The four ERSs had
comparable predictive performances AUC ranging from to when urine is examined with specific
gravity corrected concentrations
Conclusions Within a practical metal panel measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture Applications in practical study design require validation of these
methods with other cohorts larger panels of metals and within the context of other adverse health effects of
interest

Introduction
Exposure biomonitoring which estimates human exposure by
measuring chemical or other agents of interest or their metabolic
products in different biologic media such as blood and urine Strimbu
has become a fundamental approach used in exposure
and Tavel
assessment and environmental epidemiology
Burke et al
With
growing interest in the realistic scenario of studying the collective ef
fects of environmental chemicals on humans including metals Taylor
et al Kim et al Signes Pastor et al Govarts et al
Luo et al Lee et al Braun et al Berger et al
Kalioo et al
biomonitoring has become indispensable in
studies of mixtures Due to limiting factors such as financial cost and
methodologic challenges mixture studies based on biomarkers typically
use a unified human specimen i e blood urine etc to determine
exposure to various chemicals Singh et al Martin and Griswold
Borowska and Brzoska Rehman et al Gorman Ng
et al Ashrap et al
While this approach may capture
overall exposure to a class of chemicals with similar structure and
pharmacokinetic properties such as urinary phthalates and blood per
fluorinated compounds PFAS it is more challenging to evaluate
chemical classes such as metals Because each metal possesses different
pharmacokinetic properties utilizing one medium for measuring metal
mixtures may not represent exposure for each metal or accurately reflect
overall human exposure Moreover for different metals each medium
may also represent a different window of exposure that provides
important information in relation to the health outcome of interest
A set of biomarkers reflecting integrated metal mixture information
from multiple media not only reduces the error in the exposure esti
mation but also captures different exposure sources and pathways
Thus it may be appropriate to combine exposure from different media to
assess human exposure to both single metal and metal mixtures Previ
ous studies have proposed different techniques to integrate biomarkers
of exposure to single chemicals including confirmatory factor analysis
Budtz et al Grandjean and Budtz
structural equation models Grandjean and Budtz Kim
et al Heilmann et al and the derivation of multi media
biomarkers MMBs through mixture methods non negative matrix
factorization NMF independent component analysis ICA and
weighted quantile sum WQS regression Levin Schwartz et al
A few studies have modeled metal mixtures measured in multiple
matrices simultaneously and demonstrated that a combination of
different metal biomarker factors may improve the prediction of health
outcomes Rechtman et al Bauer et al Those studies have
validated techniques to select the most important biomarker for each
exposure individually which has provided useful information for rec
ommending a more suitable biomarker for a single metal To our
knowledge very few epidemiological studies have evaluated the overall
performance of simple metal mixtures up to metals measured in
different media in association with health outcomes Levin Schwartz
et al Sanders et al
Therefore our goals were to assess
whether data on a wide panel of metal mixture exposures measured
using different media can be integrated and compare the performance of
different matrices when assessing the relationship between metal mix
tures and birth outcomes
To achieve this goal we conducted the following study First we
proposed ways to integrate multi media exposure information from
biomarkers measured in different media Second we assessed the per
formance of metal mixtures measured in different media and the com
bined multi media exposure as related to health outcomes We chose
adverse birth outcomes as our outcome of interest because exposure to
metals impacts various biological pathways that contribute to adverse
birth outcomes including preterm delivery and low birthweight Kim

Limited mixture studies
on this topic have mostly focused on metals measured in either urine or
blood
Kim et al Signes Pastor et al Govarts et al
Luo et al Lee et al In the Puerto Rico PROTECT study we
measured a wide range of metals in paired urine and blood samples
which enabled us to compare the associations between adverse birth
outcomes and urinary or blood metal mixtures as well as integrated
metal mixtures utilizing both matrices We hypothesized that the use of
urine blood and the integrated metal mixtures would demonstrate
differing performance when modeling adverse birth outcomes inform
ing more efficient study designs for exposure assessment

study visits the average for urine biomarkers was taken of the two
remaining concentrations and the average for blood biomarker was
equal to the single available concentration In the case of two missing
urine measurement the average metal concentration was equal to the
single available concentration After these steps of preprocessing metals
that were measured in paired media have both urinary and blood
geometric average measurements and had at least of samples with
concentrations above the LOD in both matrices were included in sta
tistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all exposures and outcome
variables We applied natural logarithmic transformation to all urinary
and blood metals because the distributions were right skewed prior to
transformation Spearman s rank correlations rs were used for the
analysis of the relationships between paired urinary and blood metal
average concentrations Data were analyzed using R version A

MMB composition
In this analysis we proposed two approaches to integrate exposure
information from urinary and blood metal measurements into a multi
media biomarker MMB In the first approach inspired by the
concept of cue combination in quantitative cognitive neurosciences the
minimum variance unbiased estimator for multiple sources of informa
tion we used an internal reliability indicator of the biomarkers to
integrate MMB unsupervised method In the second approach which is
a supervised method weighted quantile sum WQS models were used
because the relative contribution of the individual biomarkers to the
overall exposure and health outcome association is easier to interpret
than many other mixtures methods The details of the approaches are
described below
Integrating multi media biomarker MMB using intraclass corre
lation coefficient ICC Characterizing the within and between
individual variation of measurements with parameters such as intra
class correlation coefficient ICC gives information on the reliability of
the different media biomarkers ICC is defined as the proportion of the
Wi l

whether a certain medium urine or blood as a biomarker for a
particular metal is a relatively reliable biomarker and C is the geometric
average of metal concentration
Integrating multi media biomarker MMB using weighted quantile
sum regression WQS In addition to the unsupervised learning method
the amount of exposure information each biomarker carries can be
quantified simultaneously based on the relationship of the exposure
measured in a certain medium and health effect a supervised approach
Therefore the second approach for integrating urinary and blood bio
markers was weighted quantile sum regression WQS which models
the body burden of quantiles of exposure WQS estimates a set of
weights such that the linear combinations of the weights quantile
biomarkers have the highest association with the outcome Carrico

are previously described Yorita Christensen et al In our anal
ysis Wi is the unknown weight for the ith medium urine blood
c z represents a vector of adjusted covariates and P is a vector of
regression coefficients for those covariates By placing the constraints of
the weight WD estimates to be non negative and sum to the
comparative values of urine and blood metals to multi media bio
markers and the joint effect can be determined The weights can then be
used to quantify the contribution of each medium to the multi media
biomarker In this supervised learning approach we used WQS
bootstraps to determine the association between each birth outcome
and urinary and blood biomarkers of each metal separately A pre
liminary analysis was conducted before the construction of WQS models
As WQS assumes linearity in an effort to detect potential non linear
relationships between individual metals and birth outcomes we used
generalized additive models GAM to graphically depict the metal and
birth outcome relationship Results from GAM including metal concen
trations as splines and the GAM output graphics showed that when the
smoothing estimator is significant the observed associations are linear
estimated degree of freedom Therefore we proceeded with WQS
All outcomes were regressed on the geometric averages of SG corrected
urinary and blood concentrations across all the available visits Then we

Single pollutant analysis
In epidemiological studies with repeated measurements the ICC
metric ranging from O to indicates reliability among multiple mea
surements of a quantity when close to O ICC reflects large variations
between repeated measures a k a poor ability to distinguish between
individuals with high and low exposure levels when close to the
repeated measures are close to each other which reflects a good ability to
discriminate between individuals with high and low exposure levels In
this unsupervised machine learning approach we utilized the ICCs
calculated from repeated measurements of SG corrected urinary up to
three visits and blood metals up to two visits Ashrap et al as
weighting parameters to construct an integrated MMB separately for
each metal using equations

Mixture analysis
Construction of environmental risk scores ERSs using ridge
regression Environmental Risk Score ERS was proposed as a potential
summary measure for the effects of mixtures in epidemiologic research
Park et al
The concept of ERS is to build a predictive risk model
as a weighted sum of the exposure levels from simultaneous assessment
of the all the pollutants in the mixture Weights are determined by the
magnitudes standardized regression coefficients of the association
between each exposure and the outcome of interest
Park et al
We constructed Environmental Risk Scores ERSs as weighted summary
measures of the effects of metals where the weights were regression
coefficients derived from models of the association between metal
mixtures and the outcome of interest We utilized Ridge regression to
guide the weight of each metal in relation to preterm birth Ridge

commonly used supervised machine learning solutions

our analytic purpose was to evaluate the same full set of metals as

different directions of individual metal birth outcome associations

metal exposure From a risk stratification perspective integration of
urine and blood biomarkers that were derived from both ICC and WQS
approaches improved the model performance in the mixture models
compared to the sole urine or blood biomarker models Although the
confidence intervals for these odds ratio estimates were wider the MMB
integration especially using the WQS approach resulted in substantially
higher effect estimate This finding supports that while multiple mea
surements of the exposure mixture may measure metal body burden
differentially there may still be room for improvement for exposure
measurement error structure and effect estimate when incorporating
urinary and blood biomarker information
Strengths and limitations
Specific strengths of our study include its longitudinal design in
which repeated urinary and blood biomarkers provided more accurate
exposure information during pregnancy This allowed us to quantify the
temporal reliability of the two media measurements ICCs which were
further used as weights to integrate the multi media measure of expo
sure Secondly this study utilized data driven machine learning ap
proaches to inform the composition of multi media metal biomarkers
measured in different media and guide the construction of environ
mental risk scores for each medium reflecting the overall exposure to the
metal mixture Finally this study evaluated the health effects of multiple
metals simultaneously and compared the performance of different
media biomarkers and integrated biomarkers in relation to adverse birth
outcomes in the context of a mixture The results lay the groundwork for
future epidemiological studies on biomarker selection when examining
the mixture effects of metals
However our study has several limitations The relatively small
sample size did not allow cross validation within this population on ERS
which may have caused overfitting of ERS Future studies with a larger
sample size should implement training and test datasets to cross validate
ERSs Studies with larger sample sizes are also needed to address po
tential improvement of models by including non linear terms and in
teractions between metals and covariates that were not accounted for in
the current analysis Depending on the pharmacokinetics of each
chemical within a family mixture studies in general are challenged by
the complications of combining chemical biomarkers where each may
be representing a unique window of exposure While our ERS estimates
also suffered from this limitation by combining multi media exposure
using both urine and blood biomarkers we were able to reduce the
measurement error in the mixture analysis to an extent Because the
average concentrations of metal biomarkers across three visits were used
in this analysis windows of vulnerability during pregnancy were not
evaluated Given that associations between metal mixtures and birth
outcomes may depend on developmental time windows it is important
for future longitudinal studies to evaluate the temporality of the asso
ciations In addition while we evaluated a mixture of essential and
non essential metals it is possible that other metals that were not
assessed in our study affect the performance of urine or blood bio
markers Future work is needed to expand the mixture evaluation to
include more metals and other biospecimens including hair and saliva
as well as other adverse health outcomes because our results may not be
generalizable to other outcomes of interest Finally while the mixture of
metals in this study is representative of exposures experienced by Puerto
Rican populations it may not accurately reflect exposure profiles for
other populations
Conclusions
Our study used innovative methodology to provide new detailed
insights into the individual and integrated associations of urinary and
blood mixture biomarkers of metal exposure with birth outcomes Our
investigation demonstrates within practical metal analytical panels
that measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
Environmental Research
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture The results of our study
elucidate the importance of considering the overall mixture perfor
mance of a certain medium Future studies are needed to expand to
evaluate the performance with different metal panels media health
outcomes of interest and methods to integrate exposure information to
further address how to most effectively study the health impacts of
exposure to mixtures

ABSTRACT
Purpose We examined prospective associations between early childcare precarity or the security and reliability of
childcare arrangements and subsequent maternal health
Study Design We conducted a secondary analysis of survey responses from mothers of children in the Future of
Families and Child Wellbeing study We assessed the following childcare measures insecure childcare insecure
childcare with missed work inadequate childcare and emergency childcare support We used linear and logistic
regression models with robust standard errors to examine associations between these measures when the index child
was age and maternal health outcomes overall health depression and parenting stress later when the child was age
We then examined additive experiences of childcare measures across child ages and on maternal health outcomes
Results Early inadequate childcare increased odds of later poor maternal overall health adjusted odds ratio aOR
confidence interval Cll All early childcare precarity measures increased odds of maternal depression
insecure childcare aOR Cl insecure childcare with missed work aOR CI and
inadequate childcare aOR Cl Emergency childcare support decreased the odds of adverse
maternal health outcomes poor overall health aOR Cl to depression aOR Cl to
and parenting stress B Cl to Prolonged experiences had stronger associations with
maternal health than shorter experiences
Conclusion Early childcare precarity has long term adverse associations with maternal health and emergency childcare
support seems to be favorable for maternal health These findings highlight childcare precarity as a social determinant of
women s health for researchers clinicians and decision makers

Childcare precarity is a state of insecure and unreliable
childcare arrangements while parents are working or in school
Among other hardships faced by families with young children
childcare precarity is unique because it interferes directly with
an adult parent s ability to work or attend school which can lead
to work family conflict long term income instability and
decreased economic opportunities particularly for those who
identify as mothers Geyer Haan Wrohlich Grice et al
Luhr Schneider Harknett Wrohlich
Studies show that women assume the majority of child
care responsibilities Petts Carlson Pepin Thus expe
riences of childcare precarity may take a particular toll on

Understanding the potential
health consequences of the closely adjoining maternal experi
ence of childcare precarity or conversely maternal access to
emergency childcare support from family or friends would
inform strategies to improve women s health and well being
As reflected in ongoing policy debates about parental leave
Goodman Williams Dow and universal access to pre
kindergarten education Reid et al childcare needs are
greatest before school entry at age Problems with childcare
arrangements in the preschool years after infancy but before
school entry have been associated with immediate psycho
logical strain parenting stress and depressive symptoms which
may be causal or explained by other family instability variables
during this period of transitional parenthood when those who
identify as mothers may experience conflict from competing
responsibilities Charrois et al Johnson Padilla
et al Pilarz Hill Whether or not childcare
experiences have lasting associations with maternal health even
after the peak period of childcare needs has passed for
example when children are in school is poorly understood
Furthermore existing research does not report whether the kind
of dose response association that exists for other hardships e g
the severity of food insecurity corresponds with the severity of
negative health outcomes also exists for childcare precarity
Gross Mendelsohn Messito Reid
To address these gaps we use data from a national birth
cohort recruited from large cities to investigate prospective as
sociations between early maternal childcare experiences inse
cure childcare insecure childcare with missed work inadequate
childcare availability of emergency childcare before school en
try when children were age and later maternal health out
comes when children were age overall health status
depression and parenting stress We hypothesized that
increased childcare precarity risk is adversely associated with
later maternal health outcomes access to emergency child
care support is positively associated with maternal health out
comes and prolonged experiences of childcare precarity are
more strongly associated with long term maternal health out
comes than shorter experiences
Methods
Study Design
This was a secondary analysis of data from the Future of
Families and Child Wellbeing FFCWB study an ongoing na
tional birth cohort study from large U S cities
Reichman et al Leveraging a longitudinal cohort dataset
as has been done with similar research questions Anyigbo
Jimenez Sosnowski Dauner Wilmot Schultz
we account for temporal ordering by measuring childcare pre
carity at a developmentally appropriate earlier time point before
subsequent maternal health outcomes of interest Specifically to
test the hypothesis of whether childcare precarity experiences
when children were age have associations with maternal
health outcomes when children are age a lag of approximately
years we estimated regression models with conservative
robust standard errors In these models we adjusted for relevant
covariates selected using a comprehensive directed acyclic graph
informed by important baseline covariates related to the FFCWB
sampling design as well as a careful review of childcare studies

The FFCWB study oversampled nonmarital births a
population at increased risk to be at a lower socioeconomic
status and with decreased access to social support Liang Berger
Brand Solomon Fears The original cohort study
included children largely from socioeconomically disad
vantaged groups Study staff interviewed parents shortly after
giving birth baseline then re interviewed parents when chil
dren were and years old Our secondary analysis included
self identified mothers who were primary caregivers for the
focal child with complete longitudinal data for our variables

Measures
Childcare Precarity Measures When the Child Was Age
To conceptualize our main predictor we first referenced prior
work examining childcare instability which describes child
health outcomes associated with unstable fluctuating or mul
tiple childcare arrangements Our interest was in capturing the
adjoining but distinct maternal experience of childcare pre
carity or feelings of uncertainty lack of predictability and
insecurity a concept informed by an interdisciplinary review of
literature describing similar experiences of job and economic
precarity
Luhr et al North Parolin Lee We
used three assessments of childcare precarity with increasing
severity measured when children were at age These questions
were only asked of parents of children in regular childcare
defined in the FFCWB study as being cared for by someone other
than a mother or father on a regular basis for or more hours a
week
Insecure childcare This question captures childcare that fell
through leaving the participant to scramble for backup childcare
arrangements The survey asked Approximately how many
times in the past month did you have to make special arrange
ments because your usual childcare arrangement fell through
Participants who reported this experience at least once were
coded as having insecure childcare The FFCWB did not collect
information on the circumstances for which childcare fell
through such as a parent s subjective decision to keep a child
home owing to
unreliability

participant missing a day of work or training The survey asked
How many times in the past month did you miss work or school
because your childcare arrangement fell through Participants
who reported this experience at least once were coded as having
insecure childcare with missed work
Inadequate childcare This question captures the highest level of
childcare severity assessing whether or not childcare precarity
resulted in interruption or suspension of the participant s pro
fessional trajectory The survey asked participants whether since
their child was age Have you had to quit a job school or
training activity because you had problems arranging childcare
or keeping a childcare arrangement Participants who respon
ded yes were coded as having had inadequate childcare
Access to Emergency Childcare Support When the Child Was
Years Old
To assess emergency childcare support we used a question
that captures access to emergency childcare support from
informal sources If you needed help during the next year could
you count on someone to help you with emergency child care
If the participant replied yes they were coded as having emer
gency childcare support This question asked of all participants
regardless of whether the child was in childcare is part of a
larger question set in the FFCWB measuring perceived social
support e g someone to count on for a loan which has
been consistently associated with positive health outcomes
Dauner et al Delaney
Reliable childcare is most relevant for parents who are
working or in school but emergency childcare support has been
shown to be a key component of a parental safety net Harknett
Knab Harknett Hartnett Thus when examining
associations with maternal health outcomes when children were
age we assessed emergency childcare support in all families as
well as in a subset of participants who ever worked when their
children were ages or Given that access to emergency
childcare support could mitigate childcare precarity we also
explored whether emergency childcare support had a buffering
interaction with childcare precarity i e whether it reduced the
magnitude of association between childcare precarity and
maternal health
Maternal Health Measures When the Child Was Age
Poor Fair Overall Maternal Health
This measure captures self reported health which studies
have established to be a valid health status indicator for adult
population health monitoring to reflect physical health health
care use and mortality McGee et al Miilunpalo et al
The survey asked In general how is your health Par
ticipants could respond excellent very good good fair
or poor Per prior work McGee et al Miilunpalo et al
we dichotomized overall health at the cutpoint of poor
fair versus all others and ran sensitivity analyses using a cutpoint
of excellent versus all others This same measure was also
assessed in participants when children were age which we
used as a covariate in certain models
Maternal Depression
Maternal depression was derived from the Composite Inter
national Diagnostic Interview a comprehensive fully structured
interview assessing International Classification of Diseases
edition and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
IVth edition mental health criteria administered by trained in
terviewers Kessler et al The FFCWB uses the short form
which includes Composite International Diagnostic Interview
questions about the prior months Examples of symptoms
surveyed include losing interest weight changes trouble
sleeping or concentrating feeling worthless and thinking about
death The FFCWB user guide Fragile families and child wellbeing
study n d recommends two scoring methods based on symp
tom duration For our main analyses we used the liberal
scoring which is more sensitive for depression score
positive for depression with this scoring and we conducted
sensitivity analyses using conservative scoring which is more
specific score positive for depression with this scoring
Fragile families and child wellbeing study n d
Maternal
depression was also assessed when children were age and we
used the short form scoring as a covariate in certain models
Maternal Parenting Stress
This measure captures stress triggered by child rearing tasks
FFCWB used questions derived from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics and the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training
Program Survey McGonagle et al Participants responded
on a point Likert scale e g not at all true completely true
to statements such as Being a parent is harder than I thought it
would be or I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent In
line with prior work we reverse coded the items and summed
the items so that higher scores represented higher levels of
agreement with parenting stress statements Cooper et al
We ran sensitivity analyses using the alter

from each statement Fragile families and child wellbeing study

stress when children were age which was assessed with the
same measure but not collected for two of the FFCWB cities at
that time point
Covariates
We tested all factors for multicollinearity by assessing vari
ance inflation factors before inclusion in our model Maternal
baseline characteristics measured at birth included maternal
age years race and ethnicity non Hispanic white non
Hispanic Black Hispanic other education level less than high
school high school graduate some college college graduate
family structure married cohabiting parents in a relationship
but not cohabiting no relationship and income as a percentage
of the federal poverty level
or higher Child baseline characteristics included
assigned sex at birth first born and multiple birth status
Covariates at other timepoints included whether participants
ever worked or were in school when their children were age or
before age yes no Prior work has also shown that the use of
childcare centers over individual caregivers led to work absences
owing to child illnesses so we adjusted for childcare center use
as well the number of childcare arrangements concurrently used
when their children were at age to proxy for childcare insta
bility
Gordon et al
As per prior relevant research we controlled for child
temperament at age using the mean of the Emotionality Ac
tivity and Sociability Temperament Survey
Pilarz Hill
with higher scores indicating negative emotionality and shyness
This covariate helped to account for child level time invariant
differences that may contribute to both childcare precarity ex
periences and maternal health
Finally as has been done in prior work Hedges et al
we ran an additional model that adjusted for the corresponding
maternal health outcome measure when their children were age
before age childcare exposures to account for time invariant
maternal health characteristics at baseline in an effort to isolate
our estimates to what occurred when their children were be
tween ages and only
Statistical Analysis
We used Stata SE version Stata Corp College Station TX
to conduct all analyses To preserve sample size we did not use
FFCWB weights so that we could include all families with com
plete longitudinal data
We first summarized child maternal and childcare charac
teristics Using unadjusted or independent sample t tests as
appropriate we tested for statistically significant differences
between the sample in and not in regular childcare For our
primary study question we used logistic and linear regressions
as appropriate to estimate adjusted regression models of asso
ciations between childcare precarity when children were age
and maternal health outcomes when children were age Model
controlled for maternal child and childcare characteristics
Model added the corresponding maternal health outcome
measure when children were age before age childcare ex
posures We used robust standard errors to account conserva
tively for potential bias in estimates We presented estimates as
odds ratios ORS or unstandardized linear regression co
efficients Bs with confidence intervals CIS
To characterize persistent childcare precarity or support across
child ages and we categorized the variables as never no at
both ages and the reference group age only yes at age no
at age age only no at age yes at age and both time points
yes at both ages and and estimated adjusted logistic and
linear regression models to examine associations between
persistent early childcare precarity or emergency childcare sup
port and maternal health outcomes when children were age We
ran these analyses using covariates from model to maximizes
cases given that the corresponding parenting stress variable was
not measured in all cities when children were age and we ran
sensitivity analyses using covariates from model
To assess cross sectional relationships when children were
age we conducted supplemental analyses examining associa
tions between childcare measures and maternal health out
comes both measured when children were age We also
examined associations between childcare measures when chil
dren were age and maternal health outcomes when children
were age Supplemental analyses used model covariates
Results
The overall sample included participants of those
participants had children in regular childcare

ground almost one half self identified as Black almost
one quarter as Hispanic and less than one quarter
as white There were subgroup differences across socio
demographics between those whose children were in and not in
regular childcare Participants with children in regular childcare
were more likely to be Black vs less likely to be
Hispanic vs and more likely to have higher levels of
education and income This group was also more likely to not live
with a partner i e less likely to be married vs less
likely to be cohabiting vs

Discussion
In a national U S birth cohort from large cities we found
significant and robust associations between early childcare pre
carity and maternal health outcomes approximately years later
which have not been described before These findings suggest
that policies to increase access to reliable secure childcare and
emergency childcare supports could improve the health of
mothers of young children We categorized levels of childcare
precarity i e insecure insecure with missed work inadequate
as often is done for food insecurity e g food insecure food
insecure with hunger Blumberg et al This categoriza
tion which acknowledges that families experience varying levels
of hardship also demonstrates that increased severity may be
associated with poorer health outcomes and indicates that
childcare precarity is a social determinant of women s health
Our finding that early inadequate childcare was associated
with increased odds of poor fair maternal health later on extends
literature showing associations between other experiences of
social determinants of health and poorer overall health e g food
insecurity

access to emergency childcare support had protective and ad
ditive effects on overall health later on participants with
emergency childcare support when children were both ages
and had one half the odds of poor fair health compared with
participants who had no emergency childcare support when
children were either age To our knowledge this is one of the first
studies to find associations between childcare experiences with
long term overall maternal health and it suggests future studies
should elucidate potential pathways from experiencing childcare
precarity to potentially curtailing work or training reducing in
come increasing stress and compromising overall women s
health Chatterji Markowitz Brooks Gunn
All childcare precarity measures we considered were associ
ated with subsequent maternal depression Maternal depression
is a common chronic source of disability that is also likely a
vehicle for the intergenerational transmission of poverty related
toxic stress Letourneau et al Schor Wachs Black
A prior study found associations between percep
Engle
tions of stable childcare access and decreased odds of maternal
depression when children were preschool aged but not between
an increased number of childcare arrangements and concurrent
maternal depression
Johnson Padilla Our findings
reinforce that it is the participant s experiences of childcare
precarity rather than the actual arrangement which may reflect
maternal cultural and personal preferences that likely
contribute to maternal depression Our findings also suggest that
the most notable associations with childcare precarity may be
long term in the setting of persistent experiences of managing
conflicts between work and family Supplemental analyses
showed that experiences of inadequate childcare starting when
children were age were associated with maternal depression
when children were age showing potentially enduring effects
of childcare precarity on maternal mental health Future studies
should elucidate vulnerable stages of parenthood when systemic
efforts to deliver childcare support may optimize long term
maternal mental health
Although depression captures overall feelings of dysphoria or
anhedonia parenting stress stems specifically from parenting
e g l feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent Although
we found strong associations between early childcare precarity
and later maternal depression associations with parenting stress
were less consistent Early insecure and inadequate childcare but
not insecure childcare with missed work had associations with
parenting stress scores none of these estimates were significant
after adjusting for parenting stress at year Our measure of
parenting stress was not available for two of the FFCWB cities
when children were age which potentially limited our ability to
detect associations in those models However this finding is
consistent with prior research showing that associations be
tween childcare precarity and parenting stress do not hold up
when adjusting for prior stress perhaps because participants
experiencing stress to begin with are also more likely to expe
rience childcare precarity
In supplemental
Pilarz Hill
analyses we found that all experiences of childcare precarity
were associated with parenting stress concurrently when chil
dren were age which may indicate that parenting stress may
dissipate over time as concentrated childcare needs decrease
The ability to follow families more intensely and reevaluate
childcare supports at various stages may yield valuable infor
mation on the extent of childcare supports needed across
childhood informing interventions to optimize family health
We found that emergency childcare support had favorable
associations with all subsequent maternal health outcomes in
the full sample These findings reinforce an accumulating body of
evidence showing that access to social support is a matter of
public health
Participants parenting on their
Balaji et al
own who made up the majority of our sample may also
particularly benefit from robust social support networks How
ever as reflected in the regular childcare sample where associ
ations were similar in direction and magnitude but no longer
significant access to emergency childcare may be helpful as a
short term solution but not an adequate substitute for ongoing
reliable childcare essential for a parent to successfully engage in
employment or training The sample who ever worked when
children were ages and the vast majority did show
benefits from emergency childcare support suggesting that the
presence of this informal safety net does likely benefit most
participants who are attempting to work or go to school We did
not detect statistical interaction when exploring whether
emergency childcare support buffered the effects of childcare
precarity However future studies should consider intentionally
powering their samples to examine additional subgroup ana
lyses by income race or types of social support specifically as a
strength based approach
Limitations include study design sampling unmeasured
variable bias and loss to follow up The FFCWB is a prospective
observational study and causality cannot be established The
FFCWB also oversampled nonmarital births with the intention of
generating data on an understudied socioeconomically disad
vantaged population Yet childcare precarity likely has health
impacts across socioeconomic strata as highlighted in parenting
studies during the COVID pandemic Petts et al In
analyses examining childcare experiences across timepoints
when children were ages and a few of the subgroups were
below participants and estimates were less precise with large
CIS These analyses were likely underpowered to detect associ
ations for mothers experiencing precarity consistently when
their children were ages and In light of limited U S data
available to study long term outcomes of childcare precarity
new prospective studies involving larger and more diverse co
horts are needed FFCWB also only asks about childcare precarity
for children regularly cared for by someone else at the time of the
survey omitting participants who may have used regular care in
early childhood but not at the time of the survey Although we
were able to examine the effects of emergency childcare support
on all participants experiences of childcare precarity were only
assessed in participants who had children in regular childcare at
the time The FFCWB also did not include information on why
childcare fell through which may depend on subjective parental
judgment e g mild illnesses rather than provider reliability
However our decision to control for childcare type or child
temperament may have tempered this potential bias Finally loss
to follow up is also a limitation although our overall sample
characteristics are similar to the FFCWB baseline suggesting
minimal bias owing to attrition
Implications for Policy and or Practice
Overall our study findings leverage a life course framework to
suggest that experiences of early childcare precarity may be
followed by persistent or even mounting adverse maternal
health associations over time Findings from this study support
primary care efforts to screen for childcare precarity Chung
et al Sokol et al as well as integration of
maternal child health care system linkages to harmonize access
to child and maternal community and health resources

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective We sought to understand BRCA previvors perceptions of communication with genetic counselors and other
healthcare providers
Methods We conducted qualitative interviews and utilized thematic analysis to develop patterns present in the nar
ratives of previvors
Results Interviews with previvors suggest genetic counselors and other providers often make assumptions about
previvors family planning and treatrnent needs based on perceived gender age and sexual orientation
Conclusioru BRCA patients require individualized attention when planning for their future and making healthcare de
cisions and we argue that implementing patient centered care practices into the communication process can provide a
higher quality of care
Innovatioru This study offers an innovative lens through which scholars and healthcare providers may examine the ex
periences of BRCA previvors as they seek adequate care Asking previvors to explain their perceptions of conversations
with genetic counselors and healthcare providers offers insight into the communicative process of seeking care rather
than the health outcomes of the care itself Our findings suggest biases among providers related to gender age and
sexual orientation are concerning elements of family planning communication that potentially interrupt previvors
abilities to express their care needs in a safe environment We argue for an increased awareness of and advocacy
for more inclusive conversations regarding treatrnent and family planning decisions
Individuals found to carry a pathogenic variant in the genes BRCAI
sometimes referred to as previvors often meet with numerous healthcare
providers including genetic counselors gynecologists and oncologists
throughout their journey They rely on these and other sources to learn
more about their genetic mutation family planning and fertility options
and treatment possibilities which largely include surveillance and surgery
Research on communication between genetic counselors and BRCA previvors
is growing yet still provides opportunities for exploration A much larger
body of research has explored the communication between genetic coun
selors and individuals who have received a cancer diagnosis or are receiving
treatments including a scoping review published in highlighting
the need to study the communication process in genetic counseling more
deeply Prior literature suggests genetic counseling tends to focus on biomed
ical information rather than psychological support of patients In addition
patients needs for personalized information regarding their diagnosis family
dynamics and treatment options may not always be met by genetic

counselors In a study of breast and ovarian cancer patients Jacobs and
colleagues argued that research is needed to better understand communi
cation by oncology professionals including genetic counselors
We begin to answer this call and extend agency to previvors with an
exploratory study investigating BRCA previvors and their experiences
with genetic counselors and other members of their healthcare team
BRCA previvors along with most precision medicine patients have specific
needs when meeting with genetic counselors and other providers Sharing
previvors experiences with healthcare providers like genetic counselors
gynecologists and oncologists through qualitative interviews such as
those used in this study can help educate scholars healthcare providers
genetic counselors and professionals and policymakers on how to improve
engagement with this growing population

BRCA previvors including an increased focus on patient centered care and
communication Patient centered care is designed to manage the con
cerns many scholars have noted are central to the previvor experience like
uncertainty information exchange emotional well being and self
management In a recent article on enhancing patient centered
care within precision oncology Chou and her colleagues note commu
nication is critical for those being genetically tested for hereditary breast
and ovarian cancer Such patients are often struggling with feelings of un
certainty in understanding their diagnosis and in making decisions
based on their results Genetic counselors and other providers can help pa
tients manage their uncertainty by addressing their specific care prefer
ences as well as concerns like financial insecurity misinformation and
the possibility of changing treatment modalities when necessary
There are documented psychological impacts of genetic testing for BRCA
patients and patient centered care and communication is critical
to ensure previvors needs are met
In a qualitative study of BRCA previvors experiences with genetic test
ing and treatment planning Hesse Biber found previvors did not make
decisions specifically based on statistical data provided by their genetic
counselor Instead they filtered those data through a broader lens of per
sonal experiences and preferences Genetic counselors must understand
those personal preferences to offer the highest quality of care for previvors
Patient centered care within precision medicine and genetic testing as de
scribed by Arora and colleagues needs to take a whole person approach
rather than focusing on the patient s genes alone
While important most prior scholarship has analyzed quantitative com
munication outcomes such as patients uncertainty anxiety and stress after
communicating with counselors rather than the communication process it
self Qualitative studies are needed to analyze perceptions of the process
of communication in visits between BRCA previvors genetic counselors
and other providers on their healthcare teams to ensure the highest quality
care throughout the previvor journey that is meeting the needs of previvors
Family planning for BRCA previvors
Precision medicine and genetic testing for BRCA previvors has many
benefits but requires strong communication between patients and providers
particularly around patients personal and family planning needs Fam
ily planning is the act of deciding how many children to have and how to
space out pregnancy keeping in mind fertility issues contraception prena
tal testing and other health concerns Family planning is a central topic
within genetic counseling sessions for BRCA patients as decisions about
managing cancer risk i e prophylactic oophorectomy might also impact
reproductive decisions However family planning communication
scholarship is still quite limited with regards to navigating the individual
preferences of patients Most literature notes the importance of family plan
ning as well as the struggle many go through in the process of making deci
sions regarding their reproductive health but research detailing
the process of how patients and genetic counselors communicate about
family planning is scarce
There is often an assumption that BRCA previvors want to get married
have kids and plan for a family once diagnosed However a recent study of
single unmarried Korean BRCA mutation carriers found that of
those surveyed no longer wanted to get married and who previously
wanted to bear children no longer want them Family planning schol
arship is often presented through a normative cisgender and heterosexual
lens leaving out others experiencing previvorship Additionally there is
minimal research on how the age of BRCA previvors impacts their family
planning and treatment choices These previvors may not interact
with genetic counselors in the same way as others and research is needed
to detail the experiences of those patients so counselors and other
healthcare providers understand the specific needs of all patients
Therefore this study asks

What were previvors perceptions of communication with providers

Method
Study design
To examine BRCA previvors experiences with genetic counselors and
other healthcare professionals throughout their process of diagnosis sur
gery and recovery we used an exploratory qualitative interview approach
The data were collected as part of a larger study that examined reasons for
social media content creation by previvors although these data were not
previously analyzed The Institutional Review Board approved the study
protocol
Recruitment and eligibility
This study recruited individuals living in the United States who have
been found to carry a BRCAI or mutation and identify as woman
with the pronouns she her or a non binary person with the pronouns
they them Of the total participants n were women and one
was non binary However the non binary individual noted that they are
often perceived as female and have woman listed as their gender on
their medical paperwork for insurance purposes All participants were
white presenting but two identified as Hispanic and two identified as Ash
kenazi Jewish noting the importance of their ethnicity as related to their
BRCA status as one in Ashkenazi Jewish women have a BRCA mutation
All individuals had to be over the age of and could participate re
gardless of where they were in their BRCA journey Additionally all partic
ipants must have been active on at least one personal social media account
where they shared about their experiences publicly
Individuals were recruited through both Instagram and TikTok The
principal investigator searched popular hashtags related to BRCA includ
ing brca brcal previvor brcagene and breastcancerprevivor
Once accounts populated the researcher reached out to previvors who
listed their email addresses publicly on their social media accounts
explaining the project and requesting they respond if interested Once indi
viduals responded they were scheduled for interviews and provided with
the consent form
Procedure
Eligible participants were scheduled for a virtual interview over Zoom
Verbal consent was requested again at the start of each interview before re
cording was initiated All interview audio was recorded for accuracy and
transparency for the duration of the interview The interviews were based
on a semi structured interview format and topics included the previvor s ex
perience with BRCA up until the day of the interview their experience
working with genetic counselors and healthcare providers through their
journey their activity on social media and how they feel about the online
communities surrounding BRCA Each of the interviews lasted between
and min and sessions were transcribed verbatim by a professional tran
scription company Participants received compensation in the form of a
gift card
Analysis
Thematic analysis was implemented by the principal investiga
tor and supported by a graduate assistant GA This method was recently
applied to the study of BRCA previvorship as a label of identity and
to explore how previvors share about their experiences on Instagram
The transcripts were manually coded by the principal investigator and the
GA for patterns related to previvor s experiences with healthcare profes
sionals including genetic counselors We elected to follow the two stage re
view process recommended to maintain the rigor of the method including
an initial round of open coding followed by a discussion of the primary

Family planning conversations are designed not only to help BRCA
previvors decide when to have kids but also whether they want kids at
all As BRCA previvors can be diagnosed quite early in life some say they
were frustrated while interacting with their care team For example one
young participant noted that she didn t like how the conversation was cen
tered around building a family versus being alive I m thinking more about
the fact that regardless of having a family if I don t do these things I m not
going to be here for my family So that s really what s more important to
me is me being here versus the family I m creating Another par
ticipant agreed saying It was extremely frustrating for me especially
as a year old with no clear plans to get married or have kids It re
ally it was almost like it felt like fearmongering now that I m out of it
Discussion and conclusion
Discussion
This study found that while genetic counselors and other providers of
fered valuable information to patients previvors felt unprepared emotion
ally to take on their diagnosis and unsure of whether they would receive
a high quality of care They believed genetic counselors and providers
gave incomplete information that left them confused and afraid of what
was to come Providers also made assumptions about previvors identity
and family planning based on perceived gender sexual orientation
and age
In response to RQI we found most previvors perceived their communi
cation with genetic counselors to be positive overall especially when
previvors took the time to advocate for themselves as a patient However
specific interactions were perceived as negative by previvors throughout
their office visit experiences Feelings of frustration and distress occurred
throughout the previvor experience as suggested in a similar study
from meeting with genetic counselors to receiving treaunent Our study
found that even those tangential to the medical intervention process such
as front desk staff at medical offices and hospitals impact the experiences
of previvors
In response to previvors said they felt pushed toward assimilating
with societal norms in appointments with genetic counselors and other pro
viders The tendency for genetic counselors to assume a patient s identity
and life goals based on their perceived gender sexual orientation and
age can be harmful for BRCA patients putting them in a position where
they may be encouraged to disclose personal and private information to
correct the assumptions of the genetic counselor BRCA patients need care
that is personalized to them to reduce the possibility of psychological
harm Currently there is a lack of research on identity
inclusive language and conversation tactics for providers to implement
when discussing treatment and family planning options with BRCA
patients A recent case study reviewed an experience treating a young
trans feminine BRCA patient Even as a child under with BRCA
the genetic counselor and healthcare providers respected the patient s au
tonomy and identity by including them in all decisions listening to their
perspective and committing to the obligation of clinicians to do no
harm This case demonstrates how ethical principles and implementing
patient centered care can be used to help guide providers and manage un
certainty for BRCA patients related to their identity and more research is
needed to craft proper guidelines around working with BRCA patients in
this capacity
Practicing patient centered care would also encourage counselors to ask
about family planning rather than making assumptions about patients pref
erences and values Recent studies have argued providers require more ef
fective education regarding specific subgroups and their needs When
genetic counselors meet with a feminine presenting patient they may as
sume pronouns sexual orientation and the desire of their patient to have
PEC Innovation
children Pre screening BRCA patients with surveys about pronouns
and identity and communicating with the patient in an initial meeting
about their life plans might mitigate assumptions For younger BRCA pa
tients meeting with genetic counselors psychosocial needs are an impor
tant focus when meeting with genetic counselors and family planning In
a previous study young BRCA patients noted psychosocial distress as a fac
tor of family planning much more frequently than was recognized by ge
netic counselors and as BRCA patients receive diagnoses earlier in
life providers must consider how their age may impact their treatment
and family planning decisions Finally patient centered care not only per
tains to the specific provider a patient is seeing but must be threaded
through a patient s entire experience with the healthcare system Under
standing that each BRCA previvor is an individual with specific needs for
personalized care will only serve to support that patient in their previvor
journey
While strengths of this study include giving voice to BRCA previvors
and their experiences there were some limitations First the interviews
were conducted over Zoom due to COVID limitations and geographical
distance between the researchers and participants limiting the
interviewer s ability to fully connect with the participant Video interviews
limit the interviewer s ability to respond to body language and utilize the
participant s physical response to questioning as a guide for future ques
tions Additionally the differences in geographic location of each partici
pant may be a limitation considering the access to healthcare varies
widely across the United States Second participants were recruited
through Instagram and TikTok keeping in line with the larger study objec
tives The algorithm present on both platforms most likely pushed the most
popular BRCA previvor accounts to the surface leaving out valuable partic
ipants with smaller follower counts This also meant most participants were
white or white passing This mirrors similar studies which found very little
social media content created by and for Black previvors and other previvors
of color We recognize the limitations of this study as the inclusion
criteria was specific to the larger project and thus overlooked previvors ex
periences with healthcare providers who do not share about their journey
on social media Future studies should explore these community members
perceptions of communication with genetic counselors and other
healthcare providers
Innovation
This study offers an innovative lens through which scholars and
healthcare providers may examine the experiences of BRCA previvors as
they seek adequate care By examining the communicative process of seek
ing BRCA care rather than the health outcomes of the care itself we provide
an innovative approach to investigate previvors perceptions of communi
cation with genetic counselors and other members of their healthcare
team This study increases knowledge around the communication processes
of previvors and gives them agency by allowing them to openly share their
personal experiences Specifically our findings suggest biases among pro
viders related to gender age and sexual orientation are concerning ele
ments of family planning communication that potentially interrupt
previvors abilities to express their care needs in a safe environment We
argue for an increased awareness of and advocacy for more inclusive con
versations regarding treatment and family planning decisions This study
also informs the actors we ve noted throughout the study including genetic
counselors other healthcare providers and policymakers Scholars should
continue to conduct studies that explore the relationship between BRCA
previvors and providers to ensure previvors are receiving inclusive commu
nication surrounding family planning and treatrnent options
Conclusion
This article provides an innovative look at BRCA previvors perceptions
of communication with genetic counselors and other healthcare providers
Interviews with previvors suggest genetic counselors and healthcare team
members often make assumptions about previvors family planning and

assumptions surrounding treatrnent options and family planning

Analyzing the Effect of Prenatal Care
on Pregnancy Outcome
A Conditional Approach
Michael H Malloy MD MS Tzu Cheg Kao PhD and Y J Lee PhD
ABSTRACT
Am Health
InfrMuction
Vital statistics data is a readily avail
able source of information on prenatal
care usage in the United States How to
examine vital statistics and other types of
data for the effect of prenatal care on preg
nan outcome has generated a number of
different methodologies One of the dif
ficulties encountered in using such data
has been the problem of overcoming the
preterm bias effect The preterm bias ef
fect is associated with observing better
outcomes in women who receive prenatal
care than in women who receive no care
This artifact occurs because women re
ceiving no care may deliver prematurely
and may not have an opportunity to enroll
in prenatal care By conditioning the ef
fect of the age of entry into prenatal care
on the gestational age of delivery how
ever the preterm bias effect can be
avoided Nonetheless other problems en
countered in vital statistics data may in
validate the results of the conditional ap
proach
In this study we demonstrate the ef
fect that the possible misclassification of
gestational age in vital statistics data has
on the interpretation of the conditional ap
proach and discuss the problematic nature
of the evaluation of prenatal care
The data for this analysis were ob
tained from linked birth and death certif
icates from Missouri for through
The variables used in the analysis
were the gestational age at which prenatal
care was initiated self report and limited
to the first weeks of pregnancy the

records that involved gestational ages of
greater than weeks and less than

were used for the unad
justed analyses and were
used for the adjusted analyses
The association of the gestational age
of entry into prenatal care with pregnancy
outcome was examined relative to the ges
tational age of delivery Outcomes still
births or infant deaths are presented as

for the better outcome of the early en

may reflect as much on the healthy behav

does on any effect of prenatal care
The evaluation of prenatal care is a
complex problem The incorrect assign

cantly the results of any perinatal analysis
and continues to be a major problem for
which no solution is readily available As
a result there is no ideal model available
to assess the association between prenatal
care and pregnancy outcome Because of
the substantial problems associated with
observational data the use of randomized

The safety of Home Birth The Farm
Study
A Mark Durand MI MPH
Despite a sizable body of literature on
the subject the authors of two recent re
views have concluded that a final judg
ment regarding the relative safety of home
birth still cannot be made
This study compares the outcomes of
a cohort of planned lay midwife
attended home births from the Farm mid
wifery service in rural Tennessee with the
outcomes of a sample of physician at
tended hospital births derived from the
US National Natality Fetal
Mortality Survey NNS NFMS This is
the largest comparative study of a cohort
of home births yet published
Previous studies of home birth safety
underscore the importance of having ex
plicit comparison groups rather than of
being strictly of considering
planned and unplanned home births
separately of tracking intrapartum hos
pital transfers of intended home births
and attributing the outcome to the home
birth group and of controlling for the
effects of birth weight type of delivery
attendant and demogaphic characteris
tics of the mother All these issues have
been addressed in this study
Standards of prenatal care at the
Farm are modeled to the recommenda
tions of the Arnerican College of Obste
tricians and Gynecologists Deliveries are
conducted without analgesia however
and great emphasis is placed on meeting
the emotional needs of the family Several
family members and friends are com
monly in attendance and are encouraged
to take an active role in the birth In
addition the laboring woman is encour
aged to stay off her back and remain phys
ically mobile through labor and delivery
In the absence of signs of fetal distress
women are permitted to labor beyond
hours occasionally for to days They
are also encouraged to eat and drink dur
ing labor in the belief that this allays ma
ternal and the need for opera
tive delivery

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Lead mercury cadmium and arsenic are some of the most common toxic metals to which
Canadians are exposed The effect of exposure to current low levels of toxic metals on fetal growth
restriction is unknown
Objective The aim of this study was to examine relationships between exposure to lead mercury
cadmium and arsenic during pregnancy and risk of small for gestational age SGA birth
Methods Lead mercury cadmium and arsenic levels were measured in blood samples from the first
and third trimesters in pregnant women from across Canada Arsenic species in first trimester urine
were also assessed Relative risks and confidence intervals were estimated using log binomial
multivariate regression Important covariates including maternal age parity pre pregnancy BMI and
smoking were considered in the analysis An exploratory analysis was performed to examine potential
effect modification of these relationships by single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in GSTPI and
GSTOI genes
Results No association was found between blood lead cadmium or arsenic and risk for SGA We ob
served an increased risk for SGA for the highest compared to the lowest tertile of exposure for mercury
gg L RR CI and arsenobetaine gg L RR CI
after adjustment for the effects of parity and smoking A statistically significant interaction was observed
in the relationship between dimethylarsinic acid DMA levels in urinary arsenic and SGA between strata
of GSTOI p for interaction A marginally significant interaction was observed in the re
lationship between blood lead and SGA between strata of GSTPI p for interaction O
Conclusions These results suggest a small increase in risk for SGA in infants born to women exposed to
mercury and arsenic Given the conflicting evidence in the literature this warrants further investigation
in other pregnant populations

Pregnant women and their fetuses are especially susceptible to
the effects of exposure to a variety of environmental toxicants
including lead mercury cadmium and arsenic
Metals are ubiquitous in the environment and exposure occurs
through ingestion of food water soil or dust inhalation from air

guidelines exist for metals e g methylmercury Legrand et al
with more research needed on potential health effects if
any of exposure to the low levels of metals to which most of the
general Canadian populations are exposed
Physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy can alter
toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of environmental chemicals
such as metals in the pregnant woman s body For example bone
resorption to help meet calcium demands can increase during
pregnancy Kovacs and Kronenberg and release cumulative
lead stores from bone into circulation resulting in an endogenous
source of prenatal exposure Gulson et al Manton et al

Rojo et al Increased maternal plasma volume
body fat and body water coupled with increased excretion are
designed for optimal nutrient supply and waste removal from the
fetus Mattison et al However little is known about the
impact of these changes on metabolism and excretion of these
substances during pregnancy and lactation but they likely will
differ depending on the chemical class or nature of the substance
Pregnancy is a period of dynamic growth and change for the de
veloping embryo and fetus thus any insults to the in utero en
vironment could result in suboptimal fetal development Rice and

Children who are born SGA are more likely to have birth compli

ovascular disease and insulin resistance syndrome later in life
Clayton et al Metals are potential risk factors for SGA
births and are hypothesized to induce growth restriction through
oxidative stress mediated pathways Myatt Specifically
when toxic metals are present in the maternal bloodstream they
may cause abnormal placental function and impair nutrient
transport to the fetus through the indirect formation of reactive
oxygen species ROS and reactive nitrogen species RNS that
cause oxidative stress by reacting with macromolecules and da
maging them When the vascular endothelium is damaged en
dothelins are released causing the smooth muscle around the
blood vessels to contract This vasoconstriction causes maternal
blood pressure to increase and decreases the blood flow to the
fetus Pollock and Pollock This reduced blood flow may
cause ischemic damage which could lead to fetal growth restric
tion and subsequent low birthweight Llanos and Ronco

generally accepted as the most reliable indicator of recent arsenic
exposure given that arsenic absorbed from the lungs or the gas

Cd gg L total Hg gg L As gg L The limit of
detection for all arsenic metabolites in urine was gg ASIL
Results below the limit of detection LOD were assigned a value of

Mora et al Blood metal concentrations were based on the
average of the first and third trimester measures if both were
available If only one measure was available then that measure
was used To account for variation in urine dilution due to dis
parity in sampling temperature physical activity and fluid intake
Suwazono et al specific gravity was included as a cov
ariate in the regression model

a role in arsenic biotransformation More specifically GSTOI has
been shown to catalyse the reduction of monomethylarsonic

arsenic exposure and SGA The GSTOI SNP has been shown
to affect the functional activity of the enzyme Punia et al
Double stranded DNA concentration was assessed using the
Quant it PicoGreen assay Invitrogen Briefly PicoGreen dye was
added to each well Following this the fluorescent signal of the
sample was measured and plotted against the standard DNA
concentration used to make a standard curve
Birth outcomes
As part of the MIREC study each baby s length cm and weight
g at birth were abstracted from a medical chart review Gesta
tional age weeks was derived using both the woman s last
menstrual period LMP and ultrasound dating For this analysis
LMP is the preferred method for estimating gestational age since
ultrasound methods rely on fetal size to estimate gestational age
Nardozza et al If the two methods differed by days
then gestational age was determined using ultrasound due to
concerns over recall and reliability of the LMP estimate SGA births
were identified as those weighing less than the percentile for
a reference population based on the same completed week of
gestation and infant sex Kramer et al
Covariates
This analysis considered the effects of established predictors of
SGA age parity ethnicity country of origin household income

ABSTRACT
Background Fetal epigenetic programming plays a critical role in development DNA methyltransferase alpha
which is involved in de novo DNA methylation DNAm is a prime candidate gene as a mediator
between prenatal exposures and birth outcomes We evaluated the relationships between in utero arsenic As
exposure birth outcomes and DNAm
Methods In a prospective Bangladeshi birth cohort cord blood DNAm of three CPGs was measured
using bisulfite pyrosequencing Maternal toenail As concentrations at birth were measured to estimate in utero
exposure Among vaginal births N structural equation models SEMs were used to evaluate re
lationships between methylation toenail As birth weight and gestational age
Results In an adjusted SEM including birth weight and gestational age maternal toenail As levels were asso
ciated with DNAm B CI and gestational age B

DNAm was associated with gestational age B

and birth weight B g CI There was an indirect effect of As on gestational age
mediated through DNAm B

Cl
maternal toenail As levels on birth weight through pathways including gestational age B
g Cl
DNAm and gestational age B
g CI and maternal weight gain
and gestational age B g CI The total effect of a doubling in maternal toenail As
concentration is a decrease in gestational age of days CI and a decrease in birth weight of g

Conclusions plays a critical role in fetal epigenetic programming In utero arsenic exposure was as
sociated with greater methylation of CPGs in which partially mediated associations between prenatal
As exposure and birth outcomes Additional studies are needed to verify this finding

In utero and early life exposure has been asso

Farzan et al
Rahman et al
The teratogenic effects of As have been well established in rodent
models Ferm and Hanlon Hill et al Hood Hood
and Bishop Kozul Horvath et al Moore et al
Morrissey and Mottet et al Findings from
epidemiological studies of the association between in utero As exposure
and birth outcomes in humans have been inconsistent which is mostly
likely due to differences in study design exposure assessment sample
size population studied and levels of exposure Considering the cu
mulative evidence a recent review by Milton et al found an insufficient
number of studies addressing neonatal death and preterm birth but
consistent and convincing evidence of the association between high
As exposure and increased risk of spontaneous abortion stillbirth and
low birth weight
Milton et al
Additionally a meta analysis
conducted by Zhong et al found a negative association between in utero
As exposure and birth weight
Zhong et al
However little is
known regarding potential mechanisms by which arsenic would affect
these birth outcomes
Numerous epidemiological studies have examined the association
between in utero As exposure and birth weight shortened gestation
and or intrauterine grown restriction These birth outcomes have been
shown to have varying effects on disease risk later in life Wardlaw
et al
Shortened gestation is associated with increased risk of
infant mortality morbidity and disability whereas restricted in
trauterine growth is associated with decreased growth in childhood and
increased morbidity in later in life Several studies have evaluated birth
weight and gestational age as independent outcomes associated with in
utero As exposure finding no significant association with either out
come particularly at low levels of exposure Bloom et al Freire
et al
or a significant negative association with both outcomes
Xu et al
Mediation analyses including birth weight and ge
stational age may help to understand the health effects of in utero As
exposure For example in this cohort our group found that the in utero
As exposure was related to gestational age and maternal weight gain
during pregnancy and these factors mediated the effect between As and
birth weight
Kile et al
Subsequently there was no direct effect
of As on birth weight in this cohort
Changes in the epigenome including DNA methylation DNAm
may be one mechanism underlying the associations between As ex
posure and multiple health outcomes Bailey et al
et al As explained by the developmental origins of health and
disease hypothesis environmental exposures during embryogenesis a
time of cellular differentiation and epigenetic reprogramming may
result in epigenetic dysregulation and increased disease risk
Heindel
and Vandenberg The DNA methyltransferases alpha
and beta are responsible for de novo DNAm in
embryonic cells Okano et al
and have
differential spatial and temporal expression during early embryogenesis
may have a more significant role in
Uysal et al
maintaining global DNAm particularly at distal promotors and non
and in imprinting Kaneda et al
CpG sites
Gu et al
is also involved in RNA polymerase binding and transcription
genetic imprinting mitotic cell cycle protein binding aging and reg
ulation of cell death Although the role of in birth outcomes
has not fully been established DNAm within the gene body of
has previously been associated with reduced gestational age in a Nor
wegian birth cohort PFDR
Bohlin et al
Due to the critical role of in establishing de novo DNAm
we hypothesized that DNAm of this gene could mediate the association
between As exposure occurring in the critical prenatal development
phase and adverse birth outcomes specifically birth weight and ge
stational age We also hypothesized that gestational age would act as a
mediator between in utero As exposure epigenetic changes and birth
weight We explored this hypothesis using structural equation models
SEMs with our a priori hypothesis depicted in

Methods
Study population
Participants were from a prospective birth cohort of women exposed
to As through drinking water in Bangladesh in the Sirajdikhan and
Pabna Sadar upazilas This cohort has been described in detail pre
viously Kile et al Briefly women were recruited at s weeks
gestations age by Dhaka Community Hospital DCH Trust N
Eligibility criteria were having a single pregnancy using a tube well as
the main source of drinking water and planning to remain in the cur
rent residence for the duration of the pregnancy Women received free
prenatal care provided by DCH as well as prenatal vitamins which
were given to participants during monthly home visits Women gave
birth with DCH trained medical personnel at a local clinic or at their
home who collected all birth outcome data and cord blood was col
lected at birth This analysis utilized a sub sample of newborns
from the cohort that were selected for measurement of DNAm in whole
cord blood using pyrosequencing This sub sample was randomly se
lected across a range of arsenic exposure that was measured in the
household s drinking water We also restricted analyses to only vaginal
births to minimize the possibility of confounding which limited the
final sample size to newborns

Committees at the Harvard School of Public Health Oregon State
University and DCH Trust Prior to enrollment in the study informed
consent was obtained from all participants
Laboratory measures
Maternal toenail As Arsenic concentrations in maternal toenail
samples were measured as a biomarker of exposure during pregnancy
Arsenic has an affinity for sulfhydryl groups and accumulates in scler
oproteins and therefore toenail As concentrations at the distal tip re
presents a time integrated measure of ingested As during the previous
months of nail growth and has been shown in previous research to
be highly correlated with water arsenic concentrations Karagas et al
Rodrigues et al
Toenail clippings were collected from
mothers at the time of enrollment e g maternal toenails at enrollment
and within one month of delivery e g postpartum maternal toenails
The methods used to measure arsenic exposure have been previously
published Rodrigues et al Briefly samples were sonicated in
Triton X IOO solution Sigma Aldrich Inc St Louis MO and
rinsed in Milli Q water Millipore Corporation Billerica MA to remove
external contamination Then nails were digested in Trace Select Ultra

osequencing because they were included on the Illumina Infinium
BeadChip Our rationale for this choice was to
help make the pyrosequencing data in this study relevant to other
methylation array data Coverage also included two downstream CpG
sites and Bisulfite pyrosequencing
was performed at EpigenDx Hopkinton MA using ng ul whole
cord blood DNA Bisulfite conversion was used to convert unmethylated
cytosines to uracil Following PCR amplification and direct pyr
osequencing the average percent DNAm was calculated Control sam
ples with low methylation medium methylation and high methylation
were included on each plate
Covariates Sociodemographic data were collected by trained inter
viewers during clinical visits Infant birth weight was measured by
trained study staff using a pediatric scale calibrated before each use
Gestational age in weeks was determined by ultrasound measurements
taken at enrollment by a licensed general practitioner using either
Environmental Research
gestational sac mean diameter if the pregnancy was between and
weeks or crown rump length if the pregnancy was between and
weeks
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables Maternal
toenail As concentrations were right skewed and therefore trans
formed We assessed relationships between loci with quantified DNAm
and using Spearman
correlations Statistical mediation was evaluated using SEMs that in
cluded DNAm of all measured loci SEMs are a multivariate statistical
technique that allow for confirmatory analysis of a given hypothesis
Gunzler et al By simultaneously estimating multiple and re
lated regression like models SEMs allow for a given variable to act as
both an independent and dependent variable the term exogenous is
used to refer to variables that act only as independent variables and the
term endogenous is used to refer to variables that act as dependent
variables in at least one modeled regressions SEMs use underlying
latent or unmeasured variables defined by observed variables re
presenting same construct therefore addressing some forms of multi
collinearity DNAm of
and
was used as indicator variables to construct a latent
variable representing DNAm of Confirmatory factor analysis
was performed to test how well DNAm of the three CpG sites represent
DNAm of region
To understand the associations between As concentrations DNAm
of and birth weight independent of gestational age we first
built an SEM including logytransformed maternal toenail As con
centrations as independent variable birth weight as the dependent
variable and the latent variable representing DNAm of as a
mediator We similarly assessed associations between As concentra
tions DNAm of and gestational age independent of birth
weight A single SEM including both outcomes of interest birthweight
and gestational age was then used to assess mediation adjusting for
the potential confounders of infant sex and maternal education
primary vs primary education and the potential mediator of
maternal weight gain between enrollment and delivery Covariates
were selected based on a review of previous literature and observed
univariate associations between As exposure and birth outcomes in the
current study Birth weight was modeled in kg to ensure variances were
similarly scaled The full information maximum likelihood approach
FIML was used to estimate model parameters and robust estimates of
model fit were used due to skewness in DNAm variables Brosseau Liard
et al Brosseau Liard and Savalei For models including
categorical covariates i e infant sex and maternal education stan
dard errors were calculated from bootstrap samples In each
SEM model indices were examined to determine if including residual
correlations would improve model fit
Our primary measure of exposure was postpartum maternal toenail
As concentrations Toenail As concentrations provide a time integrated
biomarker of internal dose that reflects arsenic exposure from all routes
of exposure that occurred several months to a year prior to their col
lection
Kile et al
Therefore postpartum maternal toenail As
concentrations were selected to reflect the internal As dose that oc
curred during pregnancy We conducted sensitivity analyses using two
other arsenic exposure metrics maternal toenail As concentra
tions at enrollment and maternal water As concentrations In
addition we used linear models to test the associations between DNAm
of the target CpG site logytransformed postpartum
maternal toenail As concentrations birth weight and gestational age
Specifically we evaluated associations between the exposure maternal
toenail As concentration and outcome gestational age and birth
weight the mediator DNAm and the exposure maternal toenail As
concentrations and the mediator DNAm and the outcome gesta
tional age and birthweight

Consistent with our findings DNAm of the target CpG site
has previously been negatively associated with gesta
tional age in a Norwegian birth cohort PFDR
Bohlin et al
This study also found differential methylation throughout the
epigenome probes at for ultrasound estimated
gestational age and probes for last menstrual period estimate
gestational age at PFDR However additional CpG sites
annotated to were identified as differentially methylated and
a gene ontology GO analysis identified several pathways that included
the gene In addition in birth cohort in Tennessee one CpG
annotated to was identified as associated with gestational age
Parets et al
Methylation at additional CpG sites
PFDR
located in have been associated with the in utero environment
Specifically increased methylation in cord blood of cgl lo
cated within base pairs of the transcription start site has been
associated with lower maternal pre pregnancy BMI underweight

Watanabe et al However how may affect birth
outcomes is not well understood is involved in multiple di
verse biological pathways GO terms annotated to include
roles in DNAm RNA polymerase binding and transcription genetic
imprinting mitotic cell cycle protein binding aging and regulation of
cell death Further research is needed to understand the biological
pathways involved in the observed association between me
thylation and birth outcomes
Our study strengths included that gestational age was determined
by ultrasound at the time of enrollment which provides a more accu
rate estimation than reported last menstrual period In addition our
study is strengthened by the prospective birth cohort design with
multiple measures of As exposure during pregnancy Toenail As con
centrations reflect exposure during the prior several months to a year
Kile et al
Maternal toenail samples were collected within one
moth of delivery to provide an estimate of internal dose during preg
nancy and establish temporality Drinking water samples and maternal
toenail samples were also collected at the time of enrollment early in
pregnancy Overall results from sensitivity analyses using maternal
drinking water As levels and maternal toenail As concentration at en
rollment as the measures of exposure were consistent The slight dif
ferences in results could be a function of exposure misclassification
from using drinking water arsenic concentrations instead of biomarkers
of internal dose e g toenails or differences in As metabolism and
excretion between individuals Marchiset Ferlay et al
There is
evidence that the As metabolism may be associated with birth outcomes
Gelmann et al and may also influence DNAm Sex has also been
shown to influence arsenic metabolism Subsequently future studies
could examine As metabolism modifies DNAm of and birth
outcomes
Several limitations of our study should be noted We had missing
data on maternal toenail As concentrations N for maternal toe
nail concentrations at enrollment N for postpartum maternal

We did not have data on DNAm at additional CpG sites
and did not measure gene expression Therefore we cannot determine
if changes in DNAm at the interrogated CPGs of lead to
changes in gene expression or chromatin conformation Nor can we
infer that methylation at these CpG sites represent methylation across
the entire gene The three CPGs measured in the current study are lo

I INTRODUCTION
Population aging is a global phenomenon that has attracted
the attention of scientists and practitioners for many decades
In there were million people aged and over in
the world Most of them are women as they usually live
longer than men Over the next three decades the number of
older people worldwide is projected to increase to more than
double reaching over billion by The proportion of
the population aged and over is expected to increase from
in to approximately in
The aging process now covers almost all countries in the
world except which are defined by the UN as countries
with demographic differences In some countries this
process began in the middle of the last century in another in
the last decades Therefore the rate of population aging varies
from country to country Typically in countries where the
aging process has begun earlier the rate of aging is currently
low e g Sweden Fig l while in developing countries it is

II LITERATURE REVIEW
Many works of domestic and foreign scientists and
practitioners are devoted to the study of the problems of
population aging and its consequences In the context of the
purpose and objectives of this article several areas of research
can be identified the concept of demographic transition
general changes in age structure socio economic aspects of
this process the health of an aging population and challenges
to the health system

First of all it should be noted that the problem of
population aging has been the focus of international regional
and national institutions for many decades In particular the
UN whose experts publish annual reports Aging of the
world the World Health Organization conducts research
that highlights the results on the health and well being of
adults their relationship to the aging process in different
countries now and in the future in the reports Decade of
Healthy Aging Plan of Action World report on aging and
health Researchers of the US National Institute on Aging
and the US National Institutes of Health are conducting joint
research including Why Population Aging Matters
Due to the fact that population aging is one of the
manifestations of age structure transformation in the process
of demographic transition a special place in assessing the
peculiarities of the aging process belongs to the concept of
demographic transition
changing types of population
reproduction which is covered in a number of scientific
papers It is also worth noting that the assessment of the
age structure of the population and its future changes allows a
deeper understanding of the peculiarities of reproduction in
general and aging processes in particular
Scientists actively discuss the socio economic aspects of
population aging The research takes place in two
directions the impact of socio economic development on the
level of population aging and its socio economic
consequences
This topic is reflected in the works of Ukrainian scientists
The most fundamental work which highlights the latest
features of the aging population and its prospects the specifics
of lifestyle and socio economic status of the elderly the
challenges to social and economic development caused by
demographic aging is a collective monograph of scientists
from the Institute of Demography and Social Research named
after MV Ptukha of the National Academy of Sciences of
Ukraine
III CURRENT TRENDS OF AGING
Despite the general tendency of population aging in the
world the similarity of causes and effects there are some
differences between regions and countries More in depth
research shows that there is no hard standard for identifying
the causes of aging There are differences between countries
in the mode of reproduction in particular in the birth rate
gender and age structures which were formed in different
historical conditions were under the influence of various
factors wars epidemics pandemics economic crises
migration regimes predominance of emigration or
immigration etc The imposition of these and other
circumstances causes fluctuations in the rate of population
aging between countries and regions
Undoubtedly one of the main reasons that determine the
peculiarities of population aging are socio economic In fig
the dynamics of growth of the share of people aged
and older among the total population by countries with
different socio economic development Ukraine and some
European countries Sweden and Poland by sex is shown
The difference in population aging is quite significant
between countries with a high level of economic development
and countries with medium and low levels of development
And here the question is not only about the difference in
economic opportunities and what is connected with it the
level of medical and social services the state of health literacy
the quality of living and nutrition etc ie those determinants
that allow you to live longer Factors of such differentiation
are also indicators of a mode of reproduction In economically
developed countries birth rates and other marriage regimes
are significantly lower This may in some way explain the fact
that Ukraine which is not one of the countries with a high
level of economic development has a high rate of population
aging especially among women

Other features of aging which are shown in Fig First
of all they concern the difference in mortality rates between
men and women between different countries and regions It is
obvious that aging is greater among women than among men
However there are countries where this difference is quite
significant Thus in Ukraine the share of people years and
older among women exceeds the same figure for men by
times while on average in other countries this figure is
times In addition while over the last years the gap between
men and women and older in most countries has narrowed
in Ukraine it has widened In our opinion this indicates an
extremely unsatisfactory state of health of the male population
of the country in general and older age groups in particular

Taking into account the world experience of digital
transformation of the social sphere and developed domestic
approaches it is possible to verify further vectors of digital
transformation of the healthcare sphere of Ukraine which
should include introduction of valeological approaches in
providing medical services through prevention and health
promotion digital ecosystem of medical services which will
unite all subjects of their provision the transition from a
fragmented approach to health care delivery to the integration
and coordination of services during treatment
Covid stressed the vulnerability of an aging population
to new diseases Therefore at present the issue of healthy
aging is especially relevant
V METHODS OF CONSTRUCTING THE INDEX OF
POPULATION HEALTH
Health status index models have received a great deal of
attention in as a new quantitative approach for health
planning and health policy making Although at the present
time the models are mainly theoretical and experimental in
nature it is hoped that when they are fully developed and
ready for implementation they will contribute to rational
health planning in two ways first by providing a combined
morbidity mortality health index to measure the overall
health of a population and to allow comparisons of
populations on both a cross sectional and longitudinal basis
and second by providing a method of measuring the health
benefits of a health care program in general units to facilitate
the comparison of different programs in the establishment of
program priorities and in the allocation of limited resources
In Kaltenthaler et al published a systematic review
to identify articles describing population health indices and
their development Nevertheless Kaltenthaler et al
argued that a review on population health indices is beneficial
because indices may facilitate the consideration of allocating
and targeting health resources based on health needs from a
multidimensional perspective
In addition the development of health indices is
knowledgeable for understanding the nature of the factor
consequence relationships between the factors of health and
its level After all a population health index therefore
provides a summary measure of a certain health characteristic
at the population level
In order to better illustrate the aging process and the
impact on it of various factors it is advisable to use the health
index ISH which was proposed by one of the co authors of
the article Shushpanov D The health status index is
defined for each person as a composite index which consists
of the individual health index of the IIP person and the life
expectancy index of the ILE person according to the
The life expectancy index ILE is defined as a person s
age plus life expectancy at that age taking into account gender
and type of area The maximum life expectancy is assumed to
be years The minimum is years
According to the methodology of construction ISH
combines individual and general individual characteristics of
a person s health and general characteristics of the whole set
of persons taking into account their gender and living
conditions in a particular country It should be expected that
with age IIH will tend to decrease and ILE on the contrary
to increase Accordingly the compositional index ISH
balances these trends and thus adequately reflects the state of
health of a person based on potential expected processes and
the actual age reached in a particular country
Consider examples of calculation and use of indices and
characteristics of inequality for the population of Ukraine
Individual health characteristics are determined according to
a sample survey European Social Survey conducted by the
Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of
Ukraine in At the same time five levels of self esteem
are set for each person Accordingly the standardized values
are equal to
In fig show the features of the change of indices by age

Fig Men s health indices by age groups
It was found that for both men and women IIH is quite high
at a young age years but with age it significantly
decreases in men to at the age of years and older and
in women up to at the same age This is due to a decrease
in self esteem which is usually overestimated at a young age
and underestimated at an older age Especially women have
low self esteem Therefore they have a lower IIH

ILE on the other hand tends to grow As a result in men
aged years and in women aged years ILE and
IIH as well as ISH have the same values ISH is calculated as
the average between IIH and ILE We believe that such a
combination of macro level indicators life expectancy and
micro level indicators individual self assessment of a
person s state of health gives the most complete picture of the
state of health and can serve as a starting point for determining
policies to maintain and improve health
VI CONCLUSIONS
Many countries have been facing the problem of
population aging for more than a decade This list is updated
every year Thus this problem has become global The causes
of population aging are deformations of the sex age structure
of the population a decrease in the birth rate and an increase
in life expectancy
The study established the role of socio economic
development in the aging process and their relationship with
the reproduction regime It is established that there is a
relationship between the level of economic growth and
population aging although with some exceptions in particular
for Ukraine Peculiarities of aging by sex are revealed It is
determined that in Ukraine there is a significant differentiation
in the aging rates between men and women which is
associated with high mortality rates among men
In the conditions of aging it is important to ensure a
healthy old age The realities of today during the COVID
pandemic have shown that the most vulnerable and
vulnerable are the elderly In Ukraine the mortality rate of the
population aged and over remains one of the highest in
Europe especially mortality due to diseases of the circulatory
system According to the results of the author s research the
structure of the prevalence of diseases among the elderly
includes diseases of the circulatory system diseases of the
digestive system musculoskeletal system and connective
tissue
Sociological research has identified determinants that
largely determine the health of the elderly population The
chance assessment method found that the chances of having a
chronic disease of the circulatory system increase with
declining socio economic status among divorced widowed
and smokers
The main task of the health care system in aging is a
systematic and comprehensive approach should cover all
periods of life and is relevant not only for those who are
currently healthy

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objectives This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of contraceptive methods self
reported by men in England over years focusing on condoms in comparison to any male method
and explore condom as a contraceptive method by region and ethnicity
Study design Data were from the Sexual and Reproductive Health Services Contraception England
census data set from to Once missing data were removed this left a total of
men Two binomial logistic regression models were performed Model examined ethnicity region and
time on condom as a method of contraception and Model examined ethnicity region and time by any
male contraceptive Descriptive statistics were run for natural family planning and spermicide
Results Model revealed a significant model P and predicted that condoms as
a method decreased in London with a greater decrease in Midlands London saw the lowest rate of
decline among the non White ethnic group whereas North and South regions increased probability over
time The North started at a higher probability and the South at the lowest Model also revealed a
significant model P with a similar pattern to Model Contingency tables
showed natural family planning and spermicide were the least reported methods and decreased over
time
Conclusions As any male contraceptive method appears to be decreasing in both models reproductive
health promotion is required This study has implications for commissioning funds and for identifying
regional areas of further investigation

A rich history of men and family planning as part of the global
agenda and how this relates to the United Kingdom have already
been documented l While the United Kingdom has yet to report
successful interventions several low and middle income coun
tries have already reported success engaging men For example
research in Malawi suggests that increased communication among
couples is mediated by an increase in knowledge and a decrease in
male opposition within the couple this is described as an essential
part of the intervention s success Despite the United Kingdom
having a history of providing aid for family planning to low and

middle income countries for targeted programming albeit this aid
has recently been cut the United Kingdom has invested very little
funding into research on their own men s family planning practices
including men s use of condoms for contraception natural family
planning or spermicide as a method of contraception leaving little
understanding of men and contraception There is now a public
health movement beginning in the United Kingdom for men to
responsibly ejaculate or in other words take primary re
sponsibility for contraception for which there are currently bar
riers The literature suggests there is a need to further understand
men s choice of contraception to be effective with increasing up
take and overcoming barriers to primary responsibility However
before we can begin to overcome barriers we must start with more
effective data collection techniques and advanced analysis in pub
lished reports to guide decision making For a more in depth re
view of the literature see Supplemental Materials

Aims and exploration
This study objective was to build upon the research of Pearson
and Pearson and Clarke using the same source of national data sets
to understand condoms natural family planning and spermicide as
a contraceptive method of men by region in England over years
from to The data sets available from the National
Health System NHS clinics have some identified limitations by
Pearson and Pearson and Clarke for example the data set lacked
complete demographic information on men such as age although
age was recorded for women Furthermore the data were un
available on men who attend for family planning purposes as part
of a couple because the patient in a couple was recorded to be the
woman partner However some limited information was provided
regarding the ethnic background of men again little is currently
known about how ethnic background informs contraceptive
method reported among men in the United Kingdom Therefore
the second objective of this study was to then explore ethnicity and
contraceptive as a method by men in England It is to the authors
knowledge the first study to begin to understand condom as a
method by region over time It is also the first study to look at
natural family planning and spermicide as a method of contra
ception by men in England
Method
The study was a secondary analysis of data from the NHS Con
traceptive Services England Community contraceptive services
therefore according to the University Ethics Committee this study
was exempt from ethical approval as the data are in the public
domain The primary focus of the data is contraceptive care and the
variable for condoms is labeled by NHS Digital as contraceptive
method and implies that the data collected is for family planning
purposes Therefore it is assumed that the data collected is on
condoms for contraceptive purposes The census is run on a yearly
basis from April to March each year and is considered the most
comprehensive sexual and reproductive service information
resource for the United Kingdom The non disclosive data set
census used for this study included
and The cutoff year was as
these data were collected before the COVID pandemic which
has affected those men who use contraceptive clinics and would
not make for a meaningful comparison at this stage A total of
men participated in the national census from to
The data points are entered by the service provider which includes
national regional and local authorities
Previous research sug
gests this is predominantly nurse practitioners in the United
Kingdom
Data set characteristics
The female participants were removed from the data set using
an excel macro to ensure only male responses were used Similar to
Pearson and Pearson and Clarke there was only one classification
value for males H Male all ages and all observations matching
this value comprised the overall dataset N A robust
sample was an essential part of the inclusion criteria and the
sample consists of data only from the regions of England North
Midlands London and South for a map of these regions see Office
for National Statistics ONS The rationale for
excluding responses outside of England is that there was not
enough data collected over the years on participants from
Northern Ireland n Scotland n and Wales n to
warrant inclusion in the analyses However while limited to En
gland participants did not have to be British nationals to be
Public Health
included as participants foreign nationals could present at services
and were recorded as part of the data set although nationality was
not recorded The remaining men s contraceptive method was
either not recorded or they were using no contraceptive at all
potentially reliant on female methods but exactly how many men
fell into these subgroups was not clear within the data set Once
missing data on contraceptive method was removed from the data
set there was a total of men s data left to analyze With
speculation that some of the excluded with missing data
may have been using the service for sexual health not contracep
tion however without better data collection methods this could
not be confirmed Method as a variable meant the patient reported
what their method of contraception was to the clinician To create
the contraceptive method variable the main method secondary
method and third method were combined into one variable to
measure any method of contraception It did not mean that the
method of contraception was given to the participant or used by
them in practice Therefore this data set then looked at self
reported methods of contraception not contraceptive use Each
year s data were initially combined into a singular data set with
filtering then occurring for each year s data to provide a view of
self reported contraceptive methods over time
Analytic techniques
Two binomial logistic regression models were performed The
first model examined the effect of ethnicity region and time on
condom as a method of contraception The second model examined
the effect of ethnicity region and time on any contraceptive as a
method in comparison to no contraceptive method All P values
reported were two tailed Furthermore two contingency tables
were performed to understand both natural family planning not
defined in the data set by ethnicity region and time as well as for
spermicide by ethnicity region and time R studio was used to
analyze the data All statistical analyses were conducted using
packages in the R statistical environment version
Pack
ages in the R statistical environment refers to additional modules
within R that allow specific analyses to be conducted All the data
were prepared using the R package dplyr
Results
Sociodemographics
The number of males per year were
and from to This shows a steady
decrease from to with the number of men attending
contraceptive services reduced by more than half In the overall
data set were White and were non White The
responses for the ethnic group not known stated were filtered from
the data set because of the lack of clarity whether this was missing
data or the participant refused to answer the question For any
method of contraception overall men reported condom as
a main method of contraceptive reported natural family
planning reported spermicide and men did not report a
main contraceptive method Overall n of men
were recorded as using the clinic as their main contact
n were contacting the clinic for the first time of
men attended a primary healthcare center n with the
majority choosing to maintain their current contraceptive
method n It is acknowledged that n
of men received both contraception and sexual health advice
suggesting they may choose condoms for dual protection contra
ception and sexually transmitted infections STIs However
whether the sexual health advice was sought by the men or
A Jordan and A D Wilson
whether condoms were chosen for dual protection or for non
contraceptive use cannot be distinguished in the data collected
While of men in this study reported that it was their first
contact for their contraceptive method of men reported that
it was not their first contact and they were maintaining their cur
rent contraceptive method Patient identification numbers are used
for every visit to ensure accurate reporting such as ensuring mul
tiple visits are accurately recorded but these identification
numbers are not shared as part of the data set for confidentiality
The researcher therefore chose to include men with
reasons
first and second contacts for contraceptive method as it could not
be determined when the men first accessed the service although
this may bias the data set The frequency and percentages for the
overall data set by demographic category can be found in Table
Model Ethnicity region year and condom as a method
The model used simultaneous forced entry of the variables and
dummy coding of the ethnicity and region variable with those of
White ethnicity and the North region treated as the reference
values respectively This resulted in a significant model
P see Table
for parameter estimates
standard errors and P values
The model revealed that when compared with those in the
North region condom as a method for those of White ethnicity in
the South region had a significantly lower log odds of method at
year O Those of White ethnicity in the London region
had significantly higher log odds and those of White ethnicity in
the Midlands region had no significant difference compared with
those of White ethnicity in the North region Furthermore those of
non White ethnicity had a higher log odds of using condom as a
method at year O when compared with those of non White
ethnicity in the North region The log odds of condom as a
method for those of non White ethnicity at year were lower in the
South and London regions but higher in the Midlands region in
comparison to those of non White ethnicity in the Midlands see
for parameter estimates standard errors and P values
Table
The model also revealed that the log odds of condom as a
method increased over time for those of White ethnicity in the
North region This increase was of a larger magnitude in the South
region but there was a decrease over time in log odds of the
method in the Midlands and London regions Those of non White
ethnicity in the North region had no significant difference
compared with those of White ethnicity in the North region in log
odds of condom as a method over time Compared with the log
odds of condom as a method of those of non White ethnicity in
the North region there was an increase in log odds over time for
those of non White ethnicity in the London region However there
was no significant difference in log odds of condom as a method for
those of non White ethnicity over time in the Midlands and South
regions when compared with the log odds of the method for non
White ethnicities in the North
Overall the model shows that the predicted probability of
condom as a method of contraception for non White and White
ethnicities decreased in the London and Midlands regions over
time and this decrease was at a greater rate in the Midlands region
The rate of decrease over time was slower for non White ethnicities
in the London region The North and South regions had an increase
in predicted probability of condom as a method over time but the
North started as a high predicted probability of the method and the
absolute change is not large in magnitude In contrast the South
started with lowest predicted probability of condom as a method
than all other regions but had the highest rate of increase White
ethnicities had a lower predicted probability of the method across
all time points for all regions

Principal findings
In summary the results from our study show that the Midlands
of England have the lowest rates of condom as a main method of
contraception followed by men in London The North and South of
England showed slight increases in condoms and other male con
traceptives Irrespective of year the White ethnic group self report
condoms as a method of contraception less than the non White
ethnic group For the White ethnic group the odds of self
reporting condoms as a contraceptive method decreased yearly in
the Midlands and London regions but the North and South regions
increased yearly Comparatively the overall pattern was almost
identical in the non White ethnic group although at higher odds of
condoms as a contraceptive method across all regions at all time
points However a key difference between ethnicities was seen in
the London region where the White ethnic group decreased over
time at a significantly greater rate Model predicted the self
report of any male contraceptive method and showed a similar
pattern to Model where any male method was decreasing and
uptake was less among men who identified as White than men who
did not identify as White Any male contraceptive method included
condoms natural family planning and spermicide A comparison
was run to understand if the decrease in condoms could be
explained by an increase in other male methods The results sug
gest that the decrease in condoms cannot be explained by an in
crease in any male method Furthermore the White ethnic group
did not self report any form of male method at a higher rate than
the non White ethnic group
rate of increase White ethnicities had a lower predicted probability
of any contraceptive method across all time points for all regions
However in the South and North regions the probabilities appear
to be on a converging path

Methodological implications of ethnicity as a variable
Ethnicity is an irrational variable in the data set it has been
oversimplified and service users are limited to choose from three
categories White non White and other unknown This creates a
binary other White vs non White This approach is an essentialist
view of ethnic background that problematically stereotypes groups
as having one true identity that is biological driven Instead
research suggests that the option should be provided to service users
to self identify as well as providing the ability to give non standard
responses for the complexity of the variable to be explored and new
constructions of ethnic categories to emerge without stigmatization
and discrimination
Furthermore by taking a homogenous
approach to the White ethnic group this ignores other groups that
face disadvantage such as White Irish individuals residing in En
gland While ethnicity is commonly characterized in a problematic
way of race by using skin color the relationship between ethno
cultural group and sexual behavior is important when developing
health based interventions
For example research on Black
Caribbean and Black African heterosexual men show differences in
health care utilization and prognosis for sexual health and STIs
Individuals from mixed racial backgrounds also have differences in
sexual health behaviors for example risk taking among heterosex
ual sexual health clinic service users was highest among Black mixed
Caribbean heterosexual men with this group being most likely to
test positive for STIs These studies show how further ethnic
categorization within a subgroup such as Black and mixed ethnic
backgrounds could be beneficial to better understand how culture
informs condoms for reproductive purposes They suggest that for
the purpose of interventions both social and cultural identities
cannot be isolated from the public health approach Overall there
is a need to provide a more precise understanding of ethnic identity
for the purpose of data collection Owing to the barriers with
ethnic grouping very little can be generalized from the data set but
the model does show that ethnicity and condoms as a method for
contraception are a point requiring further enquiry
Research implications
What the above critical lens suggests is this study s regional
information would be helpful not only to target certain regions for
interventions but also to tailor the interventions to each region
differently Historically and currently there is no published record
of an intervention around improving the use of condoms by men
for contraceptive purposes in England Any larger intervention or
randomized control trial should focus on clinics from all four re
gions to account for variations in condoms as a method of contra
ception or focus on the Midlands to understand why condoms are
reported less for contraception in this region to aim to improve
condom uptake over time For a discussion of natural family plan
ning and spermicide as well as recommendations for the NHS see
Supplemental Materials
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is it provides the first insight into
research on men who live in England s self reported method of
contraception for condoms natural family planning and spermicide
Future research is also needed on male contraceptive methods
because this census data was unable to capture use only self reports
of a method Both the models on condoms and any contraceptive
were significant at the level suggesting the models are a good
fit The limitations of the study included that the data were not
collected by the research team therefore there was little that could
be done to influence the variables available for analysis
Public Health
Furthermore although the focus is stated by NHS Digital to be pri
marily on contraceptive care and the variable is labeled as such in all
data sets the three types of men using this service contraceptive
sexual health both cannot be determined Dividing the three data
points in future data collection is important before any causation can
be determined as it would be advantageous even in this data set to
know whether when separated if the three groups decreased or
increased their choice of contraceptives respectively to better inform
targeted services and programs In addition NHS Digital should add
variables to the data on sexual and reproductive care activity to
include divisions between sexual health advice sought and sexual
health advice provided This division could be a quality check for if
men were using condoms for contraception sexual health or both
purposes which cannot be determined or quality checked in the
census currently Also in this study a comparison was run to see if
the decrease in condoms could be accounted for by other male
contraceptive methods increasing In the future to address the issue
in this study of causation it would be key to have a balanced sample
of men using each of the male methods for an in depth comparison
With a more extensive set of sociodemographic variables for men
greater understanding can be applied including possible explana
tions and implications for clinicians and policymakers For further
limitations see the NHS data quality statements publicly available
online by following the citations for the data sets For example the
data lack representation where a male patient contacts an outpatient
clinic a General Practice a community pharmacist or a retail setting
reporting condoms as a contraceptive method Including both men
who made first contact for their method of contraception and men
for whom it was not their first contact that they were maintaining
their method did not influence the trends of the regression models
in this study but could have biased the results This was because the
sample of men maintaining was too small to change the analysis
outcome or to make a meaningful comparison but it could have
implications in a larger data set and seeking a balanced data set is
important for making conclusions and comparisons in the future
research The data set was limited in reporting patient identification
methods and the NHS Digital should devise a system to reduce
duplicate data points in the data sets and to allow for longitudinal
analysis Finally if the individual is or years their data are
also not included which is problematic as they may have a method
of contraception at this age
Conclusion
In all this is the first study to take a comprehensive overview of
several contraceptive methods including condoms natural family
planning and spermicide all male methods The results from the
regression models predict which regions and which ethnic groups
are more likely to report condoms as a method of contraception and
which groups report any male contraceptive method These models
are helpful to begin to explore differences between regions to inform
commissioning and determined that the decrease in condoms is not
explained by an increase of any male method Several important
targeted approaches toward data collection have been suggested to
improve our understanding of men s contraceptive methods in En
gland with health promotion and policy makers requiring more
evidence based research to inform messages commissioning and
policies when aiming to engage men in family planning behaviors

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Increased efforts have focused on reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in the United
States US Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy chronic hypertension diabetes mellitus very advanced
maternal age and grand multiparity are known contributors to various maternal morbidities as well as
maternal mortality We aimed to evaluate the trends in these risk factors complications among US pregnan
Cies during the last three decades
Methods This is a retrospective study based on the CDC natality database We calculated the annual preva
lence of each risk factor complication from to Joinpoint regression analysis was then used to eval
uate the trends Annual percentage changes APC were calculated for each of the segments identified by the
joinpoint regression and average annual percentage changes AAPC were calculated for the entire period
Relative risks RR comparing the prevalence of each risk factor complication in to its prevalence in
were also calculated Subsequent analyses evaluated the trends of the main risk factors complications
by maternal age groups Statistical significance was determined at p and results were presented with
confidence intervals
Findings Between and the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increased by
AAPC CI that of chronic hypertension increased by AAPC CI that
of diabetes mellitus increased by AAPC CI that of very advanced maternal age
increased by AAPC CI and that of grand multiparity increased by AAPC
CI Chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus increased mostly during the past two decades while
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and grand multiparity increased primarily over the most recent decade
Additionally women of very advanced maternal age had significantly higher rates of hypertensive disorders
of pregnancy chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus throughout our study period
Interpretation Our study shows a marked increase in the prevalence of five pregnancy risk factors complica
tions over the past three decades This may point to a significant deterioration in the health of
US pregnant women which potentially contributes to both maternal morbidity and mortality

Maternal mortality rates in the United States US have more than
doubled during the past three decades increasing from per
live births in to per live births in
Significant increases have also been documented throughout
the years in the prevalence of indicators for severe maternal morbid

It was estimated that severe maternal
morbidities affected more than US women in
The reasons for the increasing trends in maternal morbidity and
mortality are not entirely clear Changes in the pre conception health
of pregnant women trends of delaying childbearing increased rates
of cesarean deliveries
as well as racial and ethnic disparities
have been suggested as major contributors Improvements in the
level of surveillance and identification of pregnancy related morbid
ities and mortalities have also played an important role
In this study we aim to extend prior research and evaluate the
trends in several major pregnancy risk factors and complications

Evidence before this study
E Bomstein et al EClinicalMedicine
Prior studies have documented increasing rates of hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy chronic hypertension diabetes melli
tus very advanced maternal age and grand multiparity among
pregnant women in the United States US These studies were
typically limited by either the size of the sampled population or
the length of the time period examined as well as by the statis
tical method used to evaluate temporal trends We searched
PubMed for any article published up to March referring
to the prevalence and trends in hypertensive disorders of preg
nancy pregnancy induced hypertension gestational hyper
tension preeclampsia eclampsia chronic hypertension
diabetes mellitus pre gestational diabetes gestational diabe
tes advanced maternal age maternal age grand multiparity
and parity
Added value of this study
We document a marked increase in the prevalence of several
maternal risk factors complications hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy chronic hypertension diabetes mellitus very
advanced maternal age and grand multiparity among the
entire population of US pregnant women over the last years
to The added value of this study stems from evalu
ating these trends on the entire population of US pregnant
women and over such an extended period of time In addition
by conducting joinpoint regression analyses we are able to
illustrate the temporal changes of the trends in each of these
risk factors complications throughout our year study period
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results point to a significant and continuous deterioration
in the health of US pregnant women over the past three deca
des which has been especially prominent during the last
decade Understanding the trends in maternal risk factors com
plications could help identify the potential root causes for the
increasing rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the US
as well as target intervention measures to curtail these trends
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy HDP chronic hypertension
CH diabetes mellitus DM very advanced maternal age vAMA
and grand multiparity GM among US gravidas during the three
decade period between and Understanding the long term
trends in these risk factors complications can potentially help clarify
the underlying reasons for the increasing rates of maternal morbidity
and mortality in the US during this time period
Methods
Data and risk factor definitions
This is a retrospective cohort study for the year period from
to Data regarding the annual cases of live births compli
cated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy chronic hypertension
diabetes mellitus very advanced maternal age and grand multipar
ity as well as the total number of live births per year were collected
from the National Center for Health Statistics natality files The data
for were accessed through the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention s CDC Wonder system The data for
were collected from the National Vital Statistics Reports
For
parity the Wonder system only included data since
and
data for all prior years were collected from the National Vital Statis
tics Reports The data include all live births occurring to US resi
dents within the United States
Data on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy HDP defined as
gestational hypertension mild and severe preeclampsia eclampsia
and HELLP syndrome chronic hypertension CH and diabetes mel
litus DM includes pre gestational type I diabetes pre gestational
type II diabetes and gestational diabetes are available in the natality
files since following the implementation of the revision of
the US Standard Certificate of Live Birth These data remain compara
ble throughout the year period until Very advanced mater
nal age vAMA was identified from data on the age group of the
mother and defined as women who were years or older at the
time of delivery Grand multiparity GM was identified from detailed
parity data and defined as women with at least five live births For
each risk factor complication incomplete records were excluded
Statistical analyses
For every year between and we calculated the annual
prevalence of HDP CH DM vAMA and GM as percentages of live
births Subsequently we evaluated the temporal trends in each preg
nancy risk factor complication by way of joinpoint regression analy
sis conducted using the Joinpoint Regression Program Version
by the National Cancer Institute The joinpoint regression
method is used to detect changes in data trends In our application it
was set to fit a model of connected straight lines to a logarithmic
transformation of the data For each potential number of joinpoints
i e points in which the trend changes between O and the loca
tions of the joinpoints were determined via the grid method by cre
ating a grid of all possible joinpoint locations fitting a model to each
possibility and choosing the model with the lowest sum of squared
errors SSE Then the best model with the optimal number of
joinpoints was chosen by comparing the models with the different
number of joinpoints and testing whether more joinpoints were sta
tistically significant Statistical significance was tested via the permu
tation method by running Monte Carlo simulations The
reported results of the model include the locations of the joinpoints
the annual percentage change APC for each segment of the trend
equal to the year over year change in the rate under the assump
tion that this change is constant for the segment and the average
annual percentage change AAPC for the full time period equal to a
weighted average of all of the APCs In addition as an alternative
method Pearson chi square testing was used to compare the preva
lence of each risk factor complication in to its prevalence in
with results presented as relative risks RR This analysis was
conducted using SAS Version In subsequent analyses we calcu
lated the proportion of pregnancies in each of six maternal age
groups under years years years years
years and at or above years of age as well as the preva
lence of HDP CH and DM among these age groups for every year
between and For every age group the temporal trends of
HDP CH and DM were then evaluated by way of the joinpoint
regression method as well as by calculating relative risks
For all tests statistical significance was determined as a p value
below and results were reported with associated confi
dence intervals CI

Discussion
Our study documents dramatic increases in the prevalence of sev
eral pregnancy risk factors complications HDP CH DM vAMA and
GM among US pregnant women during the last three decades For
CH and DM these increases have primarily occurred since the late
early and for HDP and GM they were more pronounced
since the mid late Although the trends in HDP CH and DM
were observed in all age groups vAMA women consistently had
higher rates of these risk factors complications compared to women
in younger age groups This is especially disturbing as the proportion
of pregnancies to vAMA women has also grown during this time
period
Our findings are consistent with several smaller studies that
reported increases in the rates of HDP CH DM vAMA and GM
among different samples of pregnant women in the US and during

using one consistent and comparable dataset with years of rele
vant data we are able to document the long term increasing tempo
ral trends in HDP CH DM vAMA and GM between and
as well as to illustrate the changes in these trends throughout the
years
The prevalence of HDP increased significantly from in
to in AAPC of and RR of After stabilizing in the
late early the prevalence of HDP has increased dramati
cally over the most recent decade in all age groups Figs
and
and
Table This is concerning as HDP is still a major cause of
maternal mortality responsible for approximately of the preg
nancy related deaths that occurred between and
as well as a major contributor to various severe maternal morbidities
The reasons for the increasing trend in the prevalence of HDP are
not well understood but prior research has suggested increasing
rates of co morbidities such as obesity chronic hypertension CH
diabetes mellitus DM advanced maternal age AMA and multiple
gestations as potential explanations
l However while we find
that HDP is indeed more prevalent among vAMA women Fig
the
long term trend that we document in HDP behaves quite differently
from the trends of CH DM and vAMA Figs and Table Simi
larly it does not correspond to the well documented long term con
tinuous increase in obesity rates among pregnant women
Therefore while all of these suggested reasons may contribute to the
increased prevalence of HDP our results suggest that there may be
additional contributing factors Further research is needed to explore
these potential factors
The prevalence of CH rose dramatically since with an espe
cially high APC during the last couple of years Nowadays CH which
affected only of pregnant women in the has
become significantly more common with a prevalence of in
and Table Potential factors that may have contrib
Figs
uted to this increase include increasing rates of obesity and AMA
and indeed we find that the prevalence of CH among women
with vAMA was more than double the overall prevalence Nonethe
less higher relative increases in the rates of CH i e higher AAPCs and
RRs among younger women during the past years have made CH
a noteworthy risk factor even among young women
Fig
Similarly the prevalence of DM has more than doubled since the
early growing continuously at disturbing rates Figs and
Table Poor dietary habits physical inactivity as well as increasing
rates of obesity and AMA have been reported as potential contribu
tors to this increase General improvements in mater
nal screening and detection processes as well as changes in
diagnostic criteria and reporting practices may have also played a
role
Part of the increase that we document can also be
attributed to the revision of the US Standard Certificate of Live
Birth which was adopted in a staggered fashion across states until
and has been found to increase the reported rates of DM
l In any case in DM affected of pregnant women
DM among pregnant women is a known contributor to maternal
morbidity and mortality In fact Nelson et al found
that of the increase in maternal mortality rates in the US
between and was attributed to the increase in the preva
lence of DM
Of specific concern is that during the most recent
decade the prevalence of DM has grown among vAMA women at an
especially high AAPC so that an astounding of vAMA women
in were affected by DM Fig
The prevalence of vAMA increased significantly over the last three
decades and primarily in the Figs and Table
In fact
over the last three decades the proportion of pregnancies attribut
able to women in all of the age groups at or above the age of
increased but the most notable increase was for vAMA women
whose proportion of pregnancies grew threefold from in
This increase can be explained by the
to in Fig
significant advancement in reproductive therapies during the
and by the continuous trend of delaying family planning which can
potentially be attributed to improved access to education and contra
ception as well as to an increased focus on the career development
of women
Prior research has found that women at or above
the age of have higher rates of various pregnancy risk factors and
complications as well as an increased risk of maternal mortality
Our findings confirm these results Specifically we find
that older women with vAMA consistently had a higher prevalence
of HDP throughout the years Fig and that the prevalence of both
CH and DM consistently increased with age peaking in the vAMA age
group Figs Nonetheless our study documents significant
increases in the prevalence of HDP CH and DM across all age groups
and further solidifies their position as major risk factors complica
tions among all pregnant women in the US
The overall increase in the prevalence of GM was relatively mod
erate during the past three decades but practically all of this increase
has occurred since In of live births were attributed
to grand multiparous women Figs

Background Despite the enormous advantages of early pregnancy related problem diagnosis and therapy during prenatal care
Visits not all pregnant women begin antenatal care at the proper time Thus this study aims to identify factors associated with
missed opportunities for antenatal care service utilization among reproductive age women in Eastern Ethiopia Methods A
mixed methods study design quantitative and qualitative was conducted in Grawa Meta and Haramaya woredas from
September to December The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version A multivariable logistic
regression analysis model was used to identify the predictors Statistical software programs based on ATLAS ti version was
were used to conduct the thematic analysis of the qualitative data Results Overall missed opportunities for antenatal care
were of Factors such as maternal age being AOR CI having a college
education AOR CI elementary AOR CI and secondary education
AOR CI having five and more parity AOR CI three visits AOR
CI those in the first trimester AOR CI and the second trimester AOR
CI and get information from a health facility AOR O CI and traditional birth attendance
AOR CI were factors statistically associated with outcome variables Conclusions According to this
report relatively high proportions of pregnant women experienced missed opportunities in antenatal care follow up Factors
such as maternal age education parity frequency timing and media access were statistically significantly correlated with
missed antenatal care follow up Therefore all stakeholders should emphasize advocating for and enhancing the benefits of
antenatal care this in turn plays a crucial role in increasing the follow up of clients for these crucial services Moreover health
policy implementers need to coordinate their tracking of pregnant women who missed their antenatal care session
Introduction
Globally an estimated million women died from com
plications related to pregnancy childbirth and postpartum
period Every day about pregnant women pass
away from curable or preventable pregnancy related condi
tions Among these ninety nine percent of women
die in developing countries due to pregnancy and childbirth
Even though maternal mortality is a global issue its
major issues are most felt in underdeveloped countries As
a result developing nations account for percent of the esti
mated global number of maternal fatalities with an estimated
of those deaths happening in sub Saharan Africa
Quality antenatal care accessible obstetrics care and
life saving interventions are critical services for reducing
preventable maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity
Bringing the global maternal death rate down to fewer
than per live births is a key component of
Sustainable Development Goal SDG To eliminate
preventable causes of maternal death due to pregnancy
related complications existing interventions during preg
nancy and delivery must be scaled up Hemorrhage hyper
tension and infection are the leading causes of maternal death
The most common causes of newborn deaths and
stillbirths are asphyxia prematurity and infections and the
majority are preventable with existing evidence based inter
ventions either directly or indirectly during pregnancy labor
delivery and postpartum
Despite the fact that universal coverage of antenatal care
services is reported globally and at the country level many
pregnant women in developing countries do not benefit
from comprehensive antenatal care due to factors such as
late initiation and poor quality of antenatal care services
Early initiation during the first trimester and qual
ity antenatal care throughout the pregnancy have been
shown to improve pregnancy outcomes and increase new
born survival However in developing countries only
of pregnant women initiated antenatal care before
weeks of gestation and of pregnant women did not
complete four antenatal care visits
Despite the disparities in maternal death rates across
developed and developing countries studies have demon
strated that the pattern of maternal mortality and morbidity
has remained constant throughout time The reasons given
for this include the long standing custom of having births
at home in risky and unclean settings with untrained or
inadequately qualified delivery attendants
In Ethiopia the maternal death ratio decreased from
new births in to in This
puts Ethiopian women at a much higher risk than their
counterparts in the developed world where the risk was esti
mated to be in and in in nations like
Greece and Poland respectively As a result the likelihood
of an Ethiopian woman dying from reproductive health dis
orders and complications was put at in in in
in and in in
Despite the government s and numerous stakeholders
dedication to advocating for and enhancing the benefits of
antenatal care the prevalence of missed opportunities and
factors influencing them remain unabated Additionally to
researchers knowledge there is a dearth of published mate
rial pertaining to missed opportunities and their related
causes in the study region Furthermore there is no single
study that employed qualitative methods to dig out the var
iable under study As a result this study assessed the preva
lence of missed opportunities and associated factors in the
study area
Methods and Materials
Study Design Setting and Period A mixed methods
study cross sectional quantitative method and phenome
nology qualitative method was conducted from September
to December among pregnant women
in Grawa Meta and Haramaya woredas This study site
namely Haramaya Meta and Grawa is situated in Eastern
Ethiopia and kilometers from the capital city
Journal of Pregnancy
of Ethiopia Addis Ababa According to data from the wor
eda health offce in the populations of the districts
were and Of these reproductive
age groups account for a total population of Most
residents make their living through farming and small
scale trading Figure
Population and Eligibility Criteria All woreda dwelling
women of reproductive age who had given birth within the
previous five years of the data gathering were considered
the source population whereas randomly selected women
using the sampling technique who were available during
the data collection period were regarded as the study popu
lation The inclusion criteria were women who were permanent
residents who lived more than one year in the study area in
the selected districts and women whose ages were between
and years Women with hearing impairments or communi
cation impairment conditions as well as those who were criti
cally ill had mental health issues or had been alive for less
than a year at the time of the interview were excluded
Sample Size Determination and Sampling Procedures
The sampling size was computed by using a single popula
tion ratio formula based on the assumption that to get the
largest sample size possible and in light of the lack of prior
prevalence statistics on the population being studied p was
taken to be Additionally a confidence interval
and a margin of error were established Z
women aged between and years made up the
majority of the total population N and a sample
size of women was determined using a contingency
for nonresponse
A three stage sampling approach was used in this investi
gation of the total kebeles in each district were included
in the initial stage As the number of kebeles varies in the three
districts proportional sampling to give equal weights was used
As a result samples were taken from percent of
kebeles in Grawa percent in Meta and percent in
Haramaya Based on the size of the population
kebeles and HHs from Haramaya kebeles and
HHs from Meta and kebeles and HHs from Grawa
were selected for the sample of kebeles and homes HHS A
lottery technique was used to choose the respondents with vil
lages being selected at random Last but not least research
subjects took samples from kebeles in the three woredas a total
of study samples were chosen utilizing a systematic sam
pling technique Then each patient was given a unique code

two public health professionals who are familiar with the
study s environment Three days of training on ethics tools
sampling and data collection techniques was given to data
collectors and supervisors Daily oversight of the data gath
ering process was provided and the data collectors received
prompt feedback
Variables and Their Measurement Antenatal care
ANC is the proportion of women aged to who gave
birth alive and got prenatal care four or more times within
a specific time period
Missed opportunities in maternal and infant health
research are built on the premise that considerable chances
for enhancing mother and child health have been missed
or might have been avoided and that a better arrangement
and focus on postpartum care will lower maternal morbidity
and death
A traditional birth attendant TBA is a person who
assists a mother during prenatal and postpartum care and
who initially acquired her skills by delivering babies herself
or through apprenticeship to other traditional birth atten
dants
Data Quality Control A bilingual expert Afaan Oromo
created the questionnaire in English before translating it into
the regional tongues To guarantee uniformity it was then
translated back into an English version The supervisor and
data collectors both got training on the methods and tools for
collecting data of the study participants took a pretest in
a setting similar to research data collection Regular oversight
was given by the investigators and skilled research supervisors
Data Processing and Analysis The acquired information
was initially checked for consistency and completeness
Then for further analysis they were cleaned coded and
put to EpiData version The entered data were trans
ferred to SPSS version for analysis Descriptive and sum
mary data were produced and published using frequency
tables and figures A binary logistic regression model was
created to examine any connections between the indepen
dent variables and the outcome variable The fitness of the
model was assessed by Hosmer Lemeshow statistics and
Omnibus testing A multivariable analysis was used to iden
tify the real factors that affected the result variables To
determine whether there was any relationship between the
independent variables a multicollinearity test was carried
out using the standard error and colinearity statistics There
were no detectable collinearity effects With this in mind the
variance inflation factor V IF was To ascertain the
strength and direction of the statistical association the odds
ratio OR and confidence interval CI were utilized
At a p value it was determined that both the bivariate
and multivariate analyses were statistically significant

from the health center Three fourths of the respondents
had started their ANC services because of health
problems Nonetheless of the study s partici
pants lack confidence in medical professionals The survey
discovered that respondents had received health
education while getting ANC Regarding privacy more than
respondents stated that their privacy was not
respected during ANC visits Table
Moreover the focus group discussion FGD participants
strengthened the ideas provided above and one a year
old female focus group discussant expressed the diffculty of
maintaining privacy and confidentiality She stated that
the male doctor inserted his fingers into my vagina and
other nurses stood there looking at him Perhaps they were
in training I feel bad seeing that crowd staring at me
Because there were no curtains and no private room it was
diffcult to change my clothes and breastfeed the baby after
birth We can see each other and others visitors can easily
see us After the baby is born one bed for each woman
and private rooms or curtains around the bed to avoid seeing
other women would be more comfortable for all women
In a similar vein one participant in FGD said that
when I went to the hospital for an antenatal check up
there was a health care provider It was not what I had
hoped for before going to the hospital for service There was
no respectful healthcare provider The male doctors were
there to perform examinations The doctors pressed hard on
my tummy causing me pain
Thus from the above discussion we conclude that the
way the healthcare providers treat the woman plays a pivotal
role in keeping her on track with ANC
Furthermore one of the participants immensely com
plained about the waiting time in the ANC and said that
we are busy at home with our daily tasks and when we
go for ANC visits we are expected to stay at least an hour We
have a lot of daily activities that we do during this time As a
result we are clearly tired of waiting which leads us to aban
don follow up A year old woman

FIGURE The frequency of missed opportunity of ANC services
among reproductive age women in Eastern Ethiopia
sample size methods of assessment and the time gaps of the
study period Another possible explanation is that the study
population has lower access to information on maternal
healthcare services of which ANC is one of the vital compo
nents In contrast to this the findings from this study are rel
atively higher than those from studies conducted in different
settings such as Jimma Town The possible dif
ference may be due to the fact that East Ethiopia has a higher
level of ANC use which may be due to the fact that the area
was a cash crop area of Ethiopia and could have better
opportunities for information and better access to health
institutions than the other areas In addition seasonal vari
ability when the studies were conducted could explain the
observed difference among the findings
Findings from this study pointed out that the age of
women was a significant predictor of outcome variables
Thus women in the age range of were times
more likely to miss ANC opportunities than women in the
age range of and above This is consistent with the study
conducted in Kenya Malawi and Ghana It is crystal
clear that this cohort of the population is youth and adoles
cents Hence much has to be expected to enhance their con
cerns and complaints related to those of the ANC which in
turn plays a crucial role in reversing their absence from ANC
services Furthermore this is partially explained by the fact
that women in age groups above were more adapted to
and integrated into the services than their counterparts
The results of our research demonstrate that ANC
services were used more frequently as maternal education
levels increased This result is conceivable because increased
education will give women a greater understanding of and
awareness of ANC services Furthermore self independence
confident decision making and capability for managing
household and health all increased with better educational
levels Findings show that respondents who were
unable to read and write in elementary and secondary
education were and more likely to miss
ANC service than those who had college and above The odds
of missing an antenatal care service were reduced when educa
tional status increased This finding was supported by previous
research in Southern Ethiopia Northwest Ethiopia
and Western Ethiopia a systematic review conducted
in Ethiopia and EDS carried out in rural Ethiopia
Kenya Guinea Afghanistan Angola
Journal of Pregnancy
East African countries India Nepal
and Nigeria Educated women might be empowered to
get services and education makes women have
decision making skills On top of this educated
women have knowledge of danger signs Educated
women might be aware of the advantages of antenatal care ser
vices provided at the service delivery points for the fetus and
themselves Moreover this may be linked to the
fact that more educated women are aware of the advantages
of using ANC which enhances maternal and fetal health
through early detection of issues connected to pregnancy
and the receipt of different preventative and health promotion
services Also educated women can have access to media out
lets that promote the importance of prompt ANC commence
ment and healthcare facilities that offer the treatment
Contrary to these illiterate women could not fully appreciate
the value of ANC services for the health and safety of their
unborn fetus because of the lack of knowledge about the pros
and cons of ANC
The likelihood of utilization of ANC services among
women who had five or more births was less likely to
be missed compared to women who had one birth This
study is supported by studies conducted in Eastern Ethiopia
and elsewhere in Cambodia One explanation for
this could be that first time mothers are more likely than
second or third time mothers to be afraid of getting preg
nant and want to deliver their babies in a hospital A
study showed that women perceive that the first pregnancy
could bring more risks than subsequent pregnancies and
they become less attentive when the number of pregnancies
exceeds a certain limit Furthermore women who had a
history of giving birth safely would feel they were healthy
and not intend to seek delivery services from health facilities
In addition evidence indicates that women who have
many children are less likely to give birth in a healthy insti
tution Therefore community health programs should
consider community awareness creation to improve institu
tional delivery among women with multipara
According to the WHO every expectant mother should go
to at least four antenatal care appointments and give birth
at a health facility with the assistance of a skilled healthcare
provider According to our study women who had three
ANC visits were less likely to miss ANC services than
who had only one ANC visit Our findings were consistent
with the research done in Eastern Hararghe However
it was less than the results of research carried out in the Tigray
Region and Dembecha District in Ethiopia as well as
in Nigeria The probable variations in the supply of high
quality healthcare services and limited access to transportation
could be the likely causes of the differences
This research showed that optimal ANC was better as
compared to the findings of previous studies done in
Nekmet Ethiopia and elsewhere in Kenya
The reason for this variation could be the
emphasis given by the government of Ethiopia to improve
maternal health service utilization considering that it is
one of the exempted services in Ethiopia
Furthermore this study pointed out that pregnant
women who came for ANC follow up in the fourth and

second trimesters were found to be important predictors of
outcome variables Thus pregnant women who came for
ANC follow up during the fourth and second trimesters
were and less likely to miss out on ANC services
as compared to their counterparts respectively Studies car
ried out in many contexts including Gonder Northwest
Ethiopia provide support for this study Addis Ababa
and Malawi The possible justification could be
the fact that pregnant women who came to ANC follow up
during the second and third trimesters may hugely
understand the benefit of ANC as they are subjected to the
thought that they missed plenty of benefits provided to preg
nant women This regression clearly enhances and tightens
the need to be actively involved in the services of the ANC
Furthermore because they joined this vital service late in
the pregnancy journey and after experiencing the vital bene
fits of ANC services they continue to use it
Finally in this study the source of information for ANC
services was found to be significantly associated with out
come variables Hence the study participants who heard
information from TV radio and relatives were and
less likely to use ANC services respectively This is
congruent with the results of EDHS conducted in
Amhara Holeta and Addis Ababa
Although a relative or a partner may be a trusted source of
information there is a chance of the dissemination of biased
information which in turn affects the utilization of antenatal
care Moreover nowadays people are fed up with main
stream media which leads them not to attend the media as
they think that the information disseminated through them
is not reliable
Practical Implications and Future
Research Direction
This investigation made it clear that some of those pregnant
women lost the chance to receive ANC Therefore people
who successfully and efficiently received concentrated ANC
visits profited considerably and immensely from the advice
and assistance of healthcare professionals working in the
setup More significantly it gave the women practical knowl
edge about birth preparation preparing for problems early
treatment and spotting concurrent issues We strongly urge
researchers to employ observational studies to ascertain the
impacts of the missed chance of ANC on the health of mothers
and their babies since we are only worried about the missed
opportunity of ANC rather than its result Furthermore
because the study was conducted at the community level
extrapolating results for those who worked in institutions
would be diffcult which in turn affected the external validity
of the study
Limitation
The limitation of this study is that it does not address the
qualitative aspects like the detailed reasons why mothers
missed their antenatal care follow up Therefore it is open
for researchers to conduct a qualitative study on why women
missed their subsequent antenatal care follow up
Conclusions
This study pointed out that relatively high proportions of
pregnant women experienced missed opportunities in ante
natal care follow up Factors such as those who are women
in the age range of years unable to read and write
elementary and secondary education status those who have
one parity those who have three round visits being in the
first and second trimesters those who heard information
Journal of Pregnancy
from a health care provider and TBA were identified as pre
dictors of ANC utilization Therefore in order to enhance
the uptake of four full visits health policy implementers
need to coordinate their tracking of pregnant women who
missed their antenatal care session

Artificial intelligence gives pregnant women another avenue for receiving
healthcare information With the advancement of information and
communication technology searching online for pregnancy information has
become commonplace during COVID This study aimed to explore
pregnant women s information seeking behavior based on data mining and
text analysis in China Posts on maternal and infant related websites were
collected during June and January A total of valid posts
were obtained Based on the data we performed correlation analysis topic
analysis and sentiment analysis The correlation analysis showed the positive
effects of population population with a college education or above and GDP
on post counts The topic analysis extracted six nineteen eighteen thirteen
eleven sixteen thirteen sixteen nineteen and fourteen topics in different
months of pregnancy reflecting different information needs in various
pregnancy periods The results of sentiment analysis show that a peak of the
posts emerged in the second month of pregnancy and the proportion of
emotionally positive posts reached its peak in the sixth month of pregnancy
The study provides important insights for understanding pregnant women s
information seeking behavior

Introduction
Artificial intelligence creates opportunities for enabling pregnant women to
receive healthcare information Pregnancy is a crucial period in a woman s life
accompanied by physical change psychological change and role transformation
Information seeking can play an important role in addressing the issue of a healthy
delivery Access to advantageous and concerned information contributes to health related
decisions and the life of both pregnant women and unborn children Kamali et al
Childbirth related information is considerable for performing beneficial interventions
and suggestions for pregnant women Kamali et al For example health related
information will enable women to prepare for pregnancy concentrate on balanced
nutrition and medication use during pregnancy and make decisions on exercise
intensity and mode
frontiersin org
Hou and Hou
Extant research on health information has addressed the
crucial role of research contexts such as the user group and
the domain of information subject in determining
information needs Pian et al Reifegerste et al
The development of information technology and the
spread of the mobile Internet enable pregnant women to seek
information in a more conveniently and fairly way Centered
on the information needs of maternal health recent studies
have shown that pregnant women s information seeking
behavior is crucial to enriching the knowledge of
childbirth and maternal health and improving maternal
health outcomes Kamali et al Ahmadian et al
Jin et al Kassim For example Kamali
et al found that pregnant women need information
such as psychological and physical complications after
delivery and pregnancy nutrition in the descriptive study
The qualitative study conducted by Kassim found that
the unavailability of health facilities and limited chances of
accessing professional health care could lead to the results
that pregnant women seek information from non
professional and informal sources Ahmadian et al
identified commonly searched topics during pregnancy using
the questionnaire However researchers have not treated the
topics of information seeking and pregnant women s
emotions in much detail by employing a relatively large
amount of data
The objective of this research is to explore pregnant women s
information seeking behavior during the whole pregnancy
including the factors that contribute to the information
seeking behavior the topics that cause pregnant women s
attention at different months of pregnancy and the change in
pregnant women s emotions at different stages of pregnancy By
collecting and analyzing the posts in the pregnant section
under Mama cn from June to January and
valid posts the current work provides a comprehensive
study
Materials and methods
Data collection
With the advancement of Internet technology pregnant
women s behavior of seeking online health information has
become a universal trend worldwide because of insufficient
information received from healthcare providers and the
natural advantage of the Internet to ask questions
anonymously Dahshan et al As one of the
largest maternal and child health websites in China
Mama cn has integrated websites APPS new media

Mama cn
had
In August
million active users The number of active users of
Mama cn reached million in June ranking first
in the parenting subdivision list in China Therefore
Mama cn was selected as the research data source for this
study This study collected the posts in the pregnant section
under Mama cn from June to January
involving data from the first month of pregnancy to the
tenth month of pregnancy The current study extracted the
following information from the pregnant section under
Mama cn posts username post time duration of
pregnancy city and text A total of posts were
obtained Examples of our dataset are presented in Table l
We pre processed the original data before formal analysis by
the following procedures First the raw information may include
missing city tags irrelevant advertising messages or posts that
did not match the actual time of pregnancy We filtrated and
deleted the above data and finally obtained texts
Second the original message may contain distracting
information such as interpunction emoticons blank and
hashtags For excluding data noise and improving data
analysis efficiency we employed regular expressions
operations in Python for text filtering
Measures were performed to ensure data privacy
anonymity and security The data collection and analysis
did not disclose any privacy issues regarding pregnant
women s identifiable and sensitive information Favaretto
et al During data collection only username post
time duration of pregnancy city and text were extracted In
data processing and analysis only the duration of pregnancy
city and text data was used while the personal information of
users was not disclosed By involving as many samples as
possible more anonymity was preserved as a combination of
the variables will be repeated among the samples Leon Sanz
Methods
Text topic analysis based on latent
Dirichlet allocation model
LDA Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model is a topic
probability distribution model based on PLSI Probabilistic
Latent Semantic Indexing model Blei et al The LDA
topic model simulates the process of document generation by
using an implied random variable that follows a Dirichlet
distribution to represent the document s topic mixing ratio

The process of topic extraction
Its model structure is more complete and clearer and the
probability inference algorithm is adopted to process the text
which can greatly reduce the dimension of the text
representation to avoid dimension disaster Blei
Therefore LDA is widely used in text mining text
clustering language processing and other aspects The topic
number K contained in the document set is a hyperparameter
Given other hyperparameters the selection process of topic
number K is the process of the model searching for the optimal
topic number When the number of topics is too large there
will be many topics without obvious classification semantic
information When the number of topics is too small broad
topics will be generated with a mixture of two or more
distributions
Panichella
Therefore the
determination of the optimal number of topics is an
important issue A coherence score was used to determine
the optimal number of topics with a higher coherence score
indicating better quality of topics et al
Panichella Shah et al This study used the
open source LDA tool in the Gensim library The LDA
model was evaluated by topic coherence to determine the
optimal number of topics According to the trained LDA
model the topic words under each topic were obtained and
Frontiers in Physiology
the probability of each text belonging to each topic could be
directly predicted Finally the corresponding topic name was
summarized in accordance with the topic words Figure

Text sentiment analysis based on SnowNLP
In recent years there has been an increasing interest in
sentiment analysis Wang et al Sentiment analysis
also known as opinion mining is an application of text
mining and computational linguistics to mine subjective texts
with emotional colors and identify the emotional tendencies
contained in them It is a process of identifying information
from texts and analyzing processing induction and reasoning
subjective texts with emotional color Through sentiment
analysis researchers
can determine users
emotional
orientation in the text Text based sentiment analysis methods
are mainly divided into three types sentiment dictionary based
machine learning based and deep learning based Xu et al
Li et al The machine learning based analysis
method trains the emotion classifier with emotion labeled
data to achieve emotion classification Classification accuracy
relies on high quality human annotated training sets and large

the results of human subjective data annotation will also affect
the classification effect The deep learning based analysis is based
on feature self learning and deep neural network It has a good
classification effect when dealing with high dimensional
unlabeled big data but it is difficult to accurately classify the
semantically ambiguous and short text content in social
networks The sentiment dictionary based method is an
unsupervised method which uses a sentiment dictionary to
discriminate the sentiment polarity of text containing
keywords to achieve sentiment classification for each text
There is no need for complex data labeling in the research
process and the accuracy of emotion recognition can be
improved by adjusting and expanding the vocabulary of the
sentiment dictionary according to the specific research
background
SnowNLP a Python library for Chinese natural language
processing is used to analyze the sentiment of texts The tool is
based on a sentiment dictionary to analyze the sentiment
orientation of texts SnowNLP employs a sentiment dictionary
to realize the sentiment tendency analysis of the text The main
functions include part of speech tagging sentiment analysis

The closer the value is to the more positive the emotion the
closer the value is to O the more negative the emotion Figure
presents the posts with a sentiment value greater than in each
pregnancy month
By combining the outcomes of topic analysis and sentiment
analysis the results show that in the first month of pregnancy the
number of posts is relatively small mainly focusing on topics
such as test strip and pregnancy tests consultation and the
proportion of emotionally positive posts is also relatively low On
the one hand many pregnant women have not found out that
they are pregnant in the first month of pregnancy on the other
hand the first month of pregnancy is often unstable and at a loss
for pregnant women so their emotions are relatively negative
The number of posts in the second month of pregnancy is the
most but the proportion of posts with positive emotions is also
relatively low In the second month of pregnancy most pregnant
women have already guessed or confirmed pregnancy but new
pregnant women have little knowledge about pregnancy
Therefore posts about precautions for early pregnancy
early pregnancy inspection symptoms of early pregnancy
and other related early pregnancy topics surged However due to
the uncertainty of the baby s status and the lack of relevant
knowledge of pregnant women the proportion of emotionally
positive posts in the second month of pregnancy is relatively low
Frontiers in Physiology
After the first months of relevant inspections and
understanding of pregnancy knowledge pregnant women have
entered a relatively mature stage At the same time the status of
the baby gradually stabilized so the number of posts from the
second month of pregnancy to the third month dropped
significantly and it continued to be stable until the ninth of
pregnancy
The proportion of emotionally positive posts from the third
month to the ninth month of pregnancy is higher than that in
other months and there is an upward trend from the third month
to the sixth month of pregnancy The proportion is the highest in
the sixth month of pregnancy and then gradually decreases After
the third month of pregnancy the baby s state gradually stabilizes
the pregnant women s belly gradually bulges and the pregnant
women can even feel the baby s fetal movement but there is
generally no obvious physical discomfort so the pregnant women s
emotions are relatively more positive Since the seventh month of
pregnancy the baby s weight increases the pregnant women s
belly increases the body gradually becomes clumsy and the body
also has various discomforts such as soreness and difficulty
sleeping so pregnant women show more negative emotions
The number of posts in the tenth month of pregnancy surged
again second only to the second month of pregnancy and the
proportion of emotionally positive posts also dropped sharply
only higher than in the first of pregnancy The tenth month of
pregnancy is the month when the baby is about to be born On
the one hand the pregnant women s body aches and sleep

Hou and Hou
problems are more prominent On the other hand pregnant
women are faced with the uncertainty of childbirth and a state of
fear and anxiety appears It can also be seen from the results of
the topic analysis that in the current month appeals and desire
ranked first among the topics that pregnant women paid
attention to accounting for In addition expected
date of confinement and pregnant women s physical
discomfort are also the main contents of concern for
pregnant women
Discussion and conclusion
Summary of findings
The purpose of the current study was to investigate pregnant
women s information seeking behavior By a combination of
descriptive analysis topic analysis and sentiment analysis the
current work expands our knowledge by proving important
findings The correlation analysis showed that more pregnant
women contribute to more posts Moreover pregnant women
with a college education or above are more likely to seek
information about pregnancy on internet platforms The more
economically developed cities have higher Internet usage
Therefore pregnant women will be more probable to use
Internet platforms to seek information
Furthermore the topics from the first month to the tenth
month of pregnancy were extracted in topic analysis The
findings show that the topics in different months of
pregnancy relate to the present stages of pregnancy The
current paper identified six nineteen eighteen thirteen
eleven sixteen thirteen sixteen nineteen and fourteen topics
in different months of pregnancy The specific topics in different
stages show the changes in pregnant women s attention
In addition the sentiment analysis showed the variation of
pregnant women s emotions in information seeking The results
of sentiment analysis show a peak of the posts in the second
month of pregnancy The proportion of emotionally positive
posts reached its peak in the sixth month of pregnancy Pregnant
women s emotional sentiment deeply interacts with the results of
topic analysis
Practical and theoretical implications
Our study presents theoretical and practical significance
First this is one of the first studies to understand pregnant
women s information seeking using the methods of data mining
and text analysis Previous studies on the information needs of
maternal health revealed the topics that pregnant women pay
attention to however the existing work is limited in the
descriptive analysis and self reported questionnaire data
Kamali et al Ahmadian et al Jin et al
Frontiers in Physiology
fphys
Kassim This study is unique by employing enormous
quantities of data and the research data covers a long period By
visualizing the posts of every province the geographical
distribution of pregnant women s posts was clearly displayed
The current study enriches our understanding of the
relationships among pregnant women s information seeking
regional economic development level and educational level
Second this study provides comprehensive research
involving abundant analysis Compared with previous research
Kamali et al the current work divides the data from the
first month of pregnancy to the tenth month of pregnancy and
analyzes the large amounts of data according to the pregnancy
period This study provides important insights for understanding
the change of emotions during different pregnant stages and
connecting the changes of emotions with the topics that cause
pregnant women s attention The current work provides the
perspectives for future research by the subdivision of data in
different pregnant stages
Third the findings of this study have several practical
implications The findings indicate that pregnant women pay
attention to different topics during various months of pregnancy
The maternal and infant related websites should provide
customized information recommendations for pregnant
women according to their stages of pregnancy For example
information such as precautions and inspection for early
pregnancy should be recommended for pregnant women in
the second month of pregnancy Moreover the proportion of
emotionally positive posts reached its peak in the sixth month of
pregnancy and is relatively low in the first and the tenth of
pregnancy The relevant government management departments
and hospitals should concern about anxiety during early
pregnancy and before delivery The popularization of
knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth would be useful
for improving pregnant women s emotions
Limitations and future research
The study is subject to several inevitable limitations First the
data source of this study is Mama cn mainly located in China
What is now needed in the future is a cross national study
involving data for countries at different levels of development
The present study lays the groundwork for future research into
pregnant women s information seeking behavior around the
world Future studies are encouraged to improve the
generalizability of the current work by involving data from
different countries and understanding the role of cultural
identity in determining pregnant women s information
seeking Second the data such as personal attributes and
specific family environments are not included in the paper
since such data cannot be obtained from the website It would
be interesting to investigate the effect of family related variables
on pregnant women s emotional sentiment in future work

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Women receive many public health messages relating to pregnancy which are intended
to improve outcomes for babies and mothers However negotiating the risk landscape and maternity
care system can feel confusing and disempowering Relationships between women and their healthcare
providers are paramount but they can be adversely affected by issues of trust and autonomy
Methods We used a nested study design including an online survey and qualitative interviews to gain
an understanding of women s experiences of risk messages during pregnancy We purposively sampled
survey participants to ensure the interview population included women whose voices are seldom heard
and are disproportionately impacted by poor risk communication
Results A total of women responded to the survey and women participated in interviews Par
ticipants received public health and risk messages from a range of sources Data showed that women
wanted a balance between a better safe than sorry approach and evidence based information and ad
vice Women reported a discrepancy between the topics they received a lot of information on and areas
in which they felt they needed more advice Many participants said they were given conflicting advice
and the way information was delivered sometimes challenged their autonomy We identified that younger
women years old and women with higher BMIs experienced stigmatisation in their maternity care
Conclusions Our research shows the importance of risk communication that respects women s auton
omy and trusts them to make decisions about their own pregnancy We identified a need for a layered
approach to risk communication Whilst some women are happy to adopt precautionary behaviour with
out discussion others will want a thorough examination of the evidence base Our findings suggest that
more individualised care continuity and less judgement and stigmatisation from HCPS will improve ex
periences for women and may lead to better engagement with services

Public health messages or messages about risk regarding be
haviours during pregnancy form one aspect of a laudable agenda
to improve pregnancy outcomes and give babies a better start in
life during the first days First days of life
These messages are based on an understanding that information
and clear direction will lead expectant parents primarily moth
ers to make decisions that reduce the risk to the pregnancy and
of their babies experiencing short and longer term adverse health
outcomes

Pregnancy is often characterised as a teachable moment dur
ing which women are receptive to the provision of public health
messages and interventions Antenatal care Atkinson et al
One consequence is that women before and during preg
nancy are subjected to a wide range of messages about how to
reduce or manage a multitude of risks As part of routine ante
natal care midwives are expected to provide information on diet
smoking and substance misuse weight management emotional
and mental health exercise pre existing medical conditions foetal
movements and pregnancy related symptoms all in addition to
providing clinical monitoring of the woman and her pregnancy
Sanders et al Family members friends and parenting ex
perts also contribute their own sometimes contradictory opinions
and experiences New study findings introduce an increasing range
of risks and benefits
from avoiding air pollution Smith et al
to eating more broccoli Li et al These findings are

R Blaylock H Trickey J Sanders et al
reported in press statements and media headlines which do not
always fully reflect the nuances of results which may create alarm
or additional pressure for women and the people who care for
them Marshall et al
The volume and intensity of instruction may be leading to un
intended negative effects
including excessive maternal anxiety
Rowe and Fisher and a failure to deliver personalised care
that addresses individuals concerns Sanders et al Further
more risks may not always be communicated in a way that reflects
or explains the limitations of the evidence base Sharp et al
Elements of current pregnancy related public health advice
have been challenged on the basis that they are insuffciently
nuanced For example research which sought women s experi
ences of the UK Governments guidance to abstain from drink
ing alcohol in pregnancy raised concerns about the communica
tion of the precautionary principle the better safe than sorry ap
proach
Communicating public health alcohol guidance for expec
tant mothers Other concerns highlighted were the risk of
irresolvable anxiety amongst women who had drunk alcohol be
fore they knew they were pregnant and the encouragement of so
Cial surveillance of women s decisions Alarm has also been raised
about the extension of pregnancy risk messaging to all women
of childbearing age including the recent World Health Organiza
tion draft recommendation that all women with childbearing po
tential abstain from drinking alcohol Global alcohol action plan
Some suggest that the current risk messaging context may
be driving a wider culture of parenting that tends to hold mothers
responsible for any and all ills that befall their children Lee and
Bristow In some countries such as the USA mothers are
held maximally responsible and sometimes imprisoned for be
haviours that may harm the foetus in utero such as taking illegal
and even prescription drugs Negpor and
We anticipated that the challenges in negotiating risk messages
disproportionately affect women who have pre existing or preg
nancy complications or who are more vulnerable in other ways
Women who are taking medications have higher BMIs older
or younger than the contemporaneous mean or those living in
poverty can all find themselves under pressure to change their
behaviour whilst also finding risks more diffcult to avoid Moth
ers themselves and those responsible for their care sometimes
struggle to balance maternal need for pharmacological treatments
with limiting foetal exposure to potentially teratogenic medica
tions
Lawthom The MBBRACE UK inquiries have identified
advice to pregnant women to discontinue antidepressants as a con
tributory factor in maternal suicide and there are concerns that
restrictions on sodium valproate use amongst women of reproduc
tive age may result in the deaths of pregnant women with epilepsy
Knight et al A failure to prioritise maternal health can also
have grave impacts for a woman s foetus New research suggests
that of women with Hyperemesis Gravidarum who did not re
ceive appropriate treatment had an abortion and over half consid
ered terminating otherwise wanted pregnancies Nana et al
We aimed to gain an in depth understanding of women s lived
experiences of pregnancy related risk messages and public health
advice across a wide range of topics and issues
Aims
To describe women s lived experiences of risk communication
relating to pregnancy in the United Kingdom and how this
varies for
a women with higher BMIs kg
b women who make decisions relating to medications includ
ing for Hyperemesis Gravidarum and for depression or anx
iety

To explore how women experience risk communication in
terms of prioritising foetal and maternal health
To explore how women experience the communication of un
certainty and the precautionary principle as part of risk mes
saging
Methods
Study design
We used a mixed methods nested design consisting of an on
line survey and in depth interviews with a sub sample of survey
respondents
Study population
The study population consisted of women who were pregnant
or who had been pregnant in the last five years This included
women whose pregnancy ended in a live birth miscarriage still
birth or termination of pregnancy
Inclusion criteria
Women aged years old
Women who were or had been pregnant within the last years
Women who were living in the United Kingdom
Exclusion criteria
Women with insuffcient English to participate in the online
survey or interviews
The survey and interviews were inclusive of all people who had
been pregnant in the last five years We use the word women col
lectively throughout this paper as that is how most participants
self identify but refer to individuals using their self described gen
der We use the term BAME but acknowledge that this is prob
lematic and present our data on ethnicity in more granular and
specific terms in

Table
Data collection
Survey
The online survey was developed in collaboration with the
project advisory group A pilot of the survey allowed the re
search team to draw on feedback from users and test dissemina
tion strategies
A participant information sheet and consent form were inte
grated into the survey The survey included questions on partici
pants experience of the advice information and support they re
ceived from different sources during pregnancy with the focus on
the respondent s most recent pregnancy Questions with open free
text responses were included alongside questions with Likert scales
and multiple choice responses Data on sociodemographic charac
teristics were collected We also asked survey participants whether
they would be prepared to be contacted for a future one to one in
terview
The survey was hosted on SurveyMonkey Surveymonkey
took approximately min to complete and was open
between June and August There were questions in
total although the final questions were focused on participation
in future research including the interviews Data generated by the
other questions are presented in the results section
The survey was disseminated through Facebook s inbuilt adver

We acknowledge the term BAME is problematic and present our data on ethnicity in more granular and
specific terms in this table The Power of Language

gender identity Other gender identities included non binary and gender fluid

which allowed for snowball sampling Johnson
One to one interviews
To gain an in depth understanding of women s experiences we
also conducted interviews A sampling frame was designed to en
sure of the interview sample were eligible for means tested
State benefits at least of the sample were from Black Asian
and Minority Ethnic BAME backgrounds and included at least six
women with experience of pregnancy advice in relation to
having a higher BMI
medications for mental health conditions
medications for Hyperemesis Gravidarum
being a younger mother aged at the time of their preg

having a termination due to a perceived or actual risk either to
themselves or their foetus baby
Some participants fell into more than one of these categories
Survey participants that met the sampling criteria were selected
to be contacted using a random number table until the required
numbers were obtained
The participant information sheets PIS consent forms and
topic guides for the interviews were developed in collaboration
with the project advisory group Several topic guides were tailored
to ensure they were suitable for participants who experienced dif
ferent pregnancy outcomes e g stillbirth live birth termination
Narrative topic guides allowed participants to tell their pregnancy
stories in chronological order Participants were asked to discuss
their most recent pregnancy however many also drew on their
wider experiences of pregnancy and parenthood
Interviews including pilot interviews were carried out by two
experienced female members of the research team RB and HT
between April and November of Interviews lasted approx
imately min Participants were offered the option of in
person or telephone interviews Two pilot interviews were con
ducted in person and were deemed to be of a high enough quality
to be included in the analysis All subsequent interviews were con
ducted by telephone and recorded using a dictaphone Participants

Sources of information and advice
Participants received information about how to have a healthy
pregnancy from a range of sources In addition to their healthcare
providers HCPs women sought out or received information from
social media the mainstream media family and friends often with
contradictory messages
Media
Several participants reflected on the emotional impact of read
ing scaremongering stories in the traditional media One woman
described how she had read an article about avoiding carrying
heavy items during pregnancy and subsequently believed she had
experienced a miscarriage because she had carried a car seat up a
flight of stairs
I remember reading somewhere you shouldn t be carrying heavy
loads and things this that and the other l think I was moving
my daughter s car seat from my car and I carried it up a flight
of stairs and then literally I think a day or two later that s when
I had the miscarriage I m thinking maybe it was because of that
that s why it happened
Whilst many participants described panicking about every
thing feeling stressed and helpless many also
recognised that warnings about avoiding risks during pregnancy
were not achievable and you ve got to take it all
with a pinch of salt

Social media
The majority of interview participants spoke about social me
dia being a source of helpful information and advice and many
had positive experiences of due date Facebook groups Simi
larly participants who had conditions such as Hyperemesis Gravi
darum found that social media provided peer support However
many also recognised that social media was rife with mislead
ing information and contradictory advice Participants who were
in transnational pregnancy support groups noted the contradiction
in pregnancy related advice across countries such as the number
of routine antenatal check ups offered to women
Family and friends
Participants were overwhelmingly positive about the support
provided to them by friends and their own mothers In addition to
providing practical support they offered advice and reassurance in
the face of an overwhelming landscape of pregnancy related risk
information as was the case with WRII who described how her
mum supported her when she was concerned about taking medi
cation prescribed for Hyperemesis Gravidarum
I think my mum was very supportive and saying like If the doc
tors have prescribed it it ll be fine and like you need it basi
cally WRII
Partners were described by a small number of participants as
being helpful and supportive However several participants ex
pressed that they felt pressure to consider their partner s feelings
when making decisions about their lifestyle during pregnancy One
woman described how her partner asked her to give up Coca Cola
When you ve got someone else in your life perhaps who s panick
ing and like Argh it s a little bit more pressure than you would
want You have to tell them to calm down and rein it in a little
bit Like It s going to be okay don t worry you know I m still
going to look after myself I m still going to look after this baby
Better safe than sorry
The survey data showed that women wanted a balance between
a better safe than sorry approach and evidence based informa
tion and advice Table The majority n either
strongly or tended to agree that when scientists cannot rule
out the possibility of harm pregnant women should take a better
safe than sorry approach and n
wanted straight
forward do or don t advice There were some scenarios in which
participants felt a particularly strong need to exercise caution and
adopt the precautionary principle including when making deci
R Blaylock H Trickey J Sanders et al
sions around the consumption of alcohol and use of prescription
medication
Because no one really knows what s a safe amount and what isn t
and they are saying now aren t they just don t bother drinking
anything because we don t know what is a safe amount I ve had
maybe three drinks during pregnancy and not even finished them
So god such a negligible amount It s been absolutely fine I ve
been alright with that I ve felt really good And I think I needed
that I ve just seen it as like a detox
Despite the support for the precautionary principle most sur
vey respondents n also wanted to have all the avail
able evidence in order to make their own decisions about their
pregnancy Survey free text responses and interview data showed
that this extended to situations where there was a paucity of evi
dence or uncertainty
A lot of standard advice seems to be based on a better safe than
sorry mindset especially as it s not always possible to conduct high
quality studies on pregnant women to generate robust evidence I
personally find it more useful to understand the evidence base and
use this to make informed decisions rather than be given a list of
rules to follow Every individual and every pregnancy is different
and a do don t approach fails to acknowledge this survey respon
dent
Some participants recognised that their own circumstances
made them more cautious about certain decisions and behaviours
This was particularly the case with women who had experienced a
previous pregnancy loss who exercised a greater deal of caution in
subsequent pregnancies
I put two and two together in that scenario and thought Yes
that s my fault
I can t change it I just think when it came
to my next pregnancy I changed my habits I really really toned
down my drinking especially in the run up to getting pregnant I
think I waited before I would have a glass of wine at weddings
and stuff like that I think I probably waited until I was well over
the weeks
Information gaps
In the interviews and survey women reported a discrepancy
between the topics they received a lot of information on and areas
in which they felt they needed more advice The following were
the top four topics that participants said were well explained
what to not to eat during pregnancy n
vaccina
tions during pregnancy for influenza and whooping cough
n smoking before and during pregnancy n
and drinking alcohol before and during pregnancy n
In contrast participants wanted more advice and information
on managing mental health and pregnancy n man
aging stress and pregnancy n
infections such as
Group B Streptococcus Toxoplasmosis and Cytomegalovirus
and infant feeding n Many participants
expressed that they received information that was not relevant to
them at the expense of other areas where they needed better sup
port
Although I didn t smoke or drink I received much better informa
tion on this than anything else I didn t receive any information on
maintaining good mental health during pregnancy and I feel this
contributed to me developing PND survey respondent
Furthermore participants described feeling unable to act on the
information about risk given to them This was particularly the
case with mental health conditions and risk factors which were
unmodifiable at the time of pregnancy such as age or weight
Midwifery
God I couldn t tell you which journal this paper came out in but
it was the study that looked at elevated cortisol in pregnant women
and behavioural issues in their children That really stuck with me
because it came out and I was the most stressed person I was so
stressed and I was trying to do things to de stress but life was just so
all over the place that nothing worked
Conflicting advice
Many participants said they were given conflicting advice by
HCPs on a range of issues including what to expect during labour
and birth diagnosis of pregnancy related conditions and the
safety of alcohol consumption during pregnancy A few women
also noted that advice at the policy level had changed over the
course of each of their pregnancies leading to confusion
I ve had four pregnancies in four years so one in
and every single time the differences in just the protocols the
way things have changed information and how you re given it Ev
ery single time it s been completely different
Several participants described conflicting messages from HCPS
about the safety of medication in pregnancy
As soon as she GPI saw that I was on medication for mental
health she was like So you re on antidepressants I said Yes
She went Well what are we going to do about that I was like
Well my midwife said it s fine the risk to my baby The risk to
myself if I came off them outweighed that and it s a very minimal
risk I was on a low dose She said It s not okay It s not okay
She was very sharp with me It s like as if I was taking hard drugs
her something her reaction was She wouldn t give me a prescrip
tion for Citalopram She said You need to go on Sertraline I said
I don t feel comfortable with changing meds at the moment It
took me a long time to find Citalopram and that really suits me
She was like But you can t breastfeed on Citalopram She was
assuming a lot of things because I wasn t planning on breastfeed
ing anyway I took the prescription from her for Sertraline and I
was crying after the appointment I went to the pharmacy think
ing I ll just do it Then the pharmacy were really funny with me
because I was getting Citalopram and Sertraline because I needed
to wean myself off Citalopram first to start the Sertraline That was
humiliating because it was in front of everybody
Such conflicting messages are not without consequences In ad
dition to the anxiety and distress caused contradictory messages
around the safety of medication can lead women to abstain from
taking prescribed medication out of fear of harming their baby
I am epileptic and though my seizures increased during pregnancy
I was too scared to tell my midwife as I was afraid of my medica
tion being increased and the risks to my unborn baby I ended up
being hospitalised during pregnancy because of my seizures and
my daughter had to be delivered early by caesarean section I be
lieve if I had been given more information about the medication
including risks and percentages that I wouldn t of been so scared
to increase my medication survey respondent
Challenges to autonomy
The way in which information about risk was delivered to
women sometimes challenged their autonomy and had negative
implications for their relationships with their HCPS Table
Many
women initially implicitly trusted their HCPs However partial or
inaccurate advice from HCPS was a source of anxiety for women
and sometimes led to poor care
I d asked several times Is there anything I can take for that
and she d said No there s nothing we can give you You just have

Several participants reflected that the use of carbon monoxide
testing undermined their relationship with midwives who they felt
were trying to catch out women who underreported their smok
ing levels
I always thought it s bizarre asking someone for their subjective
answer and then you are almost like Right well that means abso
lutely nothing because we need to do a test of the carbon monox
ide in your blood anyway I think that s rubbish really because
the relationship between midwife and mother is really really im
portant I think we should be making sure that s as strong as
possible throughout pregnancy l think testing strengthens that
power imbalance between clinician and patient
Several survey respondents also reported their data being
shared with third parties such as Slimming World which further
undermined trust between them and their midwife
Because of my weight high BMI I was offered an additional ser
vice about losing weight which I did not want I declined and it
still was pushed on me and she turned up to my appointment
without my consent survey respondent

midwife about my choices survey respondent
Stigmatised communication of risk
We identified that younger women years old and women
with higher BMIs had a distinct and stigmatised experience of ma
ternity care
Younger mothers
Women who became mothers under the age of had a dis
tinct experience of risk messaging and several described the ad
vice they received as instructional One woman explained that she
felt like if I didn t do something with my first baby especially
that they d take my baby off me or something One in
terview participant with four children said that the advice
she received during her pregnancies changed as she got older Dur
ing her first pregnancy she found the support from a health visi
tor to be useful but condescending In contrast during her later
pregnancies she found HCPS to be more respectful of her wishes
One woman WRIII suggested that family and friends compen
sated for a lack of information provided about labour and birth by
HCPs and was concerned that women even younger than herself
may find the paucity of advice and information scary sug
gested that all first time mothers should be treated the same re
gardless of their age
I think they should be treated like any other first time mum
because I bet there are odd year old mums out there that prob
ably know the same amount as an year old who s pregnant for
the first time If you ve not done it before you don t know
Another younger participant reflected on how partial advice left
them unprepared for the consequences of obstetric injuries
I wish I d known more about obviously tears and stuff
it
was the sort of situation where they said about it but they sort
of went Oh you re young you won t have to worry about that
sort of thing Third degree tears normally happen to older ladies
Women with higher BMIs
of survey respondents reported
Approximately n
feeling judged because of their weight and described dehumanisa
tion and depersonalisation within the maternity care system This
is exemplified by one woman who was present for conversations
about how staff would move her should she become incapacitated
in labour
I accept that there is also the risk of the idea of my body as an
object which is large Therefore in itself poses a risk to staff who
R Blaylock H Trickey J Sanders et al
are handling my body That is a very depersonalising way to think
about oneself I m aware that is something that has to be consid
ered but I feel quite strongly that risk needs to be considered in
private and not in front of me
Another described how her weight dominated every interaction
with HCPs leading her to feel like her pregnancy would not end
with a healthy baby
My weight dominated every conversation held with every single
medical professional and led me and my partner to be absolutely
convinced we wouldn t bring the baby to term We were told re
peatedly that the birth would be difficult I wouldn t cope and that
there would be complications I was told to have an epidural at
the first signs of labour as I would def need emergency interven
tion so it made sense to do it at the beginning as I wouldn t be
able to control myself enough once the labour had started to do
it later on I was almost convinced I wouldn t be bringing my
baby home and even didn t do things like put up a cot survey
respondent
Participants also described a failure to recognise efforts they
had made in the preconception period to mitigate against risk
I was overweight and many of my appointments seemed to fo
cus more on my weight than anything else despite the fact that I
proved I had lost more than stone in the months before falling
pregnant survey respondent
and a failure to contextualise risk
As I m overweight I felt very anxious all the way through the
pregnancy as I was constantly being told I was at a higher risk
but no one could tell me by how much It regularly made me feel
like I wasn t good enough to have a baby survey respondent
Discussion
Overall participants wanted a balance between a better safe
than sorry approach and evidence based information and advice
Whilst most women were happy to adopt the precautionary prin
ciple others wanted more detailed information relating to risk A
need for a well informed layered approach to information provi
Sion was evident to support honest discussions about risk includ
ing where there was uncertainty
Other research on pregnancy related COVID public health
messages found that women felt it was better to be safer than
sorry and over interpreted advice to stringently socially distance
shielding from the outside world Sanders and Blaylock
Reflecting the hesitancy amongst pregnant women to accept the
COVID vaccination Skirrow et al Blakeway et al
in this research we found that even when counselled on the im
portance of using medication by HCPs some women preferred not
to do so out of fear of harming their baby leaving them vulner
able to serious deterioration in their health Whilst the adoption
of the precautionary principle may be considered effective public
health messaging we found concerning examples that the precau
tionary approach enacted through self policing behaviours can lead
to negative outcomes for the woman herself We found that dif
ferent women had different appetites for risk and this was often
shaped by previous experiences Whilst cognisant of the fact that
there was unlikely to be a causative link between a behaviour such
as carrying something heavy or drinking a small amount of alco
hol and miscarriage some women having experienced miscarriage
felt that no avoidable risk was acceptable when it came to sub
sequent pregnancies However this was not universal and what
may have been a small or negligent risk to one person e g drink
ing a small amount of alcohol may have felt like a huge risk to
another
Midwifery
Women have different appetites for risk with their tolerance
often changing over time shaped by their own experiences In the
absence of any evidence of harm about a particular behaviour
they should be free to adopt or reject the precautionary princi
ple
McDonald et al However it becomes more challeng
ing where there is a known risk to the fetus such as in the pre
scribing of drugs with teratogenic effects such as Sodium Valproate
Valproate Pregnancy Prevention Programme Whilst being
well motivated formal healthcare guidelines that mandate a pre
cautionary approach undermine women s autonomy are stigma
tising and remove their ability to make decisions for themselves
Royal College of Midwives Lee et al Increasingly
women who make what others deem to be risky decisions are
seen as transgressive according to social norms which dictate what
an ideal mother should do
Kukla
Our participants explained that there was a mismatch between
the topics they received a lot of information on and areas in
which they felt they needed more advice and support For ex
ample smoking and drinking alcohol in pregnancy were identi
fied as topics which participants received a lot of information
In contrast participants wanted more advice on managing men
tal health conditions during pregnancy Some participants felt that
this over focus on certain topics caused them to experience bad
outcomes such as post natal depression Gaps in the information
provided to pregnant women and conflicting advice may leave
them to make their own decisions without any support With
out any guidance from healthcare professionals on issues such as
whether it is safe to take particular medications in pregnancy they
are left to the mercy of the sea in which they swim the prevail
ing cultural ideas about what is and is not appropriate behaviour
in pregnancy and the imperative to protect the foetus at all costs
even at their own expense Maternity Decisions Induction Survey
The attention given to some topics in public health messag
ing during pregnancy arguably reflects the research agenda and
accessibility of data There is a trend particularly within the De
velopmental Origins of Health and Disease DOHaD paradigm to
use large cohort studies to ascertain associations between mater
nal exposures and foetal outcomes There is an implicit assumption
about the causal primacy of maternal pregnancy effects and this
sets the agenda of DOHaD research which is reinforced and repro
duced rather than challenged Sharp et al Our research on
the reporting of pregnancy related studies found that the majority
of studies that were reported in the UK mainstream media frame
mothers rather than protective towards their unborn infants as
vectors of potential harm to their children who are the focus of
the health outcomes Marshall et al A recent report found
an imbalance between women s research priorities such as peri
natal mental health and research funding suggesting a realign
ment of research priorities with women s needs is urgently needed
Guthrie et al
The use of carbon monoxide testing to validate women s self
reported behaviours and referrals to additional support without
consent were described as undermining the relationship between
women and their midwives Others have also identified the use of
carbon monoxide testing in maternity care as having the poten
tial to do more harm than good Bowden By not trusting
women s self reports testing for carbon monoxide exposure leaves
women feeling judged and not trusted which could lead to disen
gagement with services and is at odds with shared decision mak
ing
O Brien et al We found that when they felt judged
women were more likely to lie or hide their behaviour which
is consistent with findings from other research on working class
mothers and smoking in Wales Grant et al
Women with higher BMIs and younger mothers reported rou
tine stigmatisation dehumanisation and a lack of kindness within
R Blaylock H Trickey J Sanders et al
maternity care Younger women described feeling they risked hav
ing their baby taken into care if they did not comply with instruc
tions To receive care under such a climate of fear hinders the for
mation of trusting relationships between women and their health
care providers Sanders et al McLeish and Redshaw
Furthermore around a quarter of women felt judged for their
weight As mentioned previously when women feel judged they
are less likely to engage in healthcare which can have ramifications
for maternal and foetal health
Women with higher BMIs described the distress caused by hav
ing to repeat their story multiple times and a failure to recog
nise the weight loss journey they may have been on prior to each
appointment meeting each new midwife Within expanding mid
wifery continuity of carer MCoC teams midwives should be able
to provide more individualised care
Some of our participants described being told they were at
risk or had a high risk pregnancy but not being told how much
greater their risk of a poor outcome was This was particularly
the case with risk factors which were unmodifiable at the time
of pregnancy such as having a high BMI or suffering from a pre
existing health condition This failure to contextualise risk derives
from how risk is calculated from population level epidemiological
studies and extrapolated and applied to the individual in a clinic
setting
WRISK
Pregnancy is often characterised as a teachable moment dur
ing which healthcare professionals can educate women and im
prove their health Atkinson et al This leads to a greater fo
cus on the individual determinants of health rather than the social
or structural determinants of health which require a longer lead
time and collective population level efforts to resolve This fo
cus on the individual determinants of public health is a departure
from current trends within public health more broadly which fo
cus on social determinants Acknowledging the diffculty in trying
to solve public health problems in a month window there is a
growing focus on improving women s health in the pre conception
period regardless of their pregnancy planning intentions Budds
Whilst we did not interview HCPs we identified that system
level constraints also contribute to the poor communication of
risk and public health messages The sheer volume of pub
lic health initiatives and information provided on a wide range
of topics means that antenatal care appointments can become
tick box exercises rather than tailoring the appointment to
meet a woman s individual needs Midwives are constrained
by short appointment times a lack of training and resources
Sanders et al which inevitably means that some infor
mation is prioritised This is compounded by serious staff short
ages NHS Again MCoC may contribute to more individ
ualised care but plans for universal implementation have been
delayed
Sandall et al Delivering Midwifery Continuity
These structural issues mean the quality of a woman s ante
natal experience is contingent on who they happen to see that
particular day how knowledgeable they are and whether they
have time to meet their individual needs This is evidenced by
our findings that a woman with Hyperemesis Gravidarum was
told by her midwife that there was no safe medication that
she could take More recently anecdotal evidence emerged of
pregnant women being turned away from COVID vaccination
centres or being told by their midwives that vaccination for
COVID is not safe in pregnancy contrary to the evidence
base
The Guardian Ultimately we are yet to decide who
gets to choose what is an acceptable risk to take in pregnancy
Women s and HCPs appetites for risk might be different and when
they are discordant this can lead to gatekeeping and conflicting
advice
Midwifery
Strengths and limitations
Our study included over women from across the UK
Our purposive sampling frame ensured our interview population
included higher proportions of ethnic minorities and women on
low incomes than at the UK population level ensuring the most
marginalised women were represented However the sampling
frame design may have shaped our findings and focused atten
tion on certain experiences of risk communication at the expense
of others for example the stigmatisation of women with higher
BMIs
Our survey was self selecting and may reflect the views of
those more motivated to participate in research Given the survey
was hosted online we are mindful that it excluded those with
out access to the internet Furthermore our survey and interviews
were restricted to those who could speak English and therefore ex
cluded non English speakers who are likely to have more diffcul
ties accessing and navigating the maternity care system in the UK
Conclusion
Our research shows the importance of risk communication that
respects women s autonomy and trusts them to make decisions
about their own pregnancy Our findings support principles which
have been previously identified in aiding high quality risk com
munication and we recommend that HCPs involved in delivering
risk messages familiarise themselves with these Freeman
We identified a need for a layered approach to risk communica
tion Whilst some women are happy to adopt precautionary be
haviour without discussion others will want a thorough exami
nation of the evidence base and its limitations Our findings sug
gest that more individualised care continuity and less judgement
and stigmatisation from HCPS will improve experiences for women
and may lead to better engagement with services A realignment
of research priorities with women s own needs will likely lead
to improved evidence to support their care Ultimately our re
search demonstrates that women want what is best for their preg
nancy and children Women should be well informed and then
trusted and supported to make decisions based on their own
circumstances

BACKGROUND Current guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in preg
nancy include the use of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
with either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or a ritonavir boosted pro
tease inhibitor although there is no designation of which is the preferred
option
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare viral suppression at delivery
among patients on dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors com
bined with either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or a protease inhibi
tor A hypothesis was made that the incidence of viral suppression is
higher with the use of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
backbone combined with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor than with
the use of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone
combined with a protease inhibitor
STUDY DESIGN This study was an obsetwational study of pregnant
patients living with HIV who received prenatal care and delivered after
weeks of gestation at an urban safety net hospital All pregnant patients
with HIV were referred to a centralized clinic for HIV counseling medica

or initiated according to protocols based on national guidance Among
patients on a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone
combined with integrase strand transfer inhibitor vs protease inhibitor at
delivery we compared the demographics and HIV disease characteristics
including year of diagnosis viral load and antiretroviral therapy class The
outcome of interest was viral suppression at delivery defined as a viral
RESULTS From January to December patients on
dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor met the inclusion criteria
including patients on protease inhibitor and patients
on integrase strand transfer inhibitor at delivery Demographic dis
tribution was similar and prenatal care was initiated at weeks of gesta

Key findings
Pregnant individuals living with HIV on a dual NRT I backbone regimen that
included an INSTI achieved viral suppression at delivery with greater frequency

Comment
Principal findings
In this year cohort of pregnant
patients with HIV who delivered at our
institution complete viral suppression
at delivery was associated with an
INST I based combined ART regimen
instead of a PI based combined ART
regimen Among patients who did have
viremia at delivery there was no differ
ence in viral load among patients on an
INST I based regimen vs among patients
on a P I based regimen in a cohort with
viral load representing the main objec
tive marker of adherence Over time
during the study period the use of
INSTI increased whereas the use of PI
decreased likely reflecting evolving clin
ical guidelines and increasing safety and
efficacy data for INSTI in individuals of
childbearing age and pregnancy More
over we theorize that this trend demon
strates indirect evidence of improved
patient adherence and patient and pro
vider preference over a decade

In our large referral center our practice
is to continue virologically suppressive
regimens in pregnant patients who report
adherence with frequent viral monitoring
Moreover these patients were included in
the INSTI cohort In our experience a
once daily complete regimen with low
pill burden and few side effects is ideal
for adherence and leads to successful viral
suppression at delivery Over the past
decade vertical transmission of HIV has
become extremely rare with the transition
to an INSTI based dual NRTI regimen in
our patient population
Results in the context of what is
known
Safety and efficacy of INSTI in preg
nancy is further supported by a multi

among the regimens studied In addi
tion this is consistent with the results
published by Rahangdale et al which
suggested more rapid viral suppression

Our findings differed from prospec
tive cohort study that showed no differ
ence in undetectable viral load among
pregnant patients near delivery on an
INST I based regimen compared with a
P I based regimen However the authors
found that patients in the INSTI group
demonstrated a lower median viral load
and a greater viral load reduction near
delivery Most patients on an INSTI
based regimen in that study were on ral
tegravir as opposed to dolutegravir and
this may explain the lack of statistical
difference in viral load at delivery
However acceptance and preference
for INSTI during pregnancy have not
been without challenges An interim
analysis of a birth outcomes surveillance
study in Botswana released online in
published in by Zash et al
highlighted a slightly higher prevalence
of neural tube defects in patients taking
dolutegravir at conception with per
deliveries compared with per
deliveries in patients taking other
types of ART at conception The result
ing transition away from the use of
INSTI was swift among infectious dis
ease providers caring for individuals
with childbearing potential and this
effect is suggested by a dip in INSTI use
reflected in pregnant patients in
Figure However the final analysis
of the data published by Zash et al in
demonstrated that this difference
was not statistically significant and that
the trend in INSTI use again increased
in our cohort after
Clinical implications
In the absence of a randomized controlled
trial to determine superiority between
INSTIs and PIs in pregnancy we demon
strate superior viral suppression at delivery
with INSTI vs PI based regimens over a
decade of treating underserved patients liv
ing with HIV The results of our study may
help clinicians considering regimens for
ART nai e pregnant patients or for their
patients who have not achieved complete
viral suppression on a given regimen We
now prescribe dolutegravir with dual
NRTI backbone as a first line treatment
for all patients initiating ART in pregnancy
regardless of trimester

Background Pregnancy risk perception affects a pregnant woman s decision about health care services such as prenatal care
place of birth choices about medical interventions adherence to medical procedures and recommendations Therefore the
study is aimed at assessing pregnancy risk perception and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal
care at health centers in Jabi Tehnan District Methods An institutional based cross sectional study was conducted among
mothers attending ANC at health centers in the Jabi Tehnan District from April to Data was collected
through a face to face interview using a structured questionnaire which was developed according to the health belief
model The logistic regression model was used using an adjusted odds ratio with CI and pvalue to declare
significance and associations Result Four hundred twenty four pregnant women were interviewed of which nearly
half of the respondents had good pregnancy risk perception Women who had a history of obstetric
complications AOR CI those who knew at least one pregnancy danger sign AOR CI
pregnant women who had a bad obstetric history AOR CI and knowing women who
died due to pregnancy related complications AOR were more likely to have good perception
towards pregnancy risk compared to their counterparts Conclusion Obstetric complications awareness of pregnancy danger
signs bad obstetric history and known women who died due to pregnancy related complications were found to be
significantly associated with pregnancy risk perception
Background
Risk perception means an individual s expectation about the
probability characteristics and severity of an event and it is
an important construction for different health behavior theories
such as the health belief model protection motivation theory
and prospect theory An individual making a judgment
about the probability of an event is based on experience
A greater perception of health risks leads to conducting
protective action Therefore it is important to understand
the perception of health risks of pregnancy and the accuracy
of those perceptions Pregnancy risk perception affects a
pregnant woman s decision about health care services like
prenatal care place of birth choices about medical interven
tions adherence to medical procedures and recommenda
tions and health behaviors
Pregnancy is a normal physiological process but some
of the common discomforts of pregnancy may make the
pregnant woman feel ill Ranging from mildly irritating to
life threatening conditions pregnancy and childbirth
are often perceived as normal life events without justifica
tion in many developing countries including Ethiopia
Obstetric complications are high among normal pregnan
cies These complications occurred following warning signs
called obstetric danger signs
The top commonly manifested danger signs during
labor and childbirth are severe vaginal bleeding prolonged
labor convulsions and retained placenta Besides danger
ous signs might occur during the postnatal period which
include severe vaginal bleeding unconsciousness and fever
Every pregnant woman is at risk of facing
pregnancy related complications that could end in death
or injury to both herself and the newborn From
pregnancy related complications hemorrhage obstructed
labor pregnancy induced hypertension puerperal sepsis
and unsafe abortion are the five leading causes of maternal
death in Ethiopia from to Early detection and
management of those complications are important to
reduce maternal mortality
Pregnancy and childbirth complications are major causes
of maternal death Complications that develop during
pregnancy account for of maternal deaths are called
direct causes of maternal death Globally the magnitudes
of direct cause s maternal death are hemorrhage
pregnancy induced hypertension puerperal sepsis
and unsafe abortion In Ethiopia hemor
rhage obstructed labor pregnancy
induced hypertension puerperal sepsis
and unsafe abortion are major causes of maternal
death
Due to obstetric complications globally every day
women died The developing countries accounted for
of these deaths Of these eighty six percent
of deaths are occurred in both Sub Saharan Africa and
Southern Sub Saharan Africa has the highest maternal
mortality ratio at of maternal deaths
annually In Ethiopia the maternal mortality ratio is sig
nificantly reduced from deaths per live births
to death per live births but it
remains high
The maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in
is twenty times higher than in developed countries
The difference in maternal mortality ratio is also present
within countries between urban and rural residents and
between high and low income women
Pregnancy and childbirth related mortality are unavoid
able due to three delays These are delays in deciding to
International Journal of Reproductive Medicine
seek care delays in accessing and reaching appropriate
care and delays in receiving appropriate care once a
health facility is reached The first delay influences the
probability of the second and third delay Their poor per
ception of pregnancy related risks and complications leads
pregnant women to delay decision making to seek obstet
ric care

risk perception and associated factors among pregnant
women attending antenatal care at health centers in Jabi

signs
In this study of pregnant women had a good
pregnancy risk perception Studies conducted at health and
medical enters of Hamadan City in the west of Iran
tertiary care hospitals in Winnipeg Manitoba two major
teaching hospitals of a city in Western Canada and urban
tertiary care hospital in western Canada showed that their
mean score perception of pregnancy risk was below the
midpoint of scales It means that of their study par
ticipants perceived that their susceptibility to pregnancy
related complications was mild This difference might be
due to that all the research was conducted using a visual
analog scale tool measurement which is only administered
for literate people data collection tool difference sociocul
tural difference sample size difference and time gap of the
study
This study showed that and of
study subjects perceived that they were susceptible to
pregnancy related complications This finding was higher
than those studies conducted in Mandera County Kenya
This difference might be due to sociocultural differ
ences of study participants study population and time gap
of the study
This research showed that and of
pregnant women were perceived them to be susceptible to
bad pregnancy outcomes and and
were perceived that they are susceptible to difficult preg
nancy periods This finding was consistent with the study
conducted in Mandera County Kenya
In this study and of pregnant
women perceived that their baby will be born prema
turely This result was consistent with studies conducted
in Mandera County Kenya But studies con
ducted at Hamadan City Iran and Winnipeg Manitoba
showed that mean score perceptions were below the
midpoint of scales that indicate mild risk perception
This difference might be due to the difference of mea
surement scale sociocultural difference and time gap of
the study
This study revealed that and of
pregnant women were perceived that the occurrence of preg
nancy complications would not threaten their relationship
with their partners which is lower than a study conducted
in Mandera County Kenya This difference might
be due to the sociocultural difference of study participants
and the time gap of the study Besides it may be because
Ethiopian women were honest with their husbands to keep
their promise during the marriage

In this study mean score perception pregnancy risk in
pregnant women showed that they did not perceive that they
are at risk for dying due to pregnancy related complications
Studies conducted in Winnipeg Manitoba Western Canada
and the west of Iran had mild risk perception This difference
may be due to differences in measurement scale data collec
tion tool sociocultural difference and educational status of
respondents
Approximately seventy percent of women perceived that
their babies would die during labor and delivery This result
was inconsistent with studies conducted in western Canada
and Hamadan City in the west of Iran This difference may
be due to differences in measurement scale sociocultural
difference and educational status of respondents
Pregnant women who had awareness of pregnancy
danger signs were more likely to have positive pregnancy
risk perception than their counterparts This may be due to
knowledge about pregnancy danger signs clearing rumors
about pregnancy related complications and increasing their
awareness about pregnancy related complications
According to this study pregnant women with bad obstet
ric history were more likely to have positive pregnancy risk
perception This may be due to pregnant women being famil
iarized with the bad obstetric outcome and learning their
susceptibility towards pregnancy related complications
In this research one of the factors that affecting posi
tively pregnancy risk perception was knowing a woman
who died due to pregnancy related complications This
may be because these women learned the probability of
developing pregnancy related complications as well as the
consequences of pregnancy related complications from
women s death due to pregnancy related complications
Generally pregnant women with a bad obstetric his
tory past obstetric complication and knew a woman
who died due to pregnancy related complications were
associated with pregnancy risk perception This result
was similar to the concept of availability of the Heuristic
approach which means that an individual makes a judg
ment about likelihood of an event based on experience
or information from others In this study experience
and information from others are pregnant women with
bad obstetric history and past obstetric complications
and knew a woman who died due to pregnancy related
complications respectively
In this study age of pregnant women is not significantly
associated with pregnancy risk perception But women
aged years had statistically significantly associated
with pregnancy risk perception than women aged to
in studies conducted at health and medical centers of
Hamadan City in the west of Iran This difference might
be due to sampling size difference pregnant women
versus pregnant women age category difference
years versus years study participant difference both
nulliparous and multiparous versus only nulliparous mea
surement scale differences Likert scale versus visual analog
scale and the difference in data collection tools
Conclusion
The pregnant women perceive that they were risky in
developing pregnancy related complications and their
consequences were low Only forty eight percent of preg
nant women had good pregnancy risk perception This is
likely to have implications for medical care and pregnancy
outcomes
History of obstetric complication and bad obstetric his
tory was associated with a higher degree of actual risk per
ception in pregnancy whilst women who knew the death of
pregnant women due to pregnancy complication and knew
at least one pregnancy danger signs were more likely to be
concerned about risk
Strength The strength of this research is that it is the
primary research conducted in Ethiopia and Africa Besides
the research measures the outcome variables using the two
components of the health belief model perceived suscepti
bility and severity
Limitations This study was conducted within the
clinical area Therefore the results cannot be generalized to
a woman who failed to attend antenatal care In addition
cultural influence of pregnancy risk perception should be
identify using a qualitative research approach but this
research lacks it

Calculate Feeding Requirements
The objective of Calculate Feeding Requirements inference
is to determine the main feeding requirements for a specific
child according to the determined age stage driven in the
previous inference step with the support of a number of
specifications such as gender and activity status The main
feeding requirements are defined by driven the required
amount of calories These determined requirements are then
taken into consideration in producing the meals schedule for
the child Calculate Feeding Requirements inference derives
its goal by applying the Calculate Needed Calories table that
is defined in the Feeding Requirements Model
Determine Meals Schedule
The objective of Determine Meals Schedule inference is to
determine the main goal of the system which is presenting the
suitable meals schedule for the child according to the child s
feeding requirements with considering the child s health
status of the child is considered as well as the food unites

CASE STUDY
A web application has been developed for the proposed
system The knowledge base of the proposed children
nutrition expert system is implemented using the Mini
Knowledge Share and Reuse tool MiniKSR while the
control of the system and the user interface were
implemented by Visual Basic Net Microsoft Visual Studio
We have applied two case studies on the developed
system to determine the system accuracy in generating the
suitable meal We changed the values of the required
parameters for example in the health status parameter one
experiment was applied for a healthy child while the second
was applied for a diabetic child We then measured the
accuracy of the system by reviewing the output with experts
in the nutrition field who approved the generated nutrition
schedule
In this section we will present the steps applied in the
developed system showing the steps of these experiments
with demonstrating the developed user interface in the
presented figures
In fig the user enters the required information for the
child they are the birth day gender and activity level and
the health status if exists such as diabetic
In the first case the child is a male was born in
and his activity level is moderately with no health status that
should be considered According to this inputs Calculate
Child Growth Stage subtask will call Calculate Age Stage
inference step to drive the child growth stage which is
determined to be preschool Then Calculate Child Feeding
Requirements subtask will use the output of the previous
inference step to call Calculate Feeding Requirements
inference step which drives the needed calories based on the
child age stage gender and activity level The minimum need
calories is determined by the system to be and the
maximum is Now the Determine Child Meals Schedule
subtask is ready to generate the suitable meal schedule
The system determines the generated needed food unit from
each food category for the presented case Then it determines

applicability of the system However validating the
knowledge for the proposed system and completing the
knowledge base are two of the main future directions Since
the proposed prototype is a first step towards a complete
expert system for a broader target which is providing a whole
nutrition plan for children with explanation facilities and
different varieties of food based on their preferences We also
aim to include more than one plan for the child status to
provide more varieties considering different situations such as
the family financial level Moreover we aim to provide
bilingual interface English and Arabic for more population
to the presented system to serve different levels of families
including education level and financial level

Gestational diabetes mellitus and antenatal
BACKGROUND
depression are common comorbidities However the combined effects of
antenatal depression and diabetes mellitus during pregnancy on fetal
cell function are unknown
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to test whether the association of
maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and glucose metabolism with cord
blood C peptide levels varies with antenatal depression
STUDY DESIGN Data on motheFchild pairs N from the
Maternal and Infant Health Study in Hefei were analyzed
Gestational diabetes mellitus was diagnosed using the g oral glucose
tolerance test at to weeks of gestation Antenatal depression was
measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during
midpregnancy and late pregnancy Cord blood samples were collected at
delivery and tested for C peptide levels
RESULTS A total of mothers were diagnosed with ges
tational diabetes mellitus Gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with
a confidence internl percentile higher cord blood
C peptide level This association varied with depression severity the differen
ces in cord blood C peptide percentile for gestational diabetes mellitus vs no
gestational diabetes mellitus were confidence interual
for nonantenatal depression confidence interual
for moderate antenatal depression and confi
dence interual for severe antenatal depression in midpreg
nancy Similar associations stratified by antenatal depression in late
pregnancy were observed Antenatal depression was significantly positively
correlated with fetal hyperinsulinism in patticipants with gestational diabetes
mellitus but not in patticipants without gestational diabetes mellitus

circulating insulin levels C peptide is
released from the pancreatic cells and
secreted in equimolar levels with insu
lin Therefore cord blood C peptide
level can be used as an indicator of fetal
hyperinsulinism The gestation period is
considered a crucial time for cell
development and its structure and func
tion may be altered by an adverse
intrauterine environment In pregnant
women with GDM hyperglycemia is
transported to the fetus through the pla
centa causing fetal hyperglycemia which
stimulates the proliferation of fetal islet
cells and increases insulin secretion
thereby promoting fetal growth and fat
accretion The impairment of placental
function by placental inflammation
which is caused by GDM may directly
induce fetal injury or insult to the islet
structures
Depression is a prevalent central ner
vous system condition that affects many
people with diabetes mellitus
In a
meta analysis of studies AD was
linked to risks of GDM with a fold
higher incidence than in controls AD
results in enhanced hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal HPA axis activation
and affects the epigenetic status and
genetic expression in the placenta
which may compromise placental bar
rier function and influence fetal devel
opment However to the best of our
knowledge no study has examined
whether the association between GDM
and fetal hyperinsulinism varies with
AD
Given these previously reported
associations we hypothesized that the
relationship between maternal GDM and
cord blood C peptide levels would vary
with AD To test our hypothesis we
conducted this multicenter prospective
large sample cohort study to examine
the relationship among maternal GDM
cord blood C peptide level and AD

AJOG MFM at a Glance
Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to test whether the association of maternal gestational diabetes
mellitus GDM and glucose metabolism with cord blood C peptide levels varies
with antenatal depression AD
Key findings
GDM was associated with higher cord blood C peptide levels and varied by
depression severity in both midpregnancy and late pregnancy In addition AD
was significantly positively correlated with fetal hyperinsulinism in participants
with GDM but not in participants without GDM
What does this add to what is known
AD which is related to maternal hyperglycemia can aggravate the risk of fetal
hyperinsulinism in early life Thus psychological factors during pregnancy may
be potentially important targets in the early stages of life for interventions to pre
vent glucose metabolism disorders in childhood

We did not include participants who
were taking any type of medication for
diabetes mellitus or required insulin
treatment during pregnancy
Fasting maternal venous blood sam
ples drawn from participants during
midpregnancy weeks of gesta
tion were used to evaluate maternal
insulin resistance information using the
homeostasis model assessment for insu
lin resistance HOMA IR index The
HOMA IR was calculated as follows
glucose x insulin Cord blood
was drawn from the participants during
delivery and used to evaluate the C pep
tide level and fetal cell function The
samples were processed in the same labo
ratory and stored in the freezer
until use The samples were processed in
the same laboratory and stored in the
freezer until analyzed
The participants were asked to report
their food intake in a face to face inter
view during late pregnancy using a food
frequency questionnaire FFQ which
was used to measure habitual dietary
intake in the preceding months FFQ
development and validation were previ
ously documented
The energy
intake from carbohydrates was calcu
lated as the consumption frequency
multiplied by the carbohydrate content
of each food item Information on
maternal glucose levels and birth out
comes sex gestational age weight
small for gestational age SGA and
large for gestational age LGA was
collected from the patients medical
records SGA was defined as a birth
weight of percentile for gesta

Ascertainment of antenatal
depression
Maternal antenatal depressive symptoms
were measured using the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale EPDS at
midpregnancy weeks of gesta
tion and late pregnancy weeks
of gestation to establish the natural
course of the AD We used the Chinese
version of the EPDS which has been
translated into more than languages
The EPDS is a self reported depression
questionnaire composed of questions
that have been validated for use in the
perinatal period Having clinically signifi
cant symptoms of depression was
defined as an EPDS score of
We defined levels of AD O to points
non AD to points moderate

and the association became stronger
with increasing AD severity In addition
AD was associated with higher cord
blood C peptide levels in pregnant par
ticipants with GDM However no signif
icant association was observed among
participants without GDM This study
reported the function of maternal mental
health factors in the intergenerational
transmission of metabolic disorders
Results and clinical and research
implications
Mounting evidence suggests that GDM
predisposes the offspring to metabolic
disorders in later life independent
of maternal obesity or genetic
background
Previous studies dem
onstrated a continuous association
between maternal glucose levels and the
risk of higher cord PG levels and fetal
hyperinsulinemia clinical diagnosis of

The
International
Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy
Outcome study demonstrated that cord
blood C peptide level was negatively
associated with childhood insulin sensi
tivity and positively associated with an
increased risk of newborn adiposity
Our results are in line with previous
findings of GDM which showed a
consistently positive
relationship
between I hour PG and hour PG and
cord blood C peptide level Although
the relationship between GDM and
cord blood C peptide was demonstrated
previously differences in this associa
tion between populations have not been
reported Here we performed a stratifi
cation analysis and found that the posi
tive association of cord blood C peptide
and GDM seems stronger in partici

levels were stronger in pregnant partici

influence glucose control which influ
ences the intrauterine milieu Here we
found no significant difference in glyce
mic control between the groups with

association between GDM and high
cord blood C peptide levels however
the underlying mechanism remains
unknown The adverse intrauterine
environment during human pregnancy
strongly affects the fetoplacental vascu
lar morphology The available evi
dence suggests that maternal glucose is
passively transferred from the mother
to the fetus across the placenta
Hyperglycemia may stimulate placental
cells which buffer excess maternal glu
cose or increase vascular resistance
leading to changes in various key mole
cules including gene expression
inflammatory cytokines and placental
endothelial dysfunction
This could
result in more maternal glucose enter
ing the fetal circulation which causes
cell hyperplasia in the fetus and over
stimulates the release of insulin from
the fetal pancreas
Multiple studies have revealed an
association between depression and
increased HPA axis activation
It is
possible that after heightened maternal
stress the maternal fetal interface can
be disrupted by placental immune sen
sitization which affects fetal HPA axis
development Nevertheless disruption
of the HPA axis may contribute to pla

epigenetic status or expression of genes
encoding the II hydroxysteroid dehy
drogenase type enzyme in the pla
centa which can compromise placental
barrier function We speculate that
AD aggravates the injury to the placen
tal endothelium and exacerbates the
intergenerational transmission of meta
bolic disorders In addition elevations
in maternal glucose levels may be asso
ciated with maternal catecholamine ele
vations with associated maternal mood
dysfunction This further explains the
increased cord blood C peptide levels in
pregnant participants with GDM with
AD
In addition positive associations
were observed between AD and cord
blood C peptide levels However previ
ous studies revealed inconsistent con
clusions regarding the relationship
between depression and C peptide lev
els in nonpregnant populations How
ever few studies have focused on the
association between AD and cord blood
C peptide levels The current study may
provide evidence of the effect of mater
nal emotional problems on health in
early life Interestingly after analyses
stratified for GDM we observed a posi
tive association between fetal hyperin
sulinemia and AD in pregnant
participants with GDM whereas no
association was observed in pregnant
participants without GDM despite the
adjustment for potential confounders
Our study extended previous work by
investigating the combined effects of
GDM and AD on fetal hyperinsuline
mia revealing that GDM comorbid
depression may be double hits to the
developing fetal cell function A
potential explanation for our results
might be that in maternal hyperglyce
mia which always causes placental
endothelial dysfunction molecular sub
strates mediated by depression pass
through the placenta more easily which
can affect the fetal islets However fur
ther research is required to understand
this transport process
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths First it
was based on a birth cohort with a rela
tively large population and rich
questionnaire data used to assess poten
tial confounding factors Second this
was the first study to reveal the role of
psychological factors during pregnancy
in the intergenerational transmission of
metabolic disorders In particular we
analyzed AD in midpregnancy and late
pregnancy simultaneously rather than
at a single point in time Finally sensi
tivity analyses were performed using
subgroup analyses to increase the reli
ability of our interpretations Fourth in
addition to conducting subgroup and
sensitivity analyses to further evaluate
the association we performed a dose
response analysis to fully understand
this relationship
This study has several limitations
First it did not obtain a clinical diagno
sis of AD thus outcome misclassifica
tion was possible However a validated
screening scale which has been used in
multiple studies in China was used for
the diagnosis
Second we cannot
account for the contributions of unmea
sured factors to emotional changes in
depression over time such as stress and
anxiety that are caused by work or
changing attitudes toward pregnancy
outcomes Third although we have
excluded pregnant participants with
abnormal blood glucose control we are
still unable to obtain dynamic blood
glucose readings for further compari
son Therefore we cannot rule out the
effect of differences in blood glucose
control This limitation could poten
tially affect the ability to evaluate the
effect of GDM on fetal hyperinsulinism
under different blood glucose fluctua
tion conditions Fourth because the
study design was observational no
causal inference could be drawn and
only associations could be described
Finally some residual confounding fac
tors may exist despite the adjustment
for the most important ones
Conclusions
AD enhanced the association between
GDM and cord blood C peptide levels
and increased the risk of hyperinsuline
mia in the offspring of mothers with
GDM These results expand our under
standing of the role of psychological
factors during pregnancy in the
Original Research
intergenerational transmission of meta
bolic disorders Psychological factors
during pregnancy may be potentially
important targets in the early stages of
life for interventions to prevent glucose
metabolism disorders in childhood
Further clinical research and prospec
tive birth cohort studies are needed to
validate these findings

BACKGROUND In nonpregnant populations sodium intake has been
associated with the development of chronic hypertension and sodium
restriction has been identified as a strategy to reduce blood pressure
Data regarding the relationship between sodium intake and the develop
ment of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are limited and conflicting
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the association between daily
periconceptional sodium intake and the risk of hypalensive disorders of
pregnancy
STUDY DESIGN This was a secondary analysis of the prospective Nullip
arous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers To Be study Individu
als with nonanomalous singleton pregnancies who completed food frequency
questionnaires with recorded sodium intake in the months before pregnancy
were included in the analysis Individuals whose pregnancies did not progress
beyond weeks of gestation were excluded from the analysis Sodium
intake was categorized as low g per day medium to g per day
or high g per day based on thresholds used in the nonpregnant popula
tion The primary outcome was the development of a new onset hypertensive
disorder of pregnancy including gestational hypettension preeclampsia
hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome superim
posed preeclampsia or eclampsia Bivariable analyses were performed using
Kruskal Wallis and chi square tests Poisson regression was used to estimate
adjusted incidence risk ratios with confidence intervals after controlling
for potentially confounding factors
RESULTS Among individuals included in this analysis
reported low sodium intake repotted medium sodium
intake and reported high sodium intake Individuals with high
sodium intake were more likely to have chronic hypertension to use
tobacco and to be living with obesity The risk of developing a hyperten
Sive disorder of pregnancy was similar among groups medium vs low
adjusted incidence risk ratio confidence interval
high vs low adjusted incidence risk ratio confidence interval
There was no difference in neonatal outcomes by sodium
intake including preterm birth small for gestational age neonate and
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit
CONCLUSION Sodium intake was not associated with the risk of
developing a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy This lack of association
contrasts with that between sodium intake and hypertension in the non
pregnant state and may reflect differences in the pathophysiology underly
ing pregnancy vs non pregnancy related hypertensive disorders
Key words diet gestational hypalension hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy preeclampsia sodium

interventions to prevent and treat these
disorders remain limited
Outside of pregnancy there is consid
erable evidence to support the relation
ship between sodium intake and both the
development and control of chronic
hypertension A meta analysis of
cohort studies published in identi
fied a linear relationship between sodium
intake and the risk of hypertension with
an excess risk of hypertension noted with
an intake of g of sodium per day
An earlier systematic review and meta
analysis of trials including partic
ipants found that a modest reduction in
sodium intake for weeks was associ
ated with significant decreases in blood
pressure among both individuals with
hypertension and individuals with normal
blood pressure
Data regarding the relationship
between sodium intake and HDPs
have been less conclusive For example
although increased salinity of drinking
water has been associated with an
increased risk of developing HDPs
sodium restriction during pregnancy
has not been shown to decrease the
frequency of HDPs There are few
data available regarding the relationship
between periconceptional sodium intake
and the development of HDPs Given
the importance of preventing the devel
opment of HDPs this study aimed to
investigate the relationship between
periconceptional sodium intake and the
development of HDP with the goal of
better understanding sodium intake as a
potentially modifiable risk factor

Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to investigate the association between periconceptional sodium
intake and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy HDPs
Key findings
Periconceptional sodium intake was not associated with the development of
HDPs
What does this add to what is known
Study findings indicate that the assessment of periconceptional sodium intake
should not inform counseling regarding the risk of HDPs and that decreasing
sodium intake is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing the risk of
hypertensive disorder

Discussion
Principal findings
In this secondary analysis of a large pro
spective cohort study in the United
States which included the collection of
detailed periconceptional dietary data
via a validated questionnaire we found
that self reported periconceptional
sodium intake categorized based on
commonly recommended guidelines
was not associated with a risk of the
development of HDPs In addition the
risk of adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes did not differ with the
reported amount of sodium intake
Results
There is evidence to support a low salt
diet as an intervention to reduce hyper
tension in nonpregnant populations
In addition sodium restriction has been
used historically to treat preeclampsia

Our study which examines reported

and extends findings from another
study of data Petersen et
al used the FFQ data from the

sodium intake as one of their dietary
exposures it was assessed differently
than in our analysis Specifically it was
evaluated in the context of dietary den

work focused on preeclampsia specifi

intake by daily quantity and analyzed
the association with all new onset

body of literature suggesting that there
is also no association between pericon
ceptional sodium intake and the devel
opment of HDPs Of note there was an
association between sodium intake and
HDPs before the adjustment for con
founding variables it is possible that
individuals have concomitant dietary
habits such as high sugar and high salt
intake that alter their risk of multiple
comorbidities

support system for prediction
of gestational diabetes mellitus

Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM a common pregnancy complication associated with many
maternal and neonatal consequences is increased in mothers with overweight and obesity
Interventions initiated early in pregnancy can reduce the rate of GDM in these women however
untargeted interventions can be costly and time consuming We have developed an explainable
machine learning based clinical decision support system CDSS to identify at risk women in need
of targeted pregnancy intervention Maternal characteristics and blood biomarkers at baseline from
the PEARS study were used After appropriate data preparation synthetic minority oversampling
technique and feature selection five machine learning algorithms were applied with five fold cross
validated grid search optimising the balanced accuracy Our models were explained with Shapley
additive explanations to increase the trustworthiness and acceptability of the system We developed
multiple models for different use cases theoretical AUC PR AUC ROC GDM screening
during a normal antenatal visit AUC PR AUC ROC and remote GDM risk assessment
AUC PR AUC ROC Our models have been implemented as a web server that is publicly
available for academic Use Our explainable CDSS demonstrates the potential to assist clinicians in
screening at risk patients who may benefit from early pregnancy GDM prevention strategies
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM is generally defined as glucose intolerance of varying degrees of severity
with onset or first recognition during pregnancy l The risk of GDM is increased with overweight and
of which the global prevalence has increased substantially in the past GDM increases the risk of many
maternal and neonatal complications such as gestational hypertension polyhydramnios Caesarean birth prema
ture delivery large for gestational age and neonatal macrosomia intensive care unit admission hypoglycaemia
and respiratory Moreover GDM may predispose to long term sequelae for both mother and child
including metabolic syndrome and type diabetes thus increasing later life chronic disease
Research shows that interventions initiated early in pregnancy can reduce the rate of GDM in pregnant
women with overweight and However applying interventions in every instance can be costly and time
consuming A clinical decision support system CDSS based on machine learning can be helpful in providing
a powerful and objective computerised tool to assist clinicians identify women at risk of GDM It would largely
reduce the time and cost by allowing targeted intervention The CDSS has great potential in clinical settings
especially under the circumstance that many clinicians have turned to telemedicine to maintain social distancing
during the COVID
CDSSs have a great potential to improve healthcare delivery though literature on their successful adoption
especially that of machine learning based CDSSs is scarce Shortliffe and indicated that aside from
system accuracy effciency and usability are important for a CDSS to be accepted and integrated into clinical
workflow A CDSS should be time saving intuitive and simple to use in order to obtain system outputs easily
while juggling a heavy clinical workload They also pointed out that black boxes are not acceptable for CDSSs
This is inline with Antoniadi et al ll who indicated that explainability is a critical component for a CDSS to be
adopted in practical use effectively A famous example by Caruana et al shows that a machine learning based
system can reflect the pattern in the training data but be inconsistent with medical knowledge and thus does not
translate to clinical practice Their system predicted that patients who had a history of asthma had a lower risk

Table Previously published machine learning based GDM risk prediction models Where multiple models
were developed the best performing model is described
of dying from pneumonia than the general population This is because patients who had asthma and presented
with pneumonia usually receive aggressive care which lowers their risk Even though the system truly captured
the training data it would be problematic if adopted in clinical practice without understanding why the model
behaved this way Such problems can be resolved using Explainable Artificial Intelligence XAI Many benefits
have been reported in the use of XAI in CDSS including enhancing decision confidence generating the hypoth
esis about causality and increasing acceptability and trustworthiness of the system Nevertheless there is an
overall distinct lack of the application of XAI in CDSSs in the published literaturell
We aim to apply machine learning to develop a CDSS that predicts the risk of GDM in a high risk group
of women with overweight and obesity to identify those who may benefit from prevention strategies early in
pregnancy We performed modeling on baseline maternal characteristics and blood biomarkers collected in the
Pregnancy Exercise and Nutrition with smart phone application support PEARS study Multiple probabilistic
prediction models incorporating different feature subsets were developed for different use cases including theo
retical routine antenatal and remote risk assessment Intelligent optimization algorithms were not considered in
this work Clinical usability was taken into account throughout the modeling process Moreover we applied
Shapley additive explanations SHAP a game theoretic XAI method to explain the models and thus make them
more acceptable and trustworthy for clinicians The models were implemented as a web server based CDSS that
is open for academic use Our CDSS has a potential to help clinicians identify women at risk of GDM in early
pregnancy
The rest of the paper is organised as follows Section Related work reviewed previous research done in the
related field The data modeling process and explanation method used in this research are introduced in Sec
tion Methods Section Results describes our final models and their performance on white and non white
populations as well as the implementation of a CDSS prototype and a case study The discussion of our findings
are presented in Section Discussion Section Conclusion concludes this paper
Related work
We comprehensively reviewed original research articles published between Jan and Dec on the use
of machine learning to predict the risk of GDM The search was performed on PubMed Science Direct Scopus
IEEE and ACM The search terms are machine learning gestational diabetes mellitus and risk prediction
A total of nine papers were deemed relevant and summarized in Table
Given the prevalence of GDM there are usually many more non GDM cases than GDM cases leading to
unbalanced datasets Some of the studies have not successfully addressed this class imbalance problem which may
lead to the development of models that perform well for the majority class non GDM only i e high specificity
but low sensitivity In addition most models have not been designed for use in a clinical setting All models
focused on GDM prediction in general pregnant women whereas prediction in a high risk group would allow
for more cost effective GDM screening which would be more suitable for clinical use Only Artzi et al and
Wu et al considered the impact of the number or accessibility of features included on the clinical usability of
the models in the modeling process Additionally Artzi et al is the only group of researchers who included
the explainability in the model design However they did not provide justification of why their model made a
specific prediction for an instance local interpretation Moreover due to the geographic area where maternal
data were collected all models are trained on data from women who are predominantly from the same ethnic
group There is a lack of studies that investigate the differences that might be associated with different cultural
or ethnic backgrounds in GDM prediction Additionally there is a lack of implementation of the models into
an open access web server or application which allows for benchmarking or validation There is a randomised
controlled trial designed to screen for high risk women using the model by Wu et al and assess the effect of
an individualised nutritional intervention to prevent GDM in this but the model is not publicly
available for academic use

Methods
Study design and data This research is a secondary analysis of the Pregnancy Exercise and Nutrition with
smart phone application support PEARS study a randomised controlled trial carried out
at the National Maternity Hospital NMH Dublin Ireland between and The study was approved
by ethical committee of National Maternity Hospital All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant
guidelines and regulations
The PEARS study recruited women with singleton pregnancy and a body mass index BMI kg
at IO weeks gestation to investigate the prevention of GDM using a behavioural antenatal lifestyle intervention
supported by a smartphone application in pregnancies complicated by overweight and obesity Maternal written
informed consent was acquired at study enrolment The PEARS participants were stratified by BMI and randomly
assigned into control standard antenatal care and intervention additional dietary and physical activity advice
with reinforcement using mHealth technology groups During the PEARS study a variety of data were collected
from these participants including maternal characteristics blood biomarkers ultrasound measurements food
intake exercise and lifestyle behaviors maternal and neonatal outcomes GDM was diagnosed according to the
International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups IADPSG at approximately
weeks gestation
In this research we excluded PEARS participants who dropped out or were excluded from the PEARS study
and those without available GDM diagnostics As a result PEARS participants were included Because the
PEARS study did not find any significant difference between the incidence of GDM in the control and interven
tion group we did not consider the impact of the PEARS intervention in this research
As we aimed to predict GDM in early pregnancy the descriptive features used are clinical data collected at
the PEARS randomisation visit weeks gestation also referred to as the baseline These features are
maternal anthropometry demographic characteristics family history and blood biomarkers They are described
in Table
Figure shows the workflow overview of this research
Data preparation Many features included in this research have missing values as shown in Fig We
dropped features with greater than missing values complement component C reactive protein
CRP leptin and adiponectin The missing values in the remaining features were imputed Several imputation
methods were considered median or mean for numerical features and mode for categorical features k Nearest
Neighbors kNN imputation and iterative imputation In order to select the best imputation method for our
dataset we extracted the complete cases of the dataset and generated missing values in these cases fol
lowing the same missing pattern in the entire dataset This is done by randomly selecting instances from the
entire dataset and copying the feature missingness in these instances into the complete cases Then we imputed
these generated missing values using the candidate imputation methods and calculated the mean absolute error
MAE between the imputed and true values after a min max scaler As shown in Fig mean mode impu
tation achieved the highest MAE followed by median mode imputation and kNN imputation with different
parameters Iterative imputation achieved the lowest MAE showing that this method is able to generate imputed
values closest to the real values for this dataset Therefore we applied the iterative imputation to impute the miss
ing values in the dataset
of the participants included were white therefore participants from other ethnic origins were held
out as an independent cross cultural ethnic test set After that of the white participants in the dataset
stratified by the GDM diagnosis were randomly selected as the training set The remaining was used as an
independent test set
Feature selection First of all we aimed to remove redundant features to avoid the curse of dimension
ality and reduce the number of inputs required to use the models in a clinical setting Figure shows the
Pearson correlation between features We defined redundant features as those with correlation greater than
As a result maternal weight BMI and mid upper arm circumference MUAC insulin and C peptide and total
cholesterol and Low Density Lipoprotein LDL cholesterol were deemed to be redundant This is consistent
with the medical knowledge weight BMI and MUAC are all anthropometric measurements that provide assess
ment of nutritional status and BMI is derived from height and weight Insulin and C peptide are released from
the pancreas at the same time and the same rate LDL cholesterol is calculated from total cholesterol High Den
sity Lipoprotein HDL cholesterol and triglycerides To reduce feature redundancy we removed features with
higher percentage of missing values prior to imputation see Fig to minimise the impact of imputation and
ensure the credibility of data As a result MUAC and C peptide are removed The remaining redundant features
that have the same level of missing values are weight and BMI and LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol Ihe
latter of each pair is calculated from the former Among them we removed derived features BMI LDL choles
terol and kept the original features weight total cholesterol to save computational time
Moreover we conducted the feature selection process in close collaboration with clinical experts In the
existing literature there is conflicting evidence reporting both positive and negative relationships with GDM
and maternal education level a indicator of socioeconomic In our dataset the average education level
is higher in GDM participants than non GDM participants which can be explained by the positive relationship
between maternal age and education This is consistent with the indirect effect of maternal education on GDM
through high pre pregnancy BMI and older age that Bertolotto et al suggested based on data collected in Italy
However a cohort study in the Netherlands suggests low educated women have an increased risk of
In order for our modeling results to be generalisable among different populations and to avoid confusion in a
clinical setting we removed education in consultation with clinical experts

biomarkers are not routinely assessed Also excluding these features can reduce the cost for a GDM prediction
Pobal HP deprivation index a measurement of the women s socioeconomic status based on the geographical
area of their residence was excluded because it is only available in Ireland and it limits the applicability of our
model to other regions Model was designed to work in remote settings without a hospital visit so all features

Explainability Logistic regression models are inherently transparent and explainable Random forest
SVM AdaBoost and XGBoost models are more algorithmic complex making it more diffcult for clinicians to
understand how predictions are made For such models we applied Kernel a model agnostic game the
oretic post hoc interpretation method to improve model explainability SHAP is a unified approach of feature
importance with desirable properties and it provides both explanations for the structure of the model global
explainability and for a specific prediction local explainability SHAP was applied to improve explainability
for a machine learning based CDSS in In our research global feature importance is calculated by
the averaged absolute SHAP values of the entire independent test set for each feature to help users gain insight
of the overall behavior of the model Furthermore we used SHAP values of a particular instance to explain how
each feature and its value contribute to the predicted GDM risk for this participant

predictors of GDM Our models perform similarly on the entire independent test set and the complete cases in
the independent test set showing that the imputation has little effect on model evaluation

Model achieved similar overall performance on the non white and white population giving an AUC PR of
and an AUC ROC of However at the decision threshold of the model is able to correctly predict
of non white non GDM participants and only of non white GDM participants
From the comparison of the model performance on the independent test set and the independent cross
cultural ethnic test set we found that our models especially Model and achieved high specificity but low
sensitivity at the decision threshold of on the independent cross cultural ethnic test set although similar
overall performance AUC PR and AUC ROC was observed In order to achieve an unbiased performance a
lower decision threshold for non white population is required As a result we conclude that our GDM prediction
models require a lower decision threshold to generalise to a non white population
Implementation and worked example Our models have been implemented as a web server which
serves as a CDSS prototype The prototype allows users to submit the values for features required and it predicts
the probability that the person will develop GDM It also provides explanations in order for users to understand
and trust the predictions The prototype is freely available for academic use at http lisda ucd ie GDM risk
calculator
To test the prototype we selected two test cases which are similar but have different outcomes from the
independent test set see Table The two cases have similar values in most of the maternal characteristics except
for weight Case the GDM participant has extremely high weight while Case the non GDM participant
has below average weight Regarding blood biomarkers Case and have similar white cell count but Case
has higher fasting glucose and insulin than Case
Suppose a user wants to test our CDSS prototype on these cases They can simply enter the feature values for
each case into the corresponding input boxes on the web page and press the calculate button to get the results
The CDSS will present the predicted risk for the case as well as the explanations
Both cases were predicted correctly by Model and The predicted GDM risks for Case and are
and by Model and by Model and and by Model
Our models are SVM based models and they are explained by Kernel SHAP in a post hoc manner Figure
shows the features ranked by their the global feature importance based on mean absolute SHAP values in all
models Fasting glucose plays the most important role in Model achieving mean absolute SHAP values much
higher than all other features White cell count and weight are then of importance followed by family history
of DM and insulin In Model weight is the most important feature followed by maternal age and white cell
count Gestational age and family history of DM play a less important role in Model In Model maternal age
is the most important predictor followed by weight gestational age and family history of DM
Figure shows the the local feature contribution based on SHAP values for Case and as well as the pre
dicted GDM risk A blue band indicates that the feature is dragging the prediction down to class non GDM
while a pink band shows that the feature leads to an increase in the predicted GDM risk The length of the band
indicates the magnitude of the effect It can be seen that the feature contributing the most to the opposite outcome
of Case and in Model is fasting glucose The fasting glucose of mmol L largely increases the predicted
GDM risk for Case but the fasting glucose of mmol L decreases the risk for Case greatly This makes sense
because Case has fasting glucose close to the average in GDM participants but Case has fasting glucose equal
to the average in non GDM participants see Table In Model and the features that contribute the most
to the opposite outcome of Case and is weight A weight of kg largely increases the predicted GDM risk

Discussion
This is the first machine learning study that specifically targets pregnant women with overweight and obesity for
GDM prediction As opposed to previously published models see Table that predict GDM among all preg
nant women we focused on an at risk group rather than prediction of GDM in a general pregnant population
Targeting a high risk group is more helpful for clinicians as GDM is more diffcult to identify in this cohort and
it would allow GDM screening in an effcient manner in a clinical setting Also this can be particularly helpful
in clinical practice if combined with a mobile health supported lifestyle intervention that has been proven cost
effective in pregnant women with an elevated
Our dataset is highly unbalanced as the non GDM participants outnumber GDM participants greatly This
is also the case in previous works due to the prevalence of GDM Unless properly handled it can lead to a
model that only performs well on the majority non GDM class i e achieves high specificity but low sensitivity
see We applied SMOTE to oversample the minority class in the training data All of our models achieved
similar specificity and sensitivity showing that the class imbalance problem is adequately addressed In addition
we used balanced accuracy instead of accuracy when testing because the former gives a better evaluation of the
model performance in a class imbalance setting On the contrary accuracy is likely to overestimate the overall
performance of a model when it only performs well on the majority class
An advantage of the study is that we carefully took the clinical usability into account in the modeling process
Three models were developed Model which included all features available including fasting blood biomarkers
to assess GDM risk in a theoretical way Model which excluded fasting blood biomarkers for GDM prediction
in a clinical routine and Model including self reportable features only for remote use In contrast to our work
most models in the literature included data from clinical tests that are not routinely performed in an Irish clinical
setting see Table including fasting blood test as well as other tests that are not available in our dataset such
as coagulation function test and gene testing The inclusion of these data may lead to an increase in the model
performance but at the cost of usability because it makes the models diffcult to translate into clinical use Our
Model performs well achieving AUC ROC of O This is slightly lower than some published models which
included fasting blood tests because we included fewer blood tests and have focused on a high risk group of
women with overweight and obesity among whom GDM prediction is more diffcult compared to a general
pregnant population Our Model and although they gave lower performance than Model have greater
potential in a clinical setting as the features they use are easier to access clinically Compared with previous
works our Model included only one feature from routine blood tests whereas published models included
at least two blood test related features Our Model is the first model that does not include any blood test To
the best of our knowledge there is no other published model that is directly comparable to ours Our models
provide a novel benchmark for future researchers in GDM prediction We recognise that the performance of
our models may require further improvement for use in a clinical setting for example by using some intelligent
optimization algorithms

To further improve clinical usability we used feature selection to keep the amount of data entry on the CDSS
to a minimum so that our CDSS would not be time consuming for clinicians who have heavy workload to fit
into their workflow Our models included a very small set of features or compared with published models
which means our models would be easier and faster to use Moreover our feature selection process was
conducted in collaboration with clinical experts In our dataset education level is higher in GDM participants
than non GDM participants and we trained models on such data which also reflected that a higher education
increased the risk of GDM In literature conflict evidence was reported on the association of education and
GDM In order to avoid confusion and for our models to translate into clinical practice education was removed
in consultant with clinical experts
This is also the first machine learning study to investigate the potential ethnic cultural difference in GDM pre

impact of culture ethnicity on GDM prediction and their models may not be applicable to other populations
Our data was collected in a single centre in Dublin Ireland The majority of the participants are white
but black Chinese other Asian and mixed ethnic women are also included For the purpose of a novel inves
tigation of the cross cultural ethnic difference in GDM prediction in women with overweight and obesity we
trained models on a white population and tested them on non white women Our results show that AUC PR
and AUC ROC are similar between both groups however the decision threshold of leads to lower sensitiv
ity and higher specificity in non white women than white women It shows that a lower decision threshold is
required for a non white population as opposed to a white population in GDM prediction This is consistent
with medical literature which specifies that GDM is more prevalent in non white women than white women
We considered the explainability important in a CDSS Despite an open debate in literature on whether or not
XAI is necessary or worth the substantial cost the use of XAI has been reported to make CDSSs more acceptable
and trustworthy to users and it may translate into a greater use of In our research SHAP was applied
to explain overall behavior of our models as well as the specific prediction made for an instance Our case study
showed that SHAP generated reasonable explanations for our models In addition the effect of features on GDM
risk shown in the case study is consistent with medical knowledge We found out that a high baseline fasting
glucose increased the risk of GDM This is inline with medical literature which suggests median fasting glucose
is higher in GDM participants than others We also showed that a high maternal weight increased the risk of
GDM consistent with the increased risk of GDM with overweight and obesity indicated in literature Therefore
we anticipate that the explanations would help clinical users to gain insights into the model behavior and increase
the acceptability and trustworthiness of our CDSS and thus enhance the potential for use in a clinical setting
It also fills in the gap of the overall lack of XAI use in CDSSs
To protect data privacy mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR in EU and the Health
Research Regulations HRR in Ireland we avoided the use of instance based learning algorithms such as
k Nearest Neighbours kNN KNN models are lazy learners and they involve saving the original training set
for computation when new data come in They are suboptimal for a CDSS because they may lead to personal
data breaches
Our work has been implemented into a web server that is currently available for academic use It resolves
the problem of the lack of an open access model or system for academic benchmarking Further research is
required before adoption into clinical practice Also further cross cultural ethnic testing preferably on a much
larger sample size is needed to investigate the optimal decision threshold for different minority cultural or
ethnic groups In addition future work will be conducted to validate our prototype CDSS in a clinical setting
Conclusion
We developed an explainable machine learning based CDSS for the prediction of GDM in women with over
weight and obesity to identify high risk women for targeted intervention early in pregnancy The CDSS includes
multiple models for theoretical routine antenatal and remote settings to enhance clinical usability It also provides

explanations for both the structure of the models and each specific prediction to gain trust from clinicians A
web based prototype of the CDSS is implemented and publicly available for academic use We also investigated
the cross cultural ethnic difference in GDM prediction which implies that a non white population requires a
lower decision threshold than a white population Further research is required to validate the CDSS in a clinical
setting

Abstract
Introduction High risk pregnancy refers to pregnancy with an increased risk of adverse outcome in mother or the baby Scoring
the risk will identify mothers at risk earlier so that proper resource allocation planned management or timely referral to higher
centers is facilitated and thereby perinatal mortality or morbidity can be reduced
Methods pregnant women with term gestation admitted to labour room were evaluated The risk factors in each case were
assessed and their individual risk scores were determined using a simple scoring system Subsequently their perinatal outcomes
were compared to their respective risk scores
Results It was found that there was a significant association between poor perinatal outcome and high risk pregnancies predicted
by this scoring schedule of the cases belonged to high risk group out of which cases had maternal complications
Significant association between high risk score and perinatal mortality and birth asphyxia was found
Conclusions There was a significant correlation between high risk and poor perinatal outcome So a simple scoring system such
as the one used in our study can be adopted at primary and rural health centers as a screening tool to predict pregnancies at high
risk for poor perinatal outcome Thereby facilitating early referral of these women to tertiary care centres
Keywords High risk pregnancy Risk score Perinatal mortality Birth asphyxia Low birth weight
Introduction
A relatively small percentage of high risk obstetric
population gives rise to a disproportionately high
percentage of perinatal and maternal morbidity and
mortality Scoring the risk factors will be of immense
help to detect high risk pregnancies earlier and to
optimize their management l In our study we use a
simple and easily applicable risk scoring system for
detection of high risk pregnancy and to find the
correlation between the various degrees of risk and
perinatal outcome Such a scoring schedule will
facilitate early detection proper resource allocation
planned management and timely referral of high risk
antenatal women and thereby reduces perinatal
morbidity and mortality

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective The systematic review explores personal experiences and perceptions of and on resident Indian
women on family planning
Methods We included qualitative studies conducted among women husbands and mothers in law Search on five
databases published between and May and forward and backward citations search of included
studies were undertaken April Three stage screening and data extraction were done independently
Iterative process was followed to thematically analyse the data and presented it using the World Health Orga
nization conceptual framework on social determinants of health
Result Of citations we included qualitative studies Women s intent of using family planning services
methods was influenced by multiple factors such as socio demographic characteristics Women s agency and
social status affected their standing in family planning decision making Fear of side effects of contraception
methods access to information and support and cultural and religious beliefs hindered the use of modern
methods of contraceptive Undesirable attitudes of service providers influenced underutilisation of family
planning services Ineffective contraceptive choice counselling particularly for poor section of the community
and high risk groups were reported While considering inter pregnancy interval some of the women opted for
induced abortion to terminate unplanned pregnancy however had meagre acceptance for using modern con
traceptive methods
Conclusioru The findings call for reinvigorated efforts to provide effective and individually religiously regionally
and culturally appropriate interventions to improve family planning access and ultimately support better health
and rights of women in India
India a densely and second highest populated country in the world
is in a phase of demographic and epidemiological transition To control
its rising population India felt an urgency of Family Planning FP
program in and became one of the first countries to launch the
National Programme for Family Planning NPFP Since its launch
the NPFP has undergone various policy and implementation modifica
tions and currently operating as part of Reproductive Maternal
Newborn and Child Health and Adolescents Program RMNCAH In
the initial period of NPFP the emphasis was on natural methods e g
rhythm method subsequently the focus shifted on modern methods of
contraception such as condoms diaphragms and intra uterine devices

Over the years India has made progress in FP related indicators e
g reduction in fertility rate from in to in
Despite this achievement India is still distant in achieving some of the
targets laid down by the SDG i e satisfying the of the total de
mand by use of modern FP methods The unmet FP needs among In
dian women especially belonging to lower socio economic strata are
high About married and all women years use any
type of contraceptive and married and all women
years use modern contraceptive methods Among these women within
one year of use the discontinuation rate of contraceptives was high
which are related to multiple factors Compared to male sterilisation
and temporary modern contraceptives female sterilisation accounting
to of women between and years of age is the most preferred
approaches of limiting the family size The number of female steri
lisations carried out per annum is also higher as compared to other
countries In the unintended pregnancy rate in India was per
women years and one third of all the pregnancies ended in
induced abortions Furthermore the health facility survey conducted in
six Indian states reported that there were million abortions with a
rate of abortions per women in reproductive age group
By addressing FP needs more than of low and middle income
country s child deaths and morbidity associated with abortion and
pregnancy could be avoided
Considering this the govern
ment of India is committed to enhancing the demand for modern
reversible contraceptives use to among married women
years
To highlight commonalities or dissimilarities it is important to
collate and summarise the opinion and perspectives of people belonging
to a wider group or context on a complex phenomenon To the best of
our knowledge there are no qualitative systematic reviews conducted
on the resident Indian population that studied perceptions of FP Pre
vious qualitative systematic reviews conducted elsewhere were focused
on a subset of population such as age group provider or country
Therefore the present qualitative systematic review was designed to
explore personal experiences and perceptions of and on women about FP
in India This review will fill the gap by accounting for the experiences
expectations emotions needs opinions and feelings of resident Indian
women on the FP which will further help guide policies and frame FP
interventions in India

appropriate inter pregnancy interval using temporary or
permanent contraceptive methods Additionally we
considered studies that discussed treatment of involuntary
infertility
Women irrespective of age and fertility status in
reproductive age groups living in India were included
Additionally perception of husbands mothers and mothers
in law if provided in the study were captured to address
pluralism Men or mothers in law s opinion supplemented the
information in generating the similarities or dissimilarities in
women s opinion Nevertheless we excluded the study if it
was exclusively focused on men or healthcare providers In the
case of a mixed population we extracted perceptions of the
population of our interest Additionally we considered studies
undertaken on people living with HIV drug users and women
undergoing abortion if it was focused on phenomena of our
interest or had described at least one theme subtheme of
family planning Studies conducted in other countries among
Indian women such as American Indian were excluded
Journal publications theses dissertations reports books or
book chapters were included We included studies irrespective
of publication type or peer reviewed status However reviews
secondary analyses editorials commentaries letters and
conference proceedings were excluded
We included studies published in English
Selection of studies
EndNote x was used to manage the data and Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet for screening Two authors PH SSP screened citations by
their titles and abstracts independently Full text screening was un
dertaken independently by PH SSP and VSD in two groups Any dis
agreements between the authors on a decision to include the articles
were resolved by discussions until consensus within and between
groups
Data extraction
A data extraction sheet was prepared and extraction was carried out
by PH SSP and VSD independently in pairs Disagreements if any on
extracted data were resolved by discussions within and between the
pairs The extracted data included study identifiers data collection
methodology study location contextual details of participants and
qualitative data of phenomena themes and quotes
Data analysis
We undertook manual thematic analysis to analyse the qualitative
data
SSP read the extracted data multiple times and generated
the coding frame Quotations reported in included studies were read and
deciphered to get a deeper understanding of the data Each study was
examined for consistencies dissimilarities and contradictions in the
perceptions or experiences to generate a new wider understanding of
the phenomena without altering the originality of the primary data
S S Parsekar et al
The coding scheme enabled the systematic identification of analytic
patterns and theoretically important concepts SSP and PH further dis
cussed these codes refined them by rereading the study if needed and
grouped the codes after reaching consensus Subsequently repeated
occurring codes were synthesised and classified into overarching
themes which led to the development of thematic framework Within
each theme we described the content and meaning of the data extracted
from included studies To confirm trustworthiness the emerging themes
were re examined by all the authors Subsequently we prepared the
final list of themes through discussion and consensus A theme appear
ing in more than one paper does not justify the intensity of data validity
Therefore study references within a specific theme are reported To
summarise and explain the linkages between the themes and subthemes
we utilised the World Health Organization WHO conceptual frame

Discussion
To our best knowledge this qualitative systematic review is the first
one conducted to collate the evidence to inform on perceptions and
experiences of women about FP in India Findings highlights that the
multiple determinants influenced women s intent of using FP services or
methods These determinants can be linked to improving the unmet FP
needs and SRH and rights in conformity with the SDGs and
Although review participants were in favour of getting married after
years some women were married parous or pregnant before
attaining the legal age of marriage and years for women and men
in India respectively As per a national survey conducted in India
there were a significant proportion of adolescent years women
who were married and pregnant or parous in the year
This is a major concern especially for India considering
the effect of adolescent pregnancy and childbirth on MCH Early mar
riages are often associated with higher fertility rate early childbearing
practices shorter birth intervals and decreased knowledge and access to
FP methods
Marriage brings numerous responsibilities to women and women
are expected to perform in an ideal way as defined by societal pressure
and in laws expectations It is a cultural notion especially in India that
marriage is not only a union of two people but also a union of two
families Additionally marriage embarks on the societal and familial
expectation of initiating a childbearing and childrearing But soon after
marriage women are at the forefront to take the entire responsibility to
prove their womanhood and receive respect from the family and society
by being fertile and childbearing if not there was a threat for experi
encing discrimination and divorce
Most of our participants were not or minimally educated and had low
socio economic status The majority of the participants were favouring
small family size and were well versed with its benefits including
reduced financial burden MCH and other responsibilities associated
with child rearing The finding is congruent with existing evidence of
importance of investing in FP Nonetheless almost one fourth of the
studies reported that having a son was one of the prime factors for
influencing FP decision making Reasons for son preference were

Social policies As per government order Baiga
community in Chhattisgarh denied access to
family planning FP services as a result women
had multiple pregnancies which deteriorated
health Because of this women visited nearby
states to avail FP services or they hide gave up
their cultural identity
Some of the cultural and societal values related
to FP timing number gender of child were
mythic and women couple follow these norms
willingly However some participants presumed
that they do not have choice but to oblige
societal and family pressure Some norms are
specific to indigenous Muslim or Hindu family
Sub themes under this are described further
Women perceived the ideal age for marriage to be
years After marriage society expected woman
to be ideal wife and mother and women
perceived that it was their duty to fulfil these
expectations Women expressed that they were
expected to be sexually available for husbands
Husband s dominance in sexuality and women s
submissiveness were commonly reported Threats
from husband about re marriage were reported
Although polygamy among tribal was not
common it increases the fertility prospects
Also tribal population accepted the pre marital
sex and relationships as well as childbearing
However discussion on sex was a taboo and need
for sex education was discussed
Women perceived that it was the social obligation
to have their first child soon after marriage There
were different reported reasons for the same viz
Familial and societal pressure community
judgement and proving womanhood If a woman
has a child soon after marriage her social status
respect from society and family improves
Some women also shared threat of abandonment
if they don t have a child after marriage
Participants also shared consequences of
infertility
Family planning FP and culture FP is culturally
not acceptable in some culture Participants were
influenced by faith healers who discouraged FP
Participants avoid talking about family planning
because of shame or embarrassment Sterilisation
was not acceptable and barren woman s
prospect of going for levirate marriage decreased
Some other tribal practices were also discussed
which prevented women going for FP
Family planning and religion It was found that
people s volition in contraceptive use or sterilisation
was a sin Participants voiced that tribes were
banned from worshiping after sterilisation and
Islam forbids contraception or sterilisation They
often felt that it was God s wish in deciding the
number and timing of children Some also
expressed that if a woman was sterilised she was
considered impure for the last rites
Most participants expressed timing of childbearing
to be soon after marriage because it gives them
feeling of incompleteness Some felt it should be

delayed and others expressed it should be
depending on the age of the women
Sex composition and preference Only a subset of
women did not prefer a particular gender of the
child while others expressed to have one girl and
a boy Those who expressed girl preference felt
that girls are useful for instrumental help and they
get bride price Girl aversion was common
considering the dowry practice in India Son
preference was predominantly seen and was
determined by number of children economic
and social benefits family name and old age
support
Concept of family size and spacing varied between
studies Small family norm was expressed
considering the economic benefits future
prospects maternal and child health However
others felt having multiple children were useful
while some others left it on God s wish HIV
status of parents was also important predictor of
deciding the family size
Women s agency in terms of choice having
ability to opt for FP voice capacity to assert
one s interest and power in constraining or
enabling voice and choice is influenced by
multiple factors In contrast to younger
adolescent or youth and not less educated
women older women are more likely to have a
steady stand and decision of timing and number
of children Older women were more inclined to
use permanent sterilisation methods
Furthermore abuse from the husband threats
of divorce separation and remarriage made
women submissive to the men s decision on FP
Male dominance influence of mother in law and
women s submissive behaviour were commonly
reported by the included studies that were
hindering the socio economic position of
women However it was women s responsibility
to use the contraceptive methods and there was
resistance from men to use condom or male
sterilisation
Women who had strong premarital agency
agency here is a general concept and not
restricted to FP or who were older in age tended
to have better decision making power and they
were found to delay their marriage and
childbearing for career or education Other
socio demographic factors were employment
education age of women described in section
and husband s employment status Some
expressed joint decision making however
majority expressed it as male dominance Mother
in law s involvement in FP decision making is
strongly rooted in Indian culture Participants
reported female centric nature of contraception
and lack of involvement of husbands in FP
counselling or discussions
Women were aware of contraceptive methods but
were not aware of their proper use and were
found to be mostly using sterilisation rhythm
method and injectable Others were not aware of
reversible contraceptives other than abstinence FP
information was often sought from friends of the
same gender Accredited Social Health Activist or
were influenced by healthcare providers and
media Women had limited access to FP
information and expressed further need for
information Lack of awareness on FP was also
found among husbands Women s education
influenced use of FP Education and occupation
are interlinked and are related to economic
standing of the women Educated women may
have better access to information which in turn
help in making an informed decision making on
FP

Themes
Subthemes Categories
Women expressed desire to use contraception
but often left with no choice As a result they
were left with anxiety of pregnancy or tried
different tactics to avoid pregnancy such as going
to their natal house or subversive avoidance of
sexual intercourse coming to bed late and secretly
using FP methods
In line with the conceptual framework we
identified multiple intermediary determinants of
health Fear of side effects of reversible
contraceptives was one of the major
psychological barriers of using FP methods
Health status of women or of first born HIV
status of women or husband and history of drug
addiction influenced decision on use of FP
Furthermore access availability of healthcare
facilities and attitude of healthcare professionals
were documented Two conditions on which
people were deciding to take a call on the FP
methods or choices were family size achieved
and inter pregnancy interval When desired
family size was achieved participants either
opted for sterilisation or induced abortion
Whereas to achieve a desired inter pregnancy
interval family opted for contraceptives or
induced abortion This finding also suggests that
participants opted for induced abortion to
terminate unplanned pregnancy to limit the
number of children or spacing between the
pregnancies
Fertility intention among HIV positive or drug
users were expressed The desired were based on
existing child dren or son preference pressure
from society wanted some reason to live and
positive reinforcement after antiretroviral therapy
Inconsistent condom use was reported among
HIV positive individuals Desire to have a child
also depended on health of the couple fear of HIV
transmission to child and future prospects
Women usually resorted to abortion as a means
to end unintended pregnancy to limit family size
or wanted to have spacing between childbirths
Some even opted for multiple induced abortions
Reasons were first child s health or women s
health resistance to use contraception domestic
violence economic reasons sex selective abortion
first child male conceived in the month of Adi in
Tamil Nadu pregnant with man having same gotra
Clan influence of astrology and were shameful
because of existing adolescent child However
others considered abortion as sin Abortion
among unmarried was also reported The easy
accessibility of healthcare services was reported to
go for abortion Women desired confidentiality
while resorting to abort the child Some women
also reported unprofessional methods of
abortion
As a result of not conceiving soon after marriage
women sought advice and treatment from faith
healers and unqualified healthcare providers
Women believed in fate spirits witchcraft or the
evil eye that determined their ability to
conceive Faced embarrassment at the idea of
seeking treatment for infertility Information
access cost availability accessibility waiting
time navigating healthcare facilities and
unavailability of trained staff were some of the
factors to avail the healthcare services It also
dependent on familiarity of healthcare staff
Participants were discouraged by false
commitments or threats indifferent attitude of

size completion and was considered as necessary
and inevitable one time no fear of pregnancy
once the family size is complete Women
expressed fear of side effects and
misconceptions cumbersome to use irreversible
modern contraceptives Male sterilisation was not
a favoured option as it was considered to cause
loss of vitality or impotency Some considered
contraceptives or sterilisation use against their
religion There was lack of information on use
disposal access and cost of condoms
Participants felt condoms hinders sexual
pleasure and associated it with extra marital
sex Some participants trusted traditional or
natural methods of birth control such as coitus
interruptus rhythm method abstinence and sex
during menstruation These methods were
encouraged by faith healers and were simple
healthy and economical and had no side
effects
Our review participants comprehended inter pregnancy spacing in
tervals however intention of using contraceptives was not corre
sponded One of the major decision making factors for FP use was
husband s support but regrettably most of the women received meagre
support from husbands and mothers in law Majority of the women
complied with the husband s decision but some women took the risk of
going against the family s decision and secretly resorted to using con
traceptives and as a result lived with a fear of getting caught Women
remain at socially disadvantaged positions due to gender inequality and
lack of decision making power related to number and timing of child
birth FP not only addresses the unmet contraceptive needs but also
helps in overcoming gender equity and equality and growth of the in
dividual society and country
There were misconceptions about using FP methods in general
across the country disapproval regarding religious and socio cultural
norms and paradox related to men s attitude Similar findings were re
ported by reviews conducted among and younger than years
aged women Furthermore we found that female sterilisation was the
most utilised method of contraception once the desired family size was
reached Aforesaid finding was consistent with Indian data wherein
female sterilisation accounted for three out of four modern contracep
tive uses Women s preference to use sterilisation could be due to fear
of using reversible methods of contraception and partly because of In
dia s history of FP programs Indian FP program through its inception
mostly focused on limiting the family size by encouraging women to
adopt permanent sterilisation methods Additionally history of coercive
male sterilisation during might have created a lasting fear among the
people Although the program received multiple modifications it is
deeply rooted in people s mind which may be the reason for favouring
female sterilisation Furthermore high female sterilisation might be
related to associated reasons of not favouring temporary modern con
traceptives as described below
Our review demonstrated the difficulties in complying with oral
contraceptive pill OCP regimen Participants associated the use of
condoms with extra marital sex commercial sex and sexual transmitted
diseases which hindered its use Women had lack of agency or control
over condom use as it was considered a male contraceptive Almost all
the studies reported fear of side effects of contraception due to prior
experience or heard from others especially IUDs and OCPs therefore
they were inclined to use traditional methods of contraception Similar
findings were reported by other reviews
In there were about
Indian women who had unmet contraceptive needs and women
practiced traditional methods of contraception
Some of our review participants opted for induced abortion for un
planned pregnancy as a result of unmet FP Inclination for induced

use
above or lack of awareness related to FP Our findings are compatible
with quantitative studies conducted in India and further provide the
perceptions of women for its inclination As discussed in the back
ground induced abortion is associated with adverse health condition as
well as social stigma due to which many women hide abortion history
Our review highlights the FP service use among drug addicts and
PLHIV The possible reason behind this could be effective contraceptive
choice counselling among high risk populations for preventing sexually
transmitted infections However the findings based on the general
population reported that condom use was considered as a barrier to
sexual pleasure This underscores the urgent need of a health literacy
program by developing both the skills and mind set about its proper
use One of the included studies in our review reported the atrocities
faced by indigenous people in Chhattisgarh due to FP policy change
government order Nevertheless it is important to note that
Chhattisgarh High Court quashed this order in as the order was
violating human rights
In general our review participants had credibility issues on gov
ernment health facilities due to various reasons such as the attitude of
the healthcare professionals which is coherent with the conflict theory
of decision making Similar to our findings accessibility economic
reasons social stigma and prejudices of healthcare providers were the
main reason for not accessing FP services However not utilising pro
fessional healthcare services eventually intensifies the risk of medical
complications
Gender of the attending doctor was found to be
another factor influencing utilisation of healthcare service in another
review but we did not come across any such finding in our review
Strengths and weakness
As our systematic review considered wider ethnic cultural and
geographic regions it increases the scope of taking a broader view of the
findings Additionally we have considered perceptions of men and
mothers in law to get an extensive representation Quantitative studies
often cannot find the underlying reasons for a particular outcome
nevertheless our review reduces the gap reported by by
comprehensively identifying the reasons for almost all the FP related
concepts in India Furthermore these reasons are explained using the
WHO framework for social determinates of health
Despite commonalities in overarching themes we cannot apply the
findings to population belonging to a higher socio economic stratum
because of paucity of data in this group of people Almost of In
dia s population reside in villages therefore findings can be general
ised to a larger population of the country We paid more importance to
the experiences and perceptions of people compared to the methodo
logical issues of the included studies Additionally we could not cate
gorise the studies based on study quality as measured using Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme checklist Additional file therefore we did
not use it while generating the findings of the review Most of the
included studies did not report qualitative methodologies appropriately
e g type of qualitative data details on analysis positionality and
reflexivity of researchers therefore we suggest future researchers to
follow standard reporting guidelines and report a methodology that is
reproducible Furthermore due to resource constraint we restricted the
studies to English language

Innovative strategies and research Our findings suggest that condi

the uptake of sterilisation as the money provided was minimal and
was spent on medicines Therefore we suggest more research on to
identify culturally and economically viable methods to increase the

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Equitable access to contraception is critical for reproductive autonomy Using cross sectional data from the
DocStyIes survey administered September October response rate we compared changes in family
planning related clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during the COVID pandemic
and assessed service provision issues among U S physicians whose practice provided family planning
services just before the pandemic About one fifth of those whose practices provided the following services or
strategies just before the pandemic discontinued these services during the pandemic long acting reversible
contraception LARC placement LARC removal providing or prescribing emergency contraceptive
pills ECPs in advance and reminding patients about contraception injections or LARC removal or
replacement Many practices not providing the following services or strategies just before the pandemic
initiated these services during the pandemic telehealth for contraception initiation telehealth for
contraception continuation and renewing contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit
While a smaller proportion of physicians reported service provision issues in the month before survey
completion than at any point during the pandemic about one third still reported fewer adult females seeking
care and technical challenges with telehealth Discontinuation of key family planning services
during the COVID pandemic may limit contraception access and impede reproductive autonomy Imple
menting healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the need for in person visits e g telehealth for
contraception providing or prescribing ECPs in advance may decrease disruptions in care Resources exist for
public health and clinical efforts to ensure contraception access during the pandemic

Although many of
these strategies reduce the need for in person visits clinic visits remain
necessary for LARC insertion and removal if desired by patients and
these services may be particularly impacted by the pandemic
Nevertheless evidence suggests the COVID pandemic has dis

three U S women reported that contraceptive or other reproductive
health visits were delayed or cancelled or that they experienced chal

vey a web based panel survey of U S healthcare providers commis
sioned by Porter Novelli Public Services http styles porternovelli co
m and administered September by SERMO
http www sermo com The survey which contained questions
assessed healthcare provider attitudes and practices on a broad range of
health topics including family planning service provision just before
and during the COVID pandemic
Study sample
Respondents were sampled from SERMO s Global Medical Panel of
medical professionals Quotas were predetermined to reach pri
mary care physicians obstetrician gynecologists pediatricians
and nurse practitioners or physician assistants Invitations to
participate were sent via email Participation was voluntary
Preventive Medicine
Respondents were paid an honorarium of for completing the
survey depending on the number of questions they were asked The
family planning service provision questions were fielded with primary
care physicians obstetrician gynecologists and pediatricians The
overall response rate was by physician specialty response rates
were for primary care physicians for obstetrician
gynecologists and for pediatricians
Measures
Nine questions were added to the Fall DocStyIes survey to
examine family planning service delivery during the pandemic Physi
cians were asked how many female patients of reproductive age
years for whom their practice provided family planning services per
week just before the COVID pandemic Those providing family
planning services were asked about practice level clinical services pro
vided and strategies used assessed separately at two different time
points just before and at any point during the COVID pandemic
Clinical practices assessed included LARC placement LARC removal
telehealth for contraception initiation and telehealth for contraception
continuation Clinical strategies assessed included accepted self report
of blood pressure during telehealth visits for contraception renewed
contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit allowed
curbside pickup or mail delivery of contraception supported self
administration of subcutaneous injectable contraception counseled on
extending use of LARC beyond their FDA approved duration provided
or prescribed ECPs in advance provided or prescribed a year s worth of
oral contraceptives and sent patient reminders about DMPA depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate injections or LARC removal or replace
ment Additionally physicians were asked about specific practice level
issues experienced related to providing family planning or sexually
transmitted infection STI services because of the COVID pandemic
at two different time points at any point during the pandemic and in the
month before survey completion Issues assessed included fewer adult
females seeking care clinic closed for in person appointments LARC
placement services limited LARC removal services limited decreases in
contraceptive supplies technical challenges with telehealth confiden
tiality concerns with telehealth billing challenges with telehealth and
patient discomfort with telehealth The survey also collected informa
tion on provider and clinical practice characteristics
Statistical analysis
Of physicians who completed the survey we excluded
whose practice did not provide family planning services to female pa
tients of reproductive age just before the pandemic resulting in an an
alytic sample of physicians
We described physician and clinical practice characteristics of re
spondents We also described practice level family planning related
clinical services provided and strategies used just before and at any
point during the COVID pandemic and practice level service provi
Sion issues experienced because of the COVID pandemic at any point
during the pandemic and in the month before survey completion We
used the McNemar s test of dependent proportions Fagerland et al
to compare estimates by time period i e just before and at any
point during the COVID pandemic for clinical services provided and
strategies used and at any point during the COVID pandemic and in
the month before survey completion for service provision issues expe
rienced We considered findings with a p value as statistically
significant Additionally among physicians who reported their practice
provided the clinical service or used the strategy just before the
pandemic we examined the proportion who reported their practice
discontinued the service or strategy during the pandemic i e did not
provide at any point during the pandemic Similarly among physicians
who reported their practice did not provide the clinical service or did not
use the strategy just before the pandemic we examined the proportion

Discussion
We found many changes in family planning clinical services when
comparing service delivery before and during the pandemic and some
Preventive Medicine
differences by physician type We observed slight decreases in the pro
portion of physicians overall whose practices provided LARC services
reflecting physicians whose practices offered LARC services before but
discontinued these services during the pandemic Approximately one in
five physicians surveyed whose practices provided other key routine
contraception practices just before the pandemic reported practice
level discontinuation of these practices during the pandemic e g
providing or prescribing ECPs in advance and sending patient reminders
about DMPA injections or LARC removal or replacement We observed
increases in the proportion of physicians whose practices used service
delivery approaches that improve access and reduce the need for in
person visits i e telehealth for contraception accepted self report of
blood pressure during telehealth visits for contraception renewed
contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit and curb
side pickup or mail delivery of contraception reflecting physicians
whose practices did not offer these services before but initiated these
services during the pandemic The physicians surveyed also experienced
practice level service provision issues during the pandemic e g fewer
adult females seeking care clinic closed for in person appointments
While a smaller proportion of physicians reported these issues in the
month before survey completion compared with at any point during the
pandemic about one third still reported fewer adult females seeking
care
We observed low availability of LARC services both before and
during the pandemic A core component of quality family planning
services is patient access to a broad range of contraceptive methods
including LARC Gavin et al As part of providing patient
centered care and supporting individual reproductive autonomy ac
cess to in person visits for LARC placement and removal services is
needed if LARC services are desired by patients Access to LARC
methods which are highly effective Trussell et al and have few
medical contraindications for use Curtis et al
might be
particularly important during the pandemic given possible changes in
attitudes toward contraception One study found that one in four women
overall and one in two women with concerns about reduced access to
contraception reported thinking more about getting a LARC method
because of the pandemic Lindberg et al
Only one in three physicians surveyed reported their practices pro
vided or prescribed ECPs in advance both before and during the
pandemic despite evidence based guidance supporting advance pro
vision of ECPs so they can be taken as soon as possible after unprotected
sexual intercourse Curtis et al This finding may be because
levonorgestrel ECPs are available over the counter in the United States
and physicians may not perceive that they have an important role
ensuring patient access to emergency contraception However despite
over the counter access barriers to ECPs remain including stocking
issues and confusion about access requirements
Upadhya
Emergency contraception is an important backup contraceptive option
and might have increased salience during the COVID pandemic
because of potential pandemic related contraception access barriers
A promising finding from our analysis is use of telehealth for
contraception care in line with recommendations to offer telehealth
services during the pandemic Centers for Disease Control and Preven
Our analysis found that more than half of physicians
tion CDC
surveyed reported providing telehealth for both contraception initiation
and continuation at some point during the pandemic reflecting signif
icant increases compared with just before the pandemic These findings
are similar to prior surveys of family planning providers that found
increased provision of telehealth services for contraception during the
COVID pandemic Stifani et al Weigel et al
Never
theless recent medical claims data have shown that while telehealth
services have grown rapidly during the pandemic these services were
not sufficient to offset drops in in person visits Cox and Amin
Moreover providers have reported challenges with telehealth including
technical difficulties inability to conduct physical exams and diagnostic
testing and lack of guidance on telehealth best practices Stifani et al
L B Zapata et al
Weigel et al
In our survey although physicians reported
fewer practice level telehealth issues in the month before survey
completion compared with at any point during the pandemic suggesting
gained experience implementing telehealth over time nearly one in
three continued to report technical challenges with telehealth and
approximately one in five continued to report confidentiality concerns
billing challenges and patient discomfort with telehealth Confidenti
ality concerns with telehealth remained a particular issue for pediatri
cians Resources are available to support family planning service
delivery through telehealth including information on providing person
centered care workflow best practices billing and online pharmacies

Limitations
Our findings are subject to several limitations Respondents were
sampled from a volunteer panel of medical professionals and sampling
was not random or population based As such findings are not gener
alizable to the U S population of primary care physicians pediatricians
and obstetrician gynecologists and statistical inferences should be
interpreted with caution No information was collected about non
respondents so we are unable to determine how respondents and non
respondents differed with respect to family planning service provision
Data are based on physician self report of practice level experiences and
some responses may be inaccurate due to recall social desirability or
other types of reporting error We assessed clinical practices used at any
point during the COVID pandemic rather than routine provision or
provision at different time points during the pandemic e g early versus
later months as such findings may overestimate initiation and un
derestimate discontinuation of practices during the pandemic Also
related to discontinuation of practices we do not know if discontinua
tion occurred because of the physician regardless of patient demand or
because of a lack of patients seeking services Assessment of service
provision issues experienced was related to providing family planning or
STI services so we do not know with certainty that issues reported were
specific to family planning service delivery We focused on contracep
tion services in this analysis but acknowledge that family planning
services include a wider range of services such as pregnancy testing and
counseling basic infertility services and STI screening and treatment
Gavin et al Last we only assessed experiences of physicians
Preventive Medicine
who reported providing family planning services to female patients of
reproductive age and recognize that physicians may also provide these
services to individuals not identifying as female
Conclusions
Discontinuation of key family planning services during the COVID
pandemic may limit contraception access which may impede
reproductive autonomy and contribute to unintended pregnancies
Implementing healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the
need for in person visits e g telehealth for contraception initiation and
continuation curbside pickup or mail delivery of contraception
providing or prescribing ECPs in advance providing or prescribing a
year s worth of contraception may decrease disruptions in care Re
sources exist for public health and clinical efforts to ensure contracep
tion access during the pandemic

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective Pregnancy among systemic lupus erythematosus SLE affected women is highly associated
with poor obstetric outcomes Predicting the risk of foetal outcome is essential for maximizing the success
of pregnancy This study aimed to develop a clinical decision support system CDSS to predict pregnancy
outcomes among SLE affected pregnant women
Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of pregnant women with SLE who were followed
at Shariati Hospital pregnancies and a specialized clinic pregnancies from to We
selected significant features p O IO using a binary logistic regression model performed in IBM SPSS
version Afterward we trained several artificial neural networks multi layer perceptron MLP and
radial basis function RBFI to predict the pregnancy outcome In order to evaluate and select the most
effective network we used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve
We finally developed a CDSS based on the most accurate network MATLAB software was applied
to design the neural networks and develop the CDSS
Results Initially potential variables were analysed by the binary logistic regression and effective
features were selected as the inputs of neural networks P value The accuracy sensitivity
and specificity of the test data for the MLP network were achieved These measures for
the RBF network were and respectively Having applied a fold cross validation
method the accuracy for the networks showed accuracy for RBF and accuracy for MLP
Therefore the MLP network was selected as the most accurate network for prediction of pregnancy
outcome
Conclusion The developed CDSS based on the MLP network can help physicians to predict pregnancy
outcomes in women with SLE
Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE is a chronic autoimmune
disease with a worldwide distribution SLE as an inflammatory
multi system disease with unknown aetiology has different clini

loss has decreased significantly from in the to in
the early in SLE affected women
Although in recent
years foetal survival has increased due to better understanding
of the causes of abortion in SLE patients and better therapeutic
approaches
foetal loss continues to be higher among SLE
affected women than the normal population Overall about

women where the pregnancy loss rate is Generally the
incidence of spontaneous abortion is approximately among
SLE affected women while it is in the normal population
Special gynaecological and rheumatological care is necessary to
increase the chance of pregnancy success Regarding the impor
tance of pregnancy outcomes pregnancy in SLE patients should
be planned in advance and the patients should be monitored
before and during the pregnancy However decision making
and prediction of pregnancy outcomes in SLE patients is a complex
task for physicians A variety of factors with different degrees of
effectiveness may affect the outcome of pregnancy in SLE affected
women In addition non linear relationships between these fac
tors and the outcome of pregnancy may result in more complexities

useful tools for solving sophisticated problems A CDSS is designed
to help healthcare providers make timely decisions about their
patients These systems can be developed based on the experts
knowledge historical data analysis or clinical evidence
In this regard a variety of algorithms such as neural networks
fuzzy logic regression Bayesian networks or a combination of
these algorithms have been successfully applied in different fields
of clinical practices
Prediction of pregnancy outcomes for SLE patients can notice
ably contribute towards providing effective health consulting
and therapeutic services as well as prevent undesirable out
comes and physical and psychological complications resulting
from an abortion
Considering the importance of influ
ential factors on the outcome of pregnancy risk factors many
studies have been conducted worldwide to identify these fac
tors For example factors such as high blood pressure lupus
nephritis thrombosis anti phospholipid antibodies flare up of
lupus during six months before pregnancy anti cardiolipin anti
bodies lupus anti coagulant anaemia leucopoenia age at time
of conception history of abortion the number of children and
many other factors have been introduced in previous studies
The numerous risk factors and the com
plexity of relationships among these risk factors necessitate the
development of a CDSS Application of CDSS in maternal care in
developing countries has been previously reported
how
ever to the best of our knowledge no CDSS has been developed
to support physicians in predicting the outcome of pregnancy in
SLE affected women Therefore in this study we developed and
evaluated a CDSS based on an artificial neural network ANN appli
cation
Material and methods
Data source and data collection
In order to identify the potential variables we first conducted
a literature review and an interview with a rheumatologist We
used this search strategy to find related literature systemic lupus
erythematosus OR SLE AND predictor OR risk factor AND preg
nancy outcome OR foetal loss in PubMed Scopus and Google
Scholar We selected related articles published in English from
In addition we considered local evidence and rheumatol
ogist consultations We identified potential variables in this
regard however five of these variables anti Ro ss A and anti
La ss B antibodies anti glycoprotein I antibody anti
serum albumin level and antihypertensive use were mostly not
recorded in the patients records Therefore we collected data for
the other variables The needed data was retrospectively col
lected from the medical records of SLE affected pregnant women
who had visited a specialized hospital Shariati Hospital and a spe
cialized clinic in Tehran Iran from to We also used the
database of these cases in the Rheumatology Research Center to
collect some required data elements that were not available in the
medical records A trained researcher the first author extracted
the data from the medical records and the database
Out of registered pregnancies the medical records of only
of these pregnancies were available and eligible for analysis
from the hospital and from the specialized clinic The final
dataset included the possible influential factors and pregnancy
outcomes of the cases
Pre processing and feature selection
The outcome of pregnancy had four categories first trimester
spontaneous abortion second trimester spontaneous abortion
and preterm and term live birth We re classified these categories
into two classes spontaneous abortion and live birth
There was data missing for some variables One of the
approaches for resolving such a problem is using the mean or
mode of the variable for all samples belonging to the same class
This approach has been applied in previous studies
There
fore we also replaced missing values by the mean of each class for
numeric values and the mode of each class for non numeric values
Multiplicity ofthe variables features may result in overtraining
a model Therefore one of the most commonly used pre processing
techniques is dimension reduction or feature selection In this
regard irrelevant weakly relevant or less important features are
removed
Feature selection may improve the accuracy of the
resulting model Researchers have applied a variety of techniques
for this purpose
For this end we used the binary logistic
regression method through IBM SPSS software version Sixteen
important features P value O IO were finally selected as inputs
to train the neural networks
Designing neural networks
We selected ANNs as our training algorithms because these net
works have been successfully applied to develop a CDSS for many
situations in healthcare
and ANNs usually perform better than
statistical methods
We used the selected features from the previous step as the
inputs of the ANN Inputs were normalized before being entered in
networks by using the min max method We developed two differ
ent models of ANN including a feedforward multilayer perceptron
MLP network with a scaled conjugate gradient trainscg back
propagation learning algorithm and a radial basis function RBF
network with a Levenberg Marquardt trainlm back propagation
learning algorithm using MATLAB software The learning
algorithm for MLP and RBF neural networks can be mentioned using
the generalized delta rule and gradient descent because they have
nonlinear activation functions Using a back propagation algorithm
in the procedure of learning requires the change in weight made by
the gradient descent rule
During the procedure of learning
in neural networks an epoch is accomplished when all the training
examples are presented to the network and are processed using the
learning algorithm only once

with different topologies were trained and the performance of each
network was assessed based on the testing validation and train
ing dataset application For training the MLP network the dataset
was randomly split into training validation and test
ing data For the RBF network we randomly split the dataset
into training and testing data
Evaluation of the networks and development of the CDSS
In order to evaluate and select the most accurate network we
used a confusion matrix and calculated the percentage of sensi
tivity specificity and accuracy of each network In addition the
performance of the networks was evaluated by the receiver oper
ating characteristic ROC curve and the area under the ROC curve
AUC Maximizing AUC indicates a satisfying classification
In addition for the selected MLP and RBF networks we used fold
cross validation too All calculations were based on the standard
equations published elsewhere
Finally we developed the
CDSS based on the most accurate network MATLAB software
was applied to design the CDSS

Discussion
Predicting the outcome of pregnancy in women with SLE and
providing proper and effective care for these patients can increase
the expectancy of foetal survival for families However predict
ing this problem is still complicated because of the multiplicity
of affecting variables and the complexity of their relationships
with regard to this problem We developed a CDSS for predict
ing pregnancy outcomes among SLE affected women We applied
two neural networks for this prediction According to the results
accuracy of MLP and RBF networks for the test data was and
respectively In addition the MLP outperformed RBF net
works using the total data
Although to the best of our knowledge there are no other
studies related to developing models using neural networks or
other machine learning algorithms for predicting the pregnancy
outcomes of SLE affected women researchers successfully applied
neural networks for either multivariate analysis or predicting a
range of diseases or for disease risk estimation
According to
the previous research the performance of the classification algo
rithms especially neural networks may be different from one

dataset to another
However in most studies in which the
performance of different neural networks has been compared the
MLP network performance was better than the others in the field
of prediction task of medicine a result that is consistent with our
findings For example a study was conducted by Bovis et al to iden
tify masses in digital mammograms using both the MLP and the
RBF based on Gaussian kernels networks in the UK This study
revealed that the MLP network with the best performance showed
an AUC value of in contrast to the AUC value of RBF
In addition Kurt et al compared the performance of classification
methods in order to predict the presence of coronary artery dis
ease CAD and found that areas under the ROC curves were
and for MLP logistic regression LR clas
sification and regression tree CART and RBF respectively
The
better accuracy of the MLP networks has been confirmed for pre
dicting and classifying other medical conditions such as internal
carotid arteries ICA stenosis vs middle cerebral
artery MCA stenosis vs and thyroid diseases
based on different learning algorithms vs
However there are studies indicating that RBF performance may
be somewhat better than the MLP in some areas such as predict
ing the risk of essential hypertension disease vs
Therefore researchers should avoid making a conclusion based on
only one method The decision of a method selection should be
made based on a comparison between different methods applied
to a specific dataset
As our results indicate the MLP network with a scaled
conjugate gradient trainscg back propagation learning algorithm
with accuracy had the best performance The network con
sisted of sigmoid functions and neurons in the single hidden
layer and a log sigmoid function and one neuron in the output
layer Therefore we applied this model to develop a CDSS
The risk of undesirable foetal outcomes estimation in the early
first trimester of pregnancy by rheumatologists may guarantee
a desirable pregnancy outcome When an SLE affected pregnant
woman is visited for the first time by a rheumatologist the lat
ter enters the values of effective factors into the developed
which then predicts the outcome of the pregnancy
CDSS
Fig
in two classes spontaneous abortion and live birth by a click on
the button for pregnancy outcome in the designed system In this
way the rheumatologist can decide optimally about the patient
and her treatment While the system predicts spontaneous abor
tion for one case that case should be considered as high risk
In this setting the expert rheumatologist can start to manage the
pregnancy more skilfully to have a favourable outcome in these
high risk pregnancies by regular monitoring and the recommen
dation to take appropriate medications during pregnancy adjusted
to the patient s medical history and risk factors
It is generally
accepted that systematic monitoring is needed for all SLE affected
women to improve their pregnancy outcome
Thus more fre
quent specific care and interventions are required for the mothers
for whom the system predicts spontaneous abortion rather than
those for whom the system predicts live birth this may ensure
correct planning and management of care for these patients
In addition many women with SLE discontinue their medications
when they find themselves pregnant
Thereby awareness of
the risk for the mothers can help to manage the condition prop
erly with regard to alterations in their medications and appropriate
counselling by some recommended continuation and discontinu
ation of the medications
Therefore rheumatologists can
decrease the effect of specific factors associated with incidence
of spontaneous abortion in SLE affected women until delivery by
specifically maintaining and monitoring the mother It can improve
the health of the mother and maximize the chances of a successful
delivery
Hence this system may be effective to reduce
the risk of foetal loss
Some limitations should be considered in this research Most
cases of pregnant patients with SLE were excluded due to a large
quantity of missing data in their medical records or the related
databases Therefore the results may not be generalizable In addi
tion we could not access data about five variables anti Ro ss A
and anti La ss B antibodies anti glycoprotein I antibody anti
serum albumin level and antihypertensive use Finally we
removed these five variables Therefore conducting similar studies
with a larger dataset is recommended
In this study we replaced missing data Although this approach
is a standard pre processing technique it might result in bias We
re built the selected MLP network without replacing any missing
data According to the results the accuracy of this new network
was
In addition we first identified important features based on the
literature review and then selected the most important ones using
logistic regression For comparison we re developed the network
without any feature selection The results indicated that the accu
racy sensitivity and specificity of this new network were
and respectively These results show that the network

Physiological changes in pregnancy
Priya Soma Pillay Catherine Nelson Piercy Heli Tolppanen Alexandre Mebazaa
Abstract
Physiological changes occur in pregnancy to nurture the
developing foetus and prepare the mother for labour and
delivery Some of these changes influence normal biochemical
values while others may mimic symptoms of medical disease
It is important to differentiate between normal physiological
changes and disease pathology This review highlights the
important changes that take place during normal pregnancy

During pregnancy the pregnant mother undergoes significant
anatomical and physiological changes in order to nurture and
accommodate the developing foetus These changes begin after
conception and affect every organ system in the body l For
most women experiencing an uncomplicated pregnancy these
changes resolve after pregnancy with minimal residual effects
It is important to understand the normal physiological changes
occurring in pregnancy as this will help differentiate from
adaptations that are abnormal
Haematological changes
Plasma volume increases progressively throughout normal
pregnancy Most of this increase occurs by weeks

gestation and is proportional to the birthweight of the baby
Because the expansion in plasma volume is greater than the
increase in red blood cell mass there is a fall in haemoglobin
concentration haematocrit and red blood cell count Despite this
haemodilution there is usually no change in mean corpuscular
volume MCV or mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration
MCHC
The platelet count tends to fall progressively during normal
pregnancy although it usually remains within normal limits
In a proportion of women the count will reach levels
of x cells l by term and this occurs in the absence
of any pathological process In practice therefore a woman is
not considered to be thrombocytopenic in pregnancy until the
platelet count is less than x cells l
Pregnancy causes a two to three fold increase in the
requirement for iron not only for haemoglobin synthesis but
also for for the foetus and the production of certain enzymes
There is a to fold increase in folate requirements and a
two fold increase in the requirement for vitamin BE
Changes in the coagulation system during pregnancy
produce a physiological hypercoagulable state in preparation
for haemostasis following delivery The concentrations
of certain clotting factors particularly VIII IX and X are
increased Fibrinogen levels rise significantly by up to and
fibrinolytic activity is decreased Concentrations of endogenous
anticoagulants such as antithrombin and protein S decrease
Thus pregnancy alters the balance within the coagulation system
in favour of clotting predisposing the pregnant and postpartum
woman to venous thrombosis This increased risk is present from
the first trimester and for at least weeks following delivery In
vitro tests of coagulation activated partial thromboplastin time
APT T prothrombin time PT and thrombin time TT remain
normal in the absence of anticoagulants or a coagulopathy
Venous stasis in the lower limbs is associated with venodilation
and decreased flow which is more marked on the left This is due
to compression of the left iliac vein by the left iliac artery and
the ovarian artery On the right the iliac artery does not cross
the vein
Cardiac changes
Changes in the cardiovascular system in pregnancy are profound
and begin early in pregnancy such that by eight weeks gestation
the cardiac output has already increased by The primary
event is probably peripheral vasodilatation This is mediated
by endothelium dependent factors including nitric oxide
synthesis upregulated by oestradiol and possibly vasodilatory
prostaglandins Peripheral vasodilation leads to a
fall in systemic vascular resistance and to compensate for this
cardiac output increases by around during pregnancy This
is achieved predominantly via an increase in stroke volume but
also to a lesser extent an increase in heart rate The maximum
cardiac output is found at about weeks gestation There is
a minimal fall at term
CARDIOVASCULAR JOURNAL OF AFRICA Volume No March April
An increase in stroke volume is possible due to the early
increase in ventricular wall muscle mass and end diastolic
volume but not end diastolic pressure seen in pregnancy The
heart is physiologically dilated and myocardial contractility
is increased Although stroke volume declines towards term
the increase in maternal heart rate bpm is maintained
thus preserving the increased cardiac output Blood pressure
decreases in the first and second trimesters but increases to
non pregnant levels in the third trimester
There is a profound effect of maternal position towards
term upon the haemodynamic profile of both the mother and
foetus In the supine position pressure of the gravid uterus on
the inferior vena cava IVC causes a reduction in venous return
to the heart and a consequent fall in stroke volume and cardiac
output Turning from the lateral to the supine position may
result in a reduction in cardiac output Pregnant women
should therefore be nursed in the left or right lateral position
wherever possible If the woman has to be kept on her back
the pelvis should be rotated so that the uterus drops to the side
and off the IVC and cardiac output and uteroplacental blood
flow are optimised Reduced cardiac output is associated with
a reduction in uterine blood flow and therefore in placental
perfusion which could compromise the foetus
Although both blood volume and stroke volume increase
in pregnancy pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central
venous pressure do not increase significantly Pulmonary vascular
resistance PVR like systemic vascular resistance SVR
decreases significantly in normal pregnancy Although there is no
increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure PCWP serum
colloid osmotic pressure is reduced by The colloid
osmotic pressure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure gradient
is reduced by about making pregnant women particularly
susceptible to pulmonary oedema Pulmonary oedema will be
precipitated if there is either an increase in cardiac pre load
such as infusion of fluids or increased pulmonary capillary
permeability such as in pre eclampsia or both
Labour is associated with further increases in cardiac output
in the first stage and in the second stage Uterine
contractions lead to an auto transfusion of ml of blood
back into the circulation and the sympathetic response to pain
and anxiety further elevate the heart rate and blood pressure
Cardiac output is increased between contractions but more so
during contractions
Following delivery there is an immediate rise in cardiac
output due to relief of the inferior vena cava obstruction and
contraction of the uterus which empties blood into the systemic
circulation Cardiac output increases by followed by
a rapid decline to pre labour values within about one hour of
delivery Transfer of fluid from the extravascular space increases
venous return and stroke volume further
Those women with cardiovascular compromise are therefore
most at risk of pulmorary oedema during the second stage of
labour and the immediate postpartum period Cardiac output
has nearly returned to normal pre pregnancy values two
weeks after delivery although some pathological changes e g
hypertension in pre eclampsia may take much longer
The above physiological changes lead to changes on
cardiovascular examination that may be misinterpreted as
pathological by those unfamiliar with pregnancy Changes may
include a bounding or collapsing pulse and an ejection systolic
murmur present in over of pregnant women The murmur
may be loud and audible all over the precordium with the first
heart sound loud and possibly sometimes a third heart sound
There may be ectopic beats and peripheral oedema
Normal findings on ECG in pregnancy that may partly relate
to changes in the position of the heart include
atrial and ventricular ectopics
Q wave small and inverted T wave in lead III
ST segment depression and T wave inversion in the inferior
and lateral leads
left axis shift of QRS
Adaptive changes in renal vasculature
The primary adaptive mechanism in pregnancy is a marked fall
in systemic vascular resistance SVR occurring by week six of
gestation The fall in SVR also affects the renal vasculature
Despite a major increase in plasma volume during pregnancy the
massive decrease in SVR creates a state of arterial under filling
because of the volume resides in the venous circulation
This arterial under filling state is unique to pregnancy The fall
in SVR is combined with increased renal blood flow and this is in
contrast to other states of arterial under filling such as cirrhosis
sepsis or arterio venous fistulas
Relaxin a peptide hormone produced by the corpus luteum
decidua and placenta plays an important role in the regulation
of haemodynamic and water metabolism during pregnancy
Serum concentrations of relaxin already elevated in the luteal
phase of the menstrual cycle rise after conception to a peak at
the end of the first trimester and fall to an intermediate value
throughout the second and third trimester Relaxin stimulates
the formation of endothelin which in turn mediates vasodilation
of renal arteries via nitric oxide NO synthesis
Despite activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone
RAA system in early pregnancy a simultaneous relative
resistance to angiotensin II develops counterbalancing the
vasoconstrictive effect and allowing profound vasodilatation
This insensitivity to angiotensin II may be explained by the
effects of progesterone and vascular endothelial growth factor
mediated prostacyclin production as well as modifications in
the angiotensin I receptors during pregnancy The vascular
refractoriness to angiotensin II may also be shared by other
vasoconstrictors such as adrenergic agonists and arginine
vasopressin AVP IO It is possible that in the second half of
pregnancy the placental vasodilatators are more important in
the maintenance of the vasodilatatory state
Changes in renal anatomy and function
As a consequence of renal vasodilatation renal plasma flow
and glomerular filtration rate GFR both increase compared
to non pregnant levels by and respectively In
addition the increase in plasma volume causes decreased oncotic
pressure in the glomeruli with a subsequent rise in GFR II
Vascular resistance decreases in both the renal afferent and
efferent arterioles and therefore despite the massive increase in
renal plasma flow glomerular hydrostatic pressure remains stable
avoiding the development of glomerular hypertension As the
GFR rises both serum creatinine and urea concentrations decrease
to mean values of about gmol l and mmol l respectively
CARDIOVASCULAR JOURNAL OF AFRICA Volume No March April
The increased renal blood flow leads to an increase in renal
size of cm reaching the maximal size by mid pregnancy
The kidney pelvis and calyceal systems dilate due to mechanical
compressive forces on the ureters Progesterone which reduces
ureteral tone peristalsis and contraction pressure mediates these
anatomical changes II The increase in renal size is associated with
an increase in renal vasculature interstitial volume and urinary
dead space There is also dilation of the ureters renal pelvis
and calyces leading to physiological hydronephrosis in over
of women There is often a right sided predominance of
hydronephrosis due to the anatomical circumstances of the right
ureter crossing the iliac and ovarian vessels at an angle before
entering the pelvis Urinary stasis in the dilated collecting system
predisposes pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria to
pyelonephritis
There are also alterations in the tubular handling of wastes
and nutrients As in the non pregnant state glucose is freely
filtered in the glomerulus During pregnancy the reabsorption of
glucose in the proximal and collecting tubule is less effective with
variable excretion About of pregnant women with normal
blood glucose levels excrete g of glucose per day Due to the
increases in both GFR and glomerular capillary permeability to
albumin the fractional excretion of protein may increase up to
mg day and protein excretion also increases In normal pregnancies
the total protein concentration in urine does not increase above
the upper normal limit Uric acid excretion also increases due to
increased GFR and or decreased tubular reabsorption II
Body water metabolism
Arterial under filling in pregnancy leads to the stimulation of
arterial baroreceptors activating the RAA and the sympathetic
nervous systems This results in a non osmotic release of AVP
from the hypothalamus These changes lead to sodium and
water retention in the kidneys and create a hypervolaemic hypo
osmolar state characteristic of pregnancy Extracellular volume
increases by and plasma volume by Maternal
blood volume increases by to approximately to
ml above non pregnant values By the late third trimester the
plasma volume increases by more than with a lower
increase in red blood cell mass and therefore plasma osmolality
falls by mosmol kg The increase in plasma volume plays
a critical role in maintaining circulating blood volume blood
pressure and uteroplacental perfusion during pregnancy
Activation of the RAA system leads to increased plasma
levels of aldosterone and subsequent salt and water retention in
the distal tubule and collecting duct In addition to the increased
renin production by the kidneys ovaries and uteroplacental
unit produce an inactive precursor protein of renin in early
pregnancy The placenta also produces oestrogens that
stimulate the synthesis of angiotensinogen by the liver resulting
in proportionally increased levels of aldosterone compared to
renin Plasma levels of aldosterone correlate well with those of
oestrogens and rise progressively during pregnancy The increase
in aldosterone is responsible for the increase in plasma volume
during pregnancy Progesterone which is a potent aldosterone
antagonist allows natriuresis despite the sodium retaining
properties of aldosterone The rise in GFR also increases
distal sodium delivery allowing excretion of excess sodium
Progesterone has antikaliuretic effects and therefore excretion of
potassium is kept constant throughout pregnancy due to changes
in tubular reabsorption and total body potassium increases
during pregnancy
Hypothalamic AVP release increases early in pregnancy as a
result of increased relaxin levels AVP mediates an increase in water
reabsorption via aquaporin channels in the collecting duct The
threshold for hypothalamic secretion of AVP and the threshold
for thirst is reset to a lower plasma osmolality level creating the
hypo osmolar state characteristic of pregnancy These changes are
mediated by human chorionic gonadotropin hCG and relaxin
In middle and late pregnancy there is a four fold increase in
vasopressinase an aminopeptidase produced by the placenta
These changes enhance the metabolic clearance of vasopressin
and regulate the levels of active AVP In conditions of increased
placental production of vasopressinase such as pre eclampsia or
twin pregnancies a transient diabetes insipidus may develop I
As a consequence of this volume expansion the secretion of
atrial natriuretic peptides increases by in the third trimester
and rises further during the first week postpartum The levels of
natriuretic peptides are higher in pregnant women with chronic
hypertension and pre eclampsia
Respiratory changes
There is a significant increase in oxygen demand during normal
pregnancy This is due to a increase in the metabolic rate
and a increased consumption of oxygen There is a
increase in minute ventilation mostly due to an increase in
tidal volume rather than in the respiratory rate This maternal
hyperventilation causes arterial to increase and arterial
to fall with a compensatory fall in serum bicarbonate to
mmol l see Table A mild fully compensated respiratory
alkalosis is therefore normal in pregnancy arterial pH
Diaphragmatic elevation in late pregnancy results in decreased
functional residual capacity but diaphragmatic excursion and
therefore vital capacity remain unaltered Inspiratory reserve
volume is reduced early in pregnancy as a result of increased
tidal volume but increases in the third trimester as a result of
reduced functional residual capacity see Fig Peak expiratory
flow rate PEFR and forced expiratory volume in one second
FEVI are unaffected by pregnancy
Pregnancy may also be accompanied by a subjective feeling of
breathlessness without hypoxia This is physiological and is most
common in the third trimester but may start at any time during
gestation Classically the breathlessness is present at rest or while
talking and may paradoxically improve during mild activity
Adaptive changes in the alimentary tract
Nausea and vomiting are very common complaints in pregnancy
affecting of pregnancies This might be an adaptive

mechanism of pregnancy aiming at preventing pregnant women
from consuming potentially teratogenic substances such as
strong tasting fruits and vegetables The exact underlying
mechanism is not clear but pregnancy associated hormones
such as human chorionic gonadotropin hCG oestrogen and
progesterone could to be involved in the aetiology The levels of
hCG peak at the end of the first trimester when the trophoblast
is most actively producing hCG correlating with the nausea
symptoms Nausea is also more frequent in pregnancies with
high levels of hCG such as in twin pregnancies
Thyroid hormones may also be involved in the development
of nausea symptoms as a strong association with nausea and
abnormal thyroid function tests has been found Thyroid
stimulating hormone TSH and hCG have similar biomolecular
structures and therefore hCG cross reacts with TSH stimulating
the thyroid gland Psychological causes genetic incompatibility
immunological factors nutritional deficiencies as well as
Helicobacter pylori infection have been proposed as aetiological
factors of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy
The nausea symptoms usually resolve by week but
about of the patients experience symptoms beyond
week and some until the end of the pregnancy In most
cases minor dietary modification and observation of electrolyte
balance is sufficient About of pregnant women develop
hyperemesis gravidum a severe form of nausea and excessive
vomiting often resulting in dehydration electrolyte imbalance
ketonuria weight loss and vitamin or mineral deficiencies
In these cases intravenous fluid and vitamin substitution is
commonly required Thiamine supplementation is important in
order to avoid the development of Wernicke s encephalopathy
As pregnancy progresses mechanical changes in the
alimentary tract also occur caused by the growing uterus The
stomach is increasingly displaced upwards leading to an altered
axis and increased intra gastric pressure The oesophageal
sphincter tone is also decreased and these factors may predispose
to symptoms of reflux as well as nausea and vomiting
Changes in oestrogen and progesterone levels also influence
the structural alterations in the gastrointestinal tract These
include abnormalities in gastric neural activity and smooth
muscle function leading to gastic dysrhythmia or gastroparesis

Endocrine changes
Thyroid
There is an increase in the production of thyroxine binding globulin
TBG by the liver resulting in increased levels of thyroxine TO
and tri iodothyronine T Serum free T IT and T levels
are slightly altered but are usually of no clinical significance Levels
of free T and do however decrease slightly in the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy and the normal ranges are reduced
Free T and T are the physiologically important hormones and are
the main determinants of whether a patient is euthyroid
Serum concentrations of TSH are decreased slightly in the
first trimester in response to the thyrotropic effects of increased
levels of human chorionic gonadotropin Levels of TSH increase
again at the end of the first trimester and the upper limit in
pregnancy is raised to gmol l compared with the level of
gmol l in the non pregnant state Table
Pregnancy is associated with a relative iodine deficiency The
causes for this are active transport of iodine from the mother
to the foeto placental unit and increased iodine excretion in the
urine The World Health Organisation recommends an increase
in iodine intake in pregnancy from to mg day If
iodine intake is maintained in pregnancy the size of the thyroid
gland remains unchanged and therefore the presence of goiter
should always be investigated The thyroid gland is larger in
patients who are iodine deficient
Adrenal gland
Three types of steroids are produced by the adrenal glands
mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids and sex steroids The RAA
system is stimulated due to reductions in vascular resistance and
blood pressure causing a three fold increase in aldosterone levels
in the first trimester and a fold increase in the third trimester
Levels of angiotensin II are increased two to four fold and renin
activity is increased three to four times that of non pregnant values
During pregnancy there is also an increase in serum levels
of deoxycorticosterone corticosteroid binding globulin CBG
adrenocorticotropic hormone ACT H cortisol and free cortisol
These changes cause a state of physiological hypercortisolism and
may be clinically manifested by the striae facial plethora rising
blood pressure or impaired glucose tolerance Total cortisol levels
increase at the end of the first trimester and are three times higher
than non pregnant values at the end of pregnancy Hypercortisolism
in late pregnancy is also the result of the production of corticotropin
releasing hormone by the placenta one of the triggers for the onset
of labour Diurnal variations in ACTH and cortisol levels are
maintained The hypothalamic pituitary axis response to exogenous
glucocorticoids is blunted during pregnancy

Pituitary gland
The pituitary gland enlarges in pregnancy and this is mainly due
to proliferation of prolactin producing cells in the anterior lobe
Serum prolactin levels increase in the first trimester and are
times higher at term The increase in prolactin is most likely due
to increasing serum oestradiol concentrations during pregnancy
Levels of follicle stimulating hormone FSH and luteinising
hormone LH are undetectable during pregnancy due to the
negative feedback from elevated levels of oestrogen progesterone
and inhibin Pituitary growth hormone production is decreased
but serum growth hormone levels are increased due to growth
hormone production from the placenta
The posterior pituitary produces oxytocin and arginine
vasopressin AVP Oxytocin levels increase in pregnancy
and peak at term Levels of antidiuretic hormone ADH
remain unchanged but the decrease in sodium concentration in
pregnancy causes a decrease in osmolality There is therefore a
resetting of osmoreceptors for ADH release and thirst
Glucose metabolism
Pregnancy is a diabetogenic state and the adaptations in glucose
metabolism allow shunting of glucose to the foetus to promote
development while maintaining adequate maternal nutrition
Insulin secreting pancreatic beta cells undergo hyperplasia resulting
in increased insulin secretion and increased insulin sensitivity in
early pregnancy followed by progressive insulin resistance
Maternal insulin resistance begins in the second trimester
and peaks in the third trimester This is the result of increasing
secretion of diabetogenic hormones such as human placental
lactogen growth hormone progesterone cortisol and prolactin
These hormones cause a decrease in insulin sensitivity in the
peripheral tissues such as adipocytes and skeletal muscle by
interfering with insulin receptor signalling The effect of
the placental hormones on insulin sensitivity is made evident
postpartum when there is a sudden decrease in insulin resistance
Insulin levels are increased in both the fasting and postprandial
states in pregnancy Fasting glucose levels are however decreased
due to
increased storage of tissue glycogen
increased peripheral glucose use
decrease in glucose production by the liver
uptake of glucose by the foetus
Insulin resistance and relative hypoglycaemia results in lipolysis
allowing the pregnant mother to preferentially use fat for fuel
preserving the available glucose and amino acids for the foetus and
minimising protein catabolism The placenta allows transfer of
glucose amino acids and ketones to the foetus but is impermeable
to large lipids If a woman s endocrine pancreatic function is
impaired and she is unable to overcome the insulin resistance
associated with pregnancy then gestational diabetes develops
Lipid metabolism
There is an increase in total serum cholesterol and triglyceride
levels in pregnancy The increase in triglyceride levels is mainly as a
result of increased synthesis by the liver and decreased lipoprotein
lipase activity resulting in decreased catabolism of adipose tissue
Low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol levels also increase
and reach at term High density lipoprotein levels increase
in the first half of pregnancy and fall in the third trimester but
concentrations are higher than non pregnant levels
Changes in lipid metabolism accommodate the needs of the
developing foetus Increased triglyceride levels provide for the
mother s energy needs while glucose is spared for the foetus
The increase in LDL cholesterol is important for placental
steroidogenesis
Protein metabolism
Pregnant women require an increased intake of protein during
pregnancy Amino acids are actively transported across the
placenta to fulfill the needs of the developing foetus During
pregnancy protein catabolism is decreased as fat stores are used
to provide for energy metabolism
Calcium metabolism
The average foetus requires about g of calcium to maintain its
physiological processes Most of this calcium is transferred to the
foetus during the third trimester and is derived from increased
dietary absorption by the mother There is a decrease in total
serum calcium concentration during pregnancy This is mainly
due to a decrease in serum albumin levels due to haemodilution
resulting in a decrease in the albumin bound fraction of calcium
However the physiologically important fraction serum ionised
calcium remains unchanged Therefore maternal serum levels
of calcium are maintained during pregnancy and foetal needs are
met by increased intestinal absorption which doubles from
weeks gestation However the peak demand for calcium is only
in the third trimester This early increase in calcium absorption
may allow the maternal skeleton to store calcium in advance l
Serum levels of hydroxyvitamin D increase and this is
metabolised further into I dihydroxyvitamin D The increase
in dihydroxyvitamin D is directly responsible for the
increase in intestinal calcium absorption
Increased calcium absorption is associated with an increase in
calcium excretion in the urine and these changes begin from
weeks During periods of fasting urinary calcium values are low
or normal confirming that hypercalciuria is the consequence of
increased absorption Pregnancy is therefore a risk factor for
kidney stones
Skeletal and bone density changes
There is controversy regarding the effect of pregnancy on maternal
bone loss Although pregnancy and lactation are associated with
reversible bone loss studies do not support an association between
parity and osteoporosis in later life Bone turnover is low in the
first trimester and increases in the third trimester when foetal
calcium needs are increased The source of the calcium in the third
trimester is previously stored skeletal calcium
A study of bone biopsies in pregnancy has shown a change
in the micro architectural pattern of bone in pregnancy but not
overall bone mass The changes reflect the need for the maternal
skeleton to be resistant to bending forces and biochemical
stresses needed to carry the growing foetus
Other musculoskeletal changes seen in pregnancy include
exaggerated lordosis of the lower back forward flexion of the
neck and downward movement of the shoulders

Abstract
Objective
The morbidity and mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage has been increased since in China
in addition promoting vaginal delivery is an important task in China currently This study aimed to
develop a clinical decision support system CDSS to predict postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal
delivery women
Design
A retrospective cohort study
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records among vaginal delivery women who had
visited the obstetrics clinic at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from to
these women then were randomly divided into a training set a validation set and a test set
We adopted a univariate logistic regression model to select the significant features P
Afterward we trained several artificial neural networks and binary logistic regression to predict the
postpartum hemorrhage the neural networks included multi layer perceptron MLP back propagation
BP and radial basis function RBF In order to compare and identify the most accurate network we
used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve We finally developed a
clinical decision support system based on the most accurate network All statistical analyses were
performed by IBM SPSS version and MATLAB software was applied to develop the clinical
decision support system
Results
Initially potential variables were addressed by the univariate logistic regression significant
predictors were then selected to enter the binary logistic regression and neural networks P value
After validation the best performing model was the multi layer perceptron network with the highest
discriminative ability AUC Cl Followed by the back propagation model AUC
Cl the logistic regression model AUC Cl The radial
basis function model AUC Cl had lower discriminative ability
Conclusion
Page
In summary in terms of predicting postpartum hemorrhage the multi layer perceptron network performed
better than the back propagation network logistic regression model and radial basis function network
The developed clinical decision support system based on the multi layer perceptron network is expected
to promote early identification of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery women thereby improve the
quality of obstetric care and the maternal outcome
What Is Already Known About The Topic
Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide
Due to the heterogeneity of discriminant criteria and risk factors between cesarean section and
vaginal delivery there are some limitations in predicting postpartum hemorrhage using the same
warning model for different mode of delivery
Current prediction models for postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery are linear algorithm that
divide events into possible or not possible However most obstetrics events are not as black and
white
What this paper adds
We developed the first midwifery led clinical decision support system model based on artificial neural
network ANN algorithm for prediction of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery
This study demonstrated that the multi layer perceptron MLP network had the most accurate
prediction ability followed by the back propagation BP network the logistic regression model and
the radial basis function RBF network
This study could enrich the practice of artificial intelligence in nursing informatization
Introduction
Postpartum hemorrhage PPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide
l it
accounting for of maternal deaths and of adverse pregnancy outcomes respectively
In
makes up of maternal deaths in developed countries while in developing countries
developed countries postpartum hemorrhage has fallen to the third as a direct cause of maternal death
after pregnancy hypertension and thromboembolism however it remains the leading cause of maternal
death in developing countries
In China with the opening of two child policy from more and more elderly pregnant women have
become the potential population of postpartum hemorrhage The increasing trial of labor after a previous
cesarean section TOLAC and elective repeated cesarean section ERCS caused by previous one child
policy also deteriorate the risk of obstetric hemorrhage Maternal mortality has been decreasing and
seems to reach a bottleneck since in China but the mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage is
Page
increasing compared with the maternal mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage increased by
in to and increased to in
The cesarean section rate in China rose from in to in far from the
recommended by the World Health Organization thereby promoting vaginal delivery is an important
task in Chinese obstetrics department now As a decision maker for early warning of postpartum
hemorrhage during the vaginal delivery midwives often rely on their own experience to judge and have
not yet formed a unified decision standard On the one hand prediction and decision making for
postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery is a formidable task for midwives Multiple factors have
varying influence on the occurrence of hemorrhage among vaginal delivery women nonlinear relations
between risk factors and postpartum hemorrhage make it more complicate as well On the other hand
the qualification of most Chinese midwives is college or technical secondary school education and
standardized training of midwives is low in China as well
The objective of this study is to develop a clinical decision support system CDSS to solve above
problems A clinical decision support system is invented to help physicians make appropriate decisions
for patients it uses artificial intelligence algorithm to solve semi structured or unstructured clinical
problem Clinical decision support system not only is a principle and method based on the knowledge
reasoning and logic operation to acquire and process relevant patient data from the electronic medical
records automatically but also is an auxiliary decision making system which provide decision makers
with valuable information at the right time by the human computer interaction Clinical decision
support system is considered to be the inevitable trend of the combination of medicine and artificial
intelligence Chinese government issued many policies to promote the sustainable development of
the notice of national hospital informatization construction focusing on
medical informatization
electronic medical records by the National Health Commission in pointed out that clinical
nursing decision support system should realize intelligent input intelligent generation intelligent
reminder quality control and rectification of nursing records and other functions
Data driven clinical decision support system based on a large amount of electronic medical record data
can be divided into case reasoning system and machine learning system a good machine learning
algorithms can extract personalized features from data and summarize patterns to achieve high
Current algorithms of prediction model for postpartum hemorrhage adopted by the
accuracy

Collaborative CMQCC include logistic regression
random forest and extreme
gradient boosting Most of them are linear prediction that divides events into possible or not possible
However as real life has shown most events are not as black and white Rather than other liner
algorithms artificial neural network ANN is a multi layer complex model formed by connecting neurons
perceptron through synapses weights ANN has strong nonlinear mapping ability to address high
dimensional data it can also reasonably predict and modify the relationship between input variables and
output variables ANN models possess strong feature of self adaption self organizing self learning and

tolerate faults In recent years ANN has been applied to medical research such as prediction of
disease diagnosis and prognosis prediction of nursing adverse events which has proven high superiority
Therefore this study aims to build a scientific midwifery led clinical decision support system based on
ANN algorithm for prediction of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery which will provide a practical
theoretical basis for improving the success rate of treatment and reducing the mortality of postpartum
hemorrhage
Material And Methods
Data source and data collection
In order to identify the potential variables we first conducted a literature system review and a Delphi
method with obstetricians and midwives We adopted the search strategy to find relevant literature as
follows postpartum hemorrhage OR PPH OR transfusion AND predictor OR risk factor AND vaginal
delivery OR vaginal birth in PubMed Web of Science Embase Springer Elsevier SD and Wiley We read
related papers published in English from Moreover we considered current medical evidence and
obstetricians consultations We identified potential variables regarding this however five of these
variables residence history of postpartum hemorrhage pre pregnancy weight antenatal steroids and
antepartum infection were not registered in the electronic medical records Hence we designed the data
collection form and collected another variables manually Appendix The needed data was
retrospectively collected from the medical records of vaginal delivery women who had visited the
obstetrics clinic at our hospital the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou
China from to We also tried to use the Maternal and Child Health Information Network of
Henan Province to collect large data but some essential elements were not available in the information
system so we collected complete data manually Two trained researchers first author and second
author extracted the data from the electronic medical records
Out of registered vaginal deliveries from the electronic medical records we excluded any patients
who underwent antenatal fetal demise gestations under weeks caesarean section late
postpartum hemorrhage hematological and neoplastic disorders severe liver diseases
incomplete medical records and death before childbirth According to these criteria only
of these deliveries were available and eligible for study The final dataset included the potential
predictor variables and bleeding or not outcomes of these cases Next these women were randomly
divided into a training set a validation set and a test set
Pre processing and feature selection
The outcomes event of postpartum hemorrhage was defined as blood loss at least within
hours after the fetus is vaginally delivered This outcome was selected because it was consistent with the
most recent definition from Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage

There were data values missing for some variables we used the multiple imputation to impute missing
data values for variables in model This approach has been recommended by the prediction model risk of
bias assessment tool PROBAST and applied in previous study
Numerous variables will lead to over fitting of the model and increase the clinic burden Therefore the pre
processing techniques were frequently used to reduce dimension or select feature This step can
eliminate irrelevant weakly relevant or less important features Variable screening is an important
procedure to improve the overall stability of the model We selected variables using the backward
method and the univariate logistic regression performed by IBM SPSS software version variables
were finally identified as input neurons and the standardized importance of each variable was shown on
a scale with a maximum value of to understand the contribution of each variable in the machine
learning model Fig
Establishment of artificial neural network models and
logistic regression LR model
The artificial neural networks and LR models of postpartum hemorrhage were built based on the
identified predictors from the previous step
The multi layer perceptron MLP network
The MLP neural network consists of one input layer one or more hidden layer and one output layer The
neuron is the basic component of the network Neurons include input neurons hidden layer neurons and
output neurons MLP is a multi layer feedforward neural network it has advantages of processing
nonlinear data good fault tolerance and strong self learning ability The MLP network model can pass
the data among each neuron in direction and excavate the internal deep connections between the input
data whose learning process mainly includes the forward transmission of data and the back propagation
of errors This kind of feedback learning method can reasonably change the weight and bias of each
input so that obtain the best prediction ability for the model The number of neurons in hidden layer
can be automatically calculated by SPSS software and the relative optimal number of neurons can be
get
The Back Propagation BP network
BP neural network is multi layer feedforward neural network based on gradient descent algorithm it is
trained according to the error back propagation algorithm and has been the most widely used neural
network which is composed of input layer hidden layer and output layer Activation function between
Page
layer and layer is Sigmoid type differentiable function the error is propagated back to the input layer from
back to front layer by layer the link weight is adjusted constantly in order to realize arbitrary nonlinear
mapping between input and output The internal Sigmoid function was automatically calculated
by SPSS and the relative optimal function parameters were obtained
The radial basis function RBF network
The RBF neural network consists of input layer radial basis layer and output layer the input layer is made
up of signal source nodes the radial basis layer is a nonlinear radially symmetric function that is
attenuated to the center point according to specific needs the output layer is the output result of input
layer processed by radial basis function RBF neural network is a kind of forward conduction neural
network which is applicable to solve classification problems It can approximate any continuous function
with any precision so that achieve the optimal prediction ability by adjusting the parameters of the radial
The internal radial basis function was automatically calculated by SPSS and the
basis function
relative optimal function parameters were obtained
Evaluation of the networks and development of the
CDSS
Firstly in order to identify the best performed model based on a given dataset we not only developed five
models for the MLP network RBF network and BP network respectively but also constructed the binary
logistic regression to compare the performance of the traditional statistical analysis model and the
artificial neural network model Secondly the receiver operating characteristic ROC curves of each
model in training set validation set test set were plotted by R software We used the area under the
receiver operating characteristic AUROC sensitivity specificity and accuracy to evaluate and select the
most accurate model In addition we also conducted the internal validation by fold cross Finally we
designed the CDSS based on the most accurate network by MATLAB software to reach
visualization

Identifying significant variables for predicting
postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery
Originally we identified variables that is likely to affect the postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal
delivery women Appendix Among the deliveries included just occurred

were selected for predicting the postpartum hemorrhage Table Tables demonstrated the distribution
of these factors in our total dataset for bleeding and not bleeding respectively Figure showed the
variable importance in the selected MLP model which had the best discrimination ability The top
variables ranked from most to least important were white blood cells WBC during the first labor stage

Discussion
We preliminarily constructed and validated three ANN models to predict postpartum hemorrhage in
vaginal delivery women The MLP model indicated the best predictive ability in all groups of training
validation and test Moreover compared with the traditional logistic regression model both MLP and BP
models showed better discrimination ability to predict postpartum hemorrhage In addition A user
friendly CDSS was developed according to the MLP model
In terms of clinical application midwives could prepare full in advance for example triage expectant
mothers with high risk of postpartum hemorrhage to the corresponding obstetric care level and initiate
interventions Prediction of our model mainly focused on the time of labor and birth therefore we
adopted the variables available during the same instances It is also appropriate to construct prediction
model employing high risk factors after delivery such as cervical lacerations and newborn weight
Importantly in order to facilitate clinical use immediately we recommend the information departments in
hospital to integrate the aid decision making system in electronic medical records in the form of a risk
calculator or outputting the result automatically When a pregnant woman is laboring by an obstetrician
the midwife or other assistant could input the numerical values of the predictors into the built CDSS
Fig and the prediction outcome postpartum hemorrhage or non postpartum hemorrhage would be
output by clicking the button of submit in the designed interface of the system Once the system
identifies some pregnancy women as postpartum hemorrhage the one should be considered carefully by
the obstetricians According to the predicted outcome the obstetricians can make optimal decision for
the pregnancy women about personalized treatment in the next step In this way the obstetrician can
manage the labor stage more skillfully by early identification early warning early treatment in order to
mitigate adverse outcome for these high risk patients For example midwives can make pre transfusion
preparations for high risk patients in advance cross match blood tests and inform the blood transfusion
department to prepare blood products particularly fresh frozen plasma can take up an hour to thaw At
the same time it is conducive to the rational allocation of medical resources by arranging high risk
bleeding women for delivering in different time to avoid insufficient staff resources
In recent years medical institutions and obstetric experts at home and abroad have made a lot of
exploration in the early warning evaluation and prediction of postpartum hemorrhage The risk score
calculators formulated by them for different subgroups of people could indicate the possibility of
postpartum hemorrhage to some extent and achieved certain results Ana developed and validated a
predictive model based on the binary logistic regression and the ridge regression to measure the risk of
excessive blood loss in vaginal delivery women but this analysis only collected thirteen variables
and the sensitivity was low Michelle trained and tested a logistic regression prediction models
involving variables for hemorrhage and transfusion by a data set from deliveries however the
results were not visualized Kartic et al used two traditional statistical models logistic regression with
and without lasso regularization and two machine learning models random forest and extreme gradient
boosting to predict postpartum hemorrhage the extreme gradient boosting model showed the best in
both the discrimination and decision curve analysis but some variables in the model were difficult to
Page
collect so that limited the clinical practicability Ahmadzia et al developed an online calculator for
postpartum hemorrhage risk scores Dunkerton et al established a decision tree model for postpartum
hemorrhage prediction based on a non parametric recursion algorithm Bingnan Chen
created a
nomogram model to predict postpartum hemorrhage individually however all of them were only used for
cesarean section population Due to the heterogeneity of discriminant criteria and risk factors between
cesarean section and vaginal delivery there are some limitations in predicting postpartum hemorrhage
using the same warning model for different mode of delivery In addition most of current prediction
models for postpartum hemorrhage were linear algorithms logistic regression is a traditional statistics
algorithm which can screen out the limited variables associated with postpartum hemorrhage and
eliminate confounding variables However when there are too many variables to observe the LR
neither detect complicated nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables nor has
the ability to address collinearity between variables so some potential valid variables were removed
Compare with above models our study indicated that both neural network and logistic regression can
provide excellent discrimination for the prediction of postpartum hemorrhage hence a finally selected
model to build a CDSS should rely on a combination of model performance discrimination calibration
and net benefit clinical applicability and acceptability by obstetricians and expectant women
The ANN prediction model established in this paper aims to provide personalized prediction results and
achieve effective risk stratification The results of our study revealed that the ANN model was more
accurate to predict postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal delivery At present the ANN model has been
widely used in disease prediction and diagnosis chronic disease management medical image
recognition and other aspects it had shown superior performance than conventional predictive
models even employing the same input variables Postpartum hemorrhage as an obstetric
emergency has various factors and complex mechanism If we take the epidemiological data and use the
traditional linear discriminant function to predict it there are great limitations As an information
processing system abstracted from biological neural network ANN has the ability of self learning and
identifying the relationship between variables which can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions with
arbitrary accuracy Previous studies implied that neural network models reflected a stronger fit to
address complex nonlinear relationships and cost less effort to generate than the traditional regression
algorithms It is imperative that ANN techniques automatically conduct variables selection missing
values imputing and other data preprocessing procedures
There was a lot of literature support for the included variables as risk factors for PPH Almost all the
variables in our model are clinically available and have been identified in previous models including
newborn weight cervical laceration history of uterine surgery parity manual removal of placenta
episiotomy However one important predictor that has not been considered yet is the WBC count
during the first stage of labor it is identified of importance in this study which extended the
previous work in predicting PPH and may provide insights of underlying pathophysiology links between
inflammation participation and PPH onset In our results the WBC count of hemorrhage women were
higher than that of non hemorrhage women during the first stage of labor Possible reasons for this may
Page
be as follows infection leads to weak state of pregnancy women and those were vulnerable to PPH and
labor is a state of stress which also leads high WBC count Further more clinical laboratory studies
are needed to uncover the underlying pathophysiology mechanism between high WBC count during the
first stage of labor and postpartum hemorrhage Our outcomes for the WBC showed a standardized
importance this point maybe because the sample size was large but the morbidity of PPH was low and
the number of cases was small in this model Nevertheless another statistical algorithm was conducted
binary logistic regression to explore the odds ratio OR of the variables and confirm their statistical
significance
The second important risk factor was the newborn weight of standardized importance in our study
which again matched previous studies This may because that increased newborn weight is
associated with hyperextension of uterine muscle fibers and affects uterine contractions In addition
pregnant women with large fetal weight may have other complications such as cephalic pelvic
asymmetricity prolonged first and second stages of labor shoulder dystocia laceration of the soft birth
canal uterine contraction which also increases the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage The
newborn weight in our study was postpartum variable when the risk period of bleeding had passed we
can consider introducing a prenatal diagnosis of macrosomia or estimated fetal weight according to the
ultrasound into model Some other risk factors in our model for hemorrhage have been accepted
generally namely operative vaginal delivery induced labor manual removal of placenta episiotomy and
despite their fewer links to hemorrhage with standardized importance less than
cervical tears
the less noticeable whose effect is the more severe the situation goes
Limitations
Our study has several limitations Firstly neural network algorithms are driven by big data and rely on a
large sample size We developed a CDSS based on electronic medical record from only one center the
sample size was far insufficient the external validation was just conducted in our hospital so the result
may be not generalizable robust internal and external validation is needed before promotion and
application widely Secondly Missing data is another limitation of our study the study was restricted in
the part of valid blood loss data from the original dataset the missing value of the covariable accounted
for a considered proportion though we adopted multiple imputation techniques reported by the PROBAST
the proportion of incomplete data also limited the generalization of the model Furthermore it is more
likely that the missing values will continue to hinder integrating the models into electronic medical
records Thirdly the predictors in our study all were static hourly data such as temperature heart rate
systolic blood pressure oxygen saturation physical examination findings were not included
In addition despite embedding all risk factors in the CDSS will be promising but it may increase clinical
workload burden and could potentially delay intervention The impact of a model on aiding decision
making depends on multiple characteristics of health providers and circumstances including ability to
initiate immediately intervene response and weigh the risks against benefits capacity to take actions and
Page
Other
expectant women or obstetricians compliance with the recommended measures
environmental restrictions consist of staff space and facilities which are not considered into current
CDSS Meanwhile estimated blood loss EBL is considered to be inaccurate subjective and always
underestimated there is a mismatch between the actual blood loss and the vital signs urine volume and
mental state of the individual shown A physical compensatory period of blood loss exists in the early
bleeding stage Our definition of postpartum hemorrhage followed the current clinical guidelines
however we did not evaluate other relevant clinical indicators of acute blood loss including a deep
perineal hematoma from a laceration of the birth canal blood flow velocity and properties the bleeding
was fluid or turbulent or exudative and whether it clotted or contained clots The blood loss in
predictive models needs to be measured by means of the quantitative blood loss QBL methods such as
basic methemoglobin colorimetric method or image spectral analysis Shock Index Sl and so
on
Conclusions
In summary we developed a CDSS based on the risk factors identified by artificial neural network
algorithms This ANN model performed better than logistic regression in predicting the postpartum
hemorrhage of vaginal delivery women In the future these findings will enrich nursing informational
practice to promote the application of artificial intelligence technology such as ANN algorithm in the
field of nursing As predictive tools become more widely used in obstetric care they can be introduced
into clinical guidelines and care pathways after further testing Identification high risk mother of
postpartum hemorrhage on labor admission using the clinical decision making system will benefit
accurate prenatal diagnosis and prompt intervention which may lead to optimize obstetric care improve
maternal prognosis and rational allocation of medical resource

ABSTRACT
Objective Somalia has high rates of maternal mortality fertility and pregnancy among young women Factors
contributing to this situation are a lack of knowledge regarding sexual and reproductive health early marriages
cultural norms and the unmet need for or use of contraceptives This study aimed to explore the perceptions of
family planning among young men and women with tertiary education in Mogadishu
Methods A purposeful and convenience strategy using snowballing was used to recruit participants Four focus
group discussions were held online with young women and men aged years old All participants were
studying at five different universities in Mogadishu and only one participant was married The data were
analysed using thematic analysis
Findings The findings showed that participants objected to the concept of family planning but supported the
concept of child spacing They highlighted that people of their generation with tertiary education practise child
spacing to combine careers with family life Although all the participants knew of the benefits of child spacing
they had different opinions on whether modern contraceptive methods were an option for them They were more
comfortable with traditional contraceptive methods and believed that the quality of the modern contraceptive
medicine available in the country was unreliable
Conclusiorr Our findings suggest that it is crucial not only to include young people in family planning awareness
initiatives and implementation but also to give them a voice to advocate family planning and start dialogues
within their own communities
While efforts have been made to improve the sexual and reproduc
tive health of young people globally studies continue to report high
fertility rates among young people living in Africa
In Somalia in
Sub Saharan Africa young people aged years old constitute
approximately of the total population
and high rates of fertility
and pregnancy have been reported among young women
The
maternal mortality rate in Somalia is also one of the highest in the world

healthcare system and poor access to essential healthcare services
particularly family planning services
Investing in family planning is
crucial to achieving the sustainable development goals SDGs
It
also contributes to improving maternal health reducing maternal
mortality and morbidity and enhancing gender equality and women s
Family planning further allows both women and
empowerment
men to access accurate information regarding which contraceptive
methods can support them in their reproductive preferences
The knowledge that modern contraceptive methods are effective in
family planning and preventing unintended pregnancies has been
widely transmitted in Sub Saharan Africa yet the uptake of these con
traceptive methods remains low which is a great concern for achieving
the SDGs
In Somalia only of married women use modern
contraceptive methods and only half of the women aged years
old have heard of these methods
This indicates a low level of
knowledge about contraceptive methods among young people living in
Somalia However the knowledge of contraceptive methods among
Somali women in Somalia increases by age and education
For
instance of women without education had knowledge of con
traceptive methods compared to of women with education
Evidence confirms that education and economic are important fac
tors for women s fertility rate and use of family planning
However sociocultural norms may counteract and contribute to
women s use of family planning and preferences for larger family sizes
In many Islamic countries including Somalia birth spacing is
permitted but limiting children as family planning is interpreted is
discouraged
Several studies have shown that Somali women prefer
to have many children to enhance their status in society However
a recent study of Somali men living in Sweden showed that these men re
evaluated the ideal family size when living in a context outside Somalia
although social pressure continued to be a factor in maintaining a large
family size
While other studies of Somali men living in Sub
Saharan Africa have also shown varying opinions about family size all
the studies confirmed that knowledge about modern contraception is
low
Given this context it is important to investigate young people s
perceptions of family planning and contraceptive methods to design
gender and culture responsive interventions
More particularly
young people with tertiary education as young people with tertiary
education had knowledge and use modern contraceptive methods
Therefore in this study we aim to explore perceptions of family
planning among young men and women with tertiary education and
living in Mogadishu
Methods
Design
The study employed a qualitative exploratory design using focus
group discussions FGDs An exploratory design is useful when little
knowledge exists on the phenomenon to be explored
FGDs were
chosen because they facilitate the exploration of a phenomenon from
different points of view
allowing the authors to examine how the
phenomenon of family planning is perceived collectively by young
women and men living in Mogadishu Somalia
Setting recruiment and participants
The study was carried out in Somalia s capital city Mogadishu
which is located in the Banadir region The city is highly urbanised with
approximately million inhabitants and is administratively divided
into districts A purposeful convenience sample of young men and
women living in Mogadishu was recruited to participate in FGDs The
inclusion criteria were that the participants were young men and women
under years old who lived in Mogadishu The first author recruited
participants using the snowballing method Information about the study
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
was posted on Facebook This strategy was due to the COVID pandemic
and difficulties recruiting participants from other settings such as mos
ques coffee shops or schools It is also estimated that of Somali
youth have access to smartphones and the internet
Potential par
ticipants who showed interest contacted the first author and those who
met the eligibility criteria were invited to information meetings and to
participate in an FGD if they agreed They were then encouraged to
invite peers to participate by coming to the information meeting or
contacting the first author In total participants showed an interest in
and received information about the study and were asked for their
consent to participate At the time of the FGDs two participants could
not attend due to bad internet connectivity and one participant could
not participate due to time constraints Therefore participants were
included in four FGDs
As shown in
females and nine males aged years
Table
participated in the FGDs This study did not aim to recruit university
students exclusively however the majority of the participants
were carrying out their undergraduate studies in medicine nursing
public health or management programmes at five different universities
in Mogadishu This might be due to the information about the study
being posted on Facebook but also those who have been recruited
through snowballing were invited by their peers who were studying at
the university In addition two participants had master s degrees in
public health and management and only one of the participants was
married
Data collection
The FGDs took place between July and September Due to the
Covid pandemic they were conducted online using the Zoom plat
form Four group discussions were held comprising one mixed FGD with
both women and men two FGDs with only women and one FGD with
only men The reason for having mixed and separate sex FGDs was to
explore whether different perceptions emerged in the different FGD
types Initially we aimed to have six FGDs however in our last two
FGDs we realised that no newer information had resulted from the
discussions and therefore decided to stop recruiting more participants
after the fourth FGD
The FGDs lasted h and were audio recorded with the partici
pants consent They were conducted in the Somali language by two
Somali speaking researchers one moderating the discussions and the
other observing the interactions between the participants and their
levels of engagement Both the moderator and observer also reflected on
the discussions Their notes during the FGDs and subsequent reflections
were used when analysing the data FGDs and were moderated by a
woman last author and observed by a man first author and FGDs
and were moderated by two men first author and third author The
moderators who conducted the FGDs are experienced in conducting
such discussions and qualitative studies See

planning Before use in the FGDs the vignette was presented to students
in a master s of public health programme in Somalia who provided
feedback on whether it would be culturally accepted by the participants
The vignette was then tested in the first FGD mixed sex As no revision
was made to the vignette or the follow up questions the data from the
first FGD were included in the analysis The FGDs started with the
moderator reading the vignette aloud see
and asking the
Table
participants to give their perceptions and thoughts about the scenario
specifically in relation to family planning The aim of using the vignette
was to give the discussion more depth and focus than it would if based
on the participants perceptions alone Structured follow up questions
were asked to draw out the participants own perceptions regarding
family planning and what they would have done differently from the
couples in the vignette see
Table
The interactions during the FGDs were highly positive and the
participants appeared excited to discuss the case scenario In all the
FGDs except one the participants discussed the topic so exten
sively that there was insufficient time to cover all aspects While the
participants did not always agree they seemed to respect each other s
ideas The topics on which the participants disagreed are discussed in
the results section
Data analysis
All audio recorded FGDs were transcribed verbatim in Somali and
analysed using inductive thematic analysis
First the transcripts
were read inductively several times by the first second and last authors
The data were then read critically to capture the ideas and concepts
expressed by the participants The first and last authors who coded the
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
data ANONYMISED discussed their reflections and the ideas and
concepts that had emerged with the second author ANONYMISED
Codes were then extracted from the text segments describing the par
ticipants perceptions of the phenomenon and translated into English
ANONYMISED then grouped the codes and text segments into pre
liminary themes which were discussed by all the authors Next the
themes were revised and some of the subthemes were merged into
themes All the themes reflected on the core concept of the participants
perceptions of family planning and child spacing
Ethical considerations
The study received ethical approval from the Ministry of Health and
Human Services at the Somali Federal Republic MOH HS DGO
June All the participants received oral information about
the nature of the study and were informed that their participation was
voluntary and that they could withdraw their consent at any time
without explanation All participants gave oral consent to participate
and to be audio recorded
Results
The thematic analysis resulted in the following four themes see
Table
The first the concept of child spacing is more accepted than family
planning reflects how participants wanted to define the family planning
concept and the differences in young people and their parents and
grandparents generations attitudes towards the topic The second the
decision of child spacing goes beyond the couple describes how child
spacing decisions are shared The third acceptability and availability of
child spacing methods explores the perceptions of the participants and
society regarding what methods to use for child spacing and the quality
of the products available in the country The fourth awareness of child
spacing methods describes the participants views on the importance of
increasing awareness in society and knowledge among healthcare pro
fessionals who advise and treat women All four themes were salient in
all the FGDs
The concept of child spacing is more accepted than family planning
Many of the participants reacted to the concept of family planning
during the FGDs They emphasised that in Somalia the concept of child
spacing is used and understood to be in keeping with Islamic beliefs All
the participants objected to the concept of family planning which is
understood to limit the number of children one can choose to have as
the quotes below demonstrate
I support their idea from the vignette of spacing their children But
limiting children is not what I support because only Allah knows how many
children they will have It is not something or a decision that comes from
them FGD with women RI
I don t agree with saying that I will have a certain number of children
because we are Muslims But I support spacing the children by at least three

Scenario
This is the story of newly married couple
Farah and Halima who are in their early
twenties A year ago they met at university
when senior medical students and nursing
students were undertaking their
community awareness training in refugee
camps outside Mogadishu They fell in love
and later married Halima wanted to
discuss with Farah whether they should
wait to have children because she wanted
to finish her degree in nursing Farah said
that he had a good job now as a doctor and
Halima didn t have to work because he
could support his family
After a long discussion Farah and Halima
agreed that they would have a child now
but then wait for three years before having
their second child so that Halima could go
back to her studies and gain some work
experience

years because it is an advantage for the child FGD with both women and
men
Both religion and culture were reported to influence the participants
perceptions of family planning The participants reasons for not
accepting family planning were related to their Islamic beliefs and how
society viewed family planning The participants agreed that child
spacing was permitted in Islam but that many people in their social
environment had misconceptions regarding child spacing According to
the participants some people still believed that child spacing was not
permitted in Islam
This issue of spacing children is not something new Allah already
mentioned it in the Koran But many people do not have enough knowledge of
the Koran FGD with men
Acceptance of child spacing is related to age and educational
level
The participants agreed that individuals acceptance of child spacing
was related to their age and educational level They perceived that
young people of their generation and their parents grandparents held
different views on the topic with the young people and more educated
recognising the benefits of child spacing for both the mother and the
child to a greater extent than their parents grandparent s generation
The participants considered that social norms encourage couples to have
more children and their parents grandparent s generation follows these
norms rather than listening to facts regarding the benefits of spacing
children They also expressed that society attributes greater value and
respect to couples with more children which in turn gives the couples
increased status in the family and society
Somali society prefers and gives status to families who have many chil
dren FGD with men
Young people in our age group between and years old decide to
space their children but in the older generation the ones who have only a few
children still have seven kids FGD with both women and men
Decision of child spacing goes beyond the couple
The participants perceived that the decision to space children is
complex as it may involve other family members Even if the decision
about child spacing is made mainly within the couple both partners
families engage in the decision whether invited to or not The families
particularly the mothers frequently try to persuade the couple not to
space their children
Your own parents will not even allow you to space children for two years
Also your husband s parents won t allow you either So there are many
challenges from your families They might say Are you crazy even if you
both the couple agree they the family interfere with your decisions FGD
with women
Although many participants emphasised that the couple should
decide for themselves they knew that this view differed from the social
norm Women in particular reported experiencing social pressure to
have numerous children and potentially facing consequences for spacing
children The participants stated that society stigmatises women who
cannot give birth or who have few children In such cases the woman s
husband s family might persuade him to marry another woman even if
he is happy with his wife The only time the family might accept the
decision to space children is when the mother undergoes a caesarean
section and a medical doctor advises against trying to have another child
too soon The family will respect the doctor s advice when it concerns
the mother s health
Society and parents accept child spacing when the health of the mother
is at risk such as a caesarean section and risk to her life FGD with both
women and men
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
Acceptability and availability of child spacing methods
Using contraceptives to combine career life and family life
The participants emphasised that the young people in their genera
tion want to combine careers with family life and therefore will often
consider using contraceptives for child spacing Although many partic
ipants preferred child spacing they did not consider it something that
couples would discuss before marriage The participants agreed that
child spacing would be beneficial for couples relationships as well as
the health of the mother and her child
The whole family benefits if child spacing is used both the mother s and
child s health The couple will get time together and they will have time for
their children FGD with women RI
Traditional methods are preferred for child spacing
Although all the participants accepted child spacing and knew of its
benefits they had different opinions on whether modern contraceptive
methods were an option for all people whether women or men Both
young men and women in the study supported traditional methods such
as breastfeeding and withdrawal which they thought could be much
safer and more socially acceptable than modern methods However in
the male FGD the participants emphasised condoms as a way of spacing
children
I support the use of condoms because it has several benefits Not only does
it protect you against getting pregnant but it also protects you from other
infectious diseases FGD with men
Some participants especially women disagreed that breastfeeding
could protect the mother from becoming pregnant again They observed
that some mothers might not exclusively breastfeed which could put
them at risk of becoming pregnant
A mother might not exclusively breastfeed and then she might get preg
nant after the days after birth She gets pregnant and the child she gave
birth to will not have good health as well as the one who is on the way Not
only that but she will also suffer a lot The mother is suffering the child she
gave birth to is suffering and the one she is carrying is also suffering all three
of them are suffering FGD with both women and men
Modern contraceptive methods are unreliable
Some participants viewed the risks of the side effects of modern
contraceptive methods as outweighing their benefits They also
perceived that the quality of modern contraceptive medicine available
in the country was unreliable which made people suspicious and fearful
of using it Some participants particularly women noted that people
who want good quality modern contraceptive medicine purchased it
outside the country
When living in Somalia it is bestfor us to use the traditional way because
modern contraceptives are not reliable We don t know their quality FGD
with women RI
People do not trust the modern contraceptives available in the country
They purchase them outside the country FGD with women
The participants had different perceptions about the availability of
modern contraceptive methods in Somalia Some knew that contracep
tives were available at maternal and child health centres or hospitals
but only for married women However one participant did not know
where to find contraceptives I don t know if one can get them from
hospitals or other places This is the first time I am hearing about modern
contraceptive methods FGD with women
Awareness of child spacing methods
The participants highlighted that increasing awareness in society and
among healthcare providers is important They expressed that society
needed to understand the benefits of child spacing for the family the
mother the child and the father They indicated that raising social
G Dahir et al
awareness contributes to their desire for child spacing
Before we talk about the availability of modern contraceptive methods we
need to talk about the understanding of child spacing in society This is where
we need to start FGD with men
You know that Somali people have a bad perception regarding child
spacing or family planning Making them understand its benefits will take
time FGD with men
Another participant emphasised that awareness about child spacing
is growing but it might take time for society to accept it
We have almost accepted child spacing Let s wait on family planning and
limiting children FGD with both women and men
Participants underscored that healthcare professionals have a re
sponsibility to raise this awareness However some participants who
had conducted internships at maternal and child health facilities felt that
healthcare providers did not have enough knowledge to provide
adequate information to mothers and society They highlighted the
importance of training healthcare providers in the benefits and conse
quences of family planning
To raise awareness we need experts who can do the job in a good and
sensitive way I would say that we don t have those yet The healthcare
professionals are not yet equipped with such knowledge FGD with
women
Discussion
This study revealed perceptions of family planning and contraceptive
use among young men and women living in Somalia This is the first
study on family planning with most unmarried young men and women
living in post conflict Somalia The most compelling finding in line with
other studies
is how participants related to the concept of
family planning Consistently throughout all the FGDs the participants
objected to the concept of family planning if it was to limit the number of
children However they all supported the concept of child spacing
Another interesting finding is the shift or transition regarding family size
in the Somali community particularly in relation to how young women
and men in this study discussed the topic They thought that their
generation with tertiary education was already practising child spacing
A recent study
that investigated trends in fertility in several
countries in Sub Saharan Africa confirmed that educational level is one
factor that decreases fertility rates and increases the use of family
planning A recent study
conducted in Ghana with university stu
dents reported that the majority of their participants had knowledge of
and practised family planning However in contrast with the Ghana
study our participants suggested both withdrawal as a method to avoid
pregnancy and child spacing
Even though the participants in our study accepted child spacing
they pointed to the challenges of Somali families interfering with cou
ples decisions to practice it These findings align with those of other
studies
that highlight the role of cultural norms in fertility
preference and family planning Sociocultural norms influence how so
ciety views family size preferences
if the couple s status in
society is measured by family size this may affect how the young men
and women perceive family planning The participants in our study
expressed desperation about how to shift perceptions in families and the
community as the decision to space children extends beyond the married
couple We hypothesise that healthcare providers in Somalia play a
crucial role in promoting awareness of sexual reproductive health in the
community particularly among young people At the same time as our
participants highlighted healthcare providers need further knowledge
to be able to take responsibility for raising awareness in the community
and among women Nevertheless to increase awareness and use of
family planning methods the concept of spacing should be used
instead of family planning
The participants in our study also highlighted the importance that
young men and women living in Somalia place on combining careers
with family life and their awareness of how child spacing could support
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
this However they further underscored the unreliability and lack of
good quality contraception available in the country Accepting child
spacing does not necessarily translate to using it unless the modern
contraceptive is available
While health awareness about family
planning can be raised if contraceptive methods remain unavailable it
will be hard to decrease the fertility rate and achieve the SDGs in So
malia
Our findings also confirm the different layers needed to
achieve all the SDGs and that the importance of women s education
offering effective family planning interventions and the availability of
modern contraceptive methods are crucial
Strengths and limitations
This study has methodological strengths and limitations that need to
be addressed The credibility of the studies was ensured by conducting
FGDs with both women and men along with only women and only men
This arrangement allowed us to explore whether there were any
different views between the sexes concerning family planning While
mixed sex discussions are challenging to carry out in certain studies due
to gender sensitivity it is still important to examine different opinions
We also observed different perceptions from men who participated in
the mixed FGDs than from those who participated in the male only FGD
Male participants in the mixed FGD tended to agree with the female
participants in the group In contrast in the male only FGD FGD the
participants had other perceptions regarding family planning In FGDs
and both the moderator and note taker were male which may have
resulted in the female participants discussing less openly and largely
avoiding expressing their perceptions However they discussed and
reflected on the case scenario Conducting individual interviews might
have given us in depth knowledge of each participant s attitudes to
wards the phenomenon
Credibility was also assured by conducting the FGDs in the partici
pants native language which ensured that nuances and various
meanings of the language were captured without losing anything in
translation To ensure credibility and confirmability all the co authors
also conversed throughout the data collection analysis and interpreta
tion phases
Braun and Clarke
highlight the importance of researchers
reporting their reflexivity as researchers use their expertise to analyse
and construct the themes The research team consisted of two senior
researchers and two junior researchers all of whom work in the field of
health science While the research team had an insider perspective all
being scholars of Somali origin they also had outsider perspectives as
some of the team members are in the Somali diaspora For instance
using the term family planning in the vignette was a conscious choice
which led to discussion on whether the use of the concept of family
planning was acceptable or not for young men and women living in
Mogadishu The fact that the research team could navigate between
insider and outsider perspectives may contribute to increasing the val
idity and robustness of the findings
The main limitation is that all the participants had university level
tertiary education so the findings cannot be transferred to all young
people living in Somalia The participants in our study likely had some
knowledge of family planning as the majority of them study health
science which may have influenced their answers However the authors
aimed to reduce this bias by using a vignette posing one question at a
time to highlight the full context of the research topic avoiding leading
questions and verifying unclear responses by asking follow up questions
Another limitation is that in each FGD two or three participants
knew each other which may have led to participants having similar
perspectives and agreeing with the perceptions of others However the
aim of the FGDs was to capture general perceptions of family planning
by young Somalis living in Mogadishu rather than individual
perceptions
G Dahir et al
Conclusion
Our findings illustrate that young people with tertiary education in
Somalia support the concept of child spacing rather than family plan
ning However they have shifted their perceptions of having larger
families in comparison to their parents and grandparents generations
which according to the participants in our study is partly the result of
gaining tertiary education They also aim to combine career and family
life Although the participants in our study want to practice child
spacing social pressure may push them to some extent to continue in the
same family patterns as their parents and grandparents generation The
participants also highlighted the availability of good quality modern
contraceptives as challenging for the people living in post conflict So
malia If modern contraceptives are not available it becomes hard to
practice child spacing or implement any interventions related to family
planning Our findings suggest that including young people in raising
awareness about and implementing family planning is crucial as is
giving voice to young people to advocate family planning and start
dialogue within their own communities

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Inorganic arsenic iAs is a human toxicant to which populations may be exposed through consumption
of geogenically contaminated groundwater A growing body of experimental literature corroborates the
reproductive toxicity of iAs however the results of human studies are inconsistent Therefore we con
ducted a comprehensive review of epidemiologic studies focused on drinking water iAs exposure and
birth outcomes to assess the evidence for causality and to make recommendations for future study We
reviewed English language papers assessing birth weight gestational age and birth size Thirteen of
the studies were conducted among populations with frequent exposure to high level groundwater iAs
contamination pg L and five studies were conducted in areas without recognized contamination
Most studies comprised small samples and used cross sectional designs often with ecologic exposure
assessment strategies although several large prospective investigations and studies with individual level
measurements were also reported We conclude that the epidemiologic evidence for an increased
risk of low birth weight g is insufficient although there exists limited evidence for birth weight
decreases the evidence for increased preterm delivery is insufficient and there exists minimal
evidence for decreased birth size In further investigation of birth weight and size we recommend incor
poration of individual susceptibility measures using appropriate biomarkers with collection timed to
windows of vulnerability and speciated arsenic analysis as well as consideration of populations exposed
primarily to drinking water iAs contamination pg L Given the large potential public health impact
additional high quality epidemiologic studies are necessary to more definitively assess the risk
The extensive distribution of inorganic arsenic iAs in the
earth s crust leads to local and regional contamination of ground
drinking water supplies and widespread human exposure

is well absorbed by the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and

tion with long term exposure to concentrations pg L Naujokas

fore our aim was to comprehensively assess the epidemiologic
literature published to date and to characterize the strength of the
evidence for causal associations between drinking water iAs expo
sure and birth outcomes We also provide recommendations for
future investigations to address existing data gaps
Methods
We searched the scholarly literature using SCOPUS a com
prehensive abstract and citation database of research literature
which indexes peer reviewed journals worldwide including
Medline http www info sciverse com scopus Our initial search
was limited to original human research articles published in the
English language through August To identify candi
date papers we used the keyword combinations arsenic AND
birth outcomes papers identified arsenic AND birth
weight papers identified arsenic AND birth size
papers identified arsenic AND reproductive outcomes
papers identified and arsenic AND newborn outcomes
papers identified We manually searched reference lists in selected
papers and also employed reference lists from review papers to
identify one additional publication Paper titles and abstracts were
reviewed and retained if arsenic exposure via drinking water and
birth weight gestational age and or birth size was a study hypoth
esis On January we updated the search to include two
papers in addition to papers retained from the initial search
For each study we abstracted and summarized the location
and population sampled epidemiologic design sample size expo
sure and outcome assessment strategies covariates considered and
the magnitude and precision of effect estimates These character
istics were used in a qualitative evaluation of each study and to
assess the impact of the reported results Larger prospective stud
ies and those using individual exposure assessment strategies were
afforded greater consideration than smaller cross sectional studies
and those using ecologic exposure assessment strategies Further
more the timing and nature of individual exposure assessment
strategies were considered We expressed study results as preva
lence proportion ratios PPR odds ratios OR or average change
per unit increase of exposure B and corresponding confidence
intervals CIS or P values as reported by the authors If possi
ble we used SAS v SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA to calculate
the PPR and CIs for studies that did not report measures of
effect The overall strength and consistency of associations and evi
dence for a temporal relation in which exposure clearly proceeded
outcome were used to assess the evidence for causality and to make
recommendations for future studies Hill
Results and discussion
We evaluated peer reviewed studies that addressed drinking
water iAs and birth weight Table nine studies that captured
gestational age
and five studies that addressed birth size

conducted among populations residing in the so called arsenic

their validity and reliability have been questioned as biomarkers

icant birth weight associations were detected using a second set

and inconsistent results across exposure metrics undermines the
impact of the positive result
A much larger prospective study was conducted on
Bangladeshi women with singleton pregnancies and participating
in an ongoing maternal and infant nutrition intervention study
Rahman et al Urine specimens were collected from moth
ers at eight and weeks gestation Birth outcomes were assessed
using records stored by local health centers and augmented by

of participants with biologic measures averaging exposure across

or dietary exposures in addition to adjusting for a comprehen
Sive panel of confounding variables Effects were observed only for
women with lower iAs exposures raising the possibility of a com
peting pregnancy loss risk at higher exposures or an enhancing of
birth weight at iAs pg L by chance only
Epidemiologic studies in East Asia
China and Taiwan
Up to individuals residing in Inner Mongolia China
and residing in Taiwan are at risk for exposure to to
pg L iAs and pg L iAs respectively in contaminated
drinking water sources Nordstrom Yet we identified only
one cross sectional study of birth outcomes in an arsenic endemic
region of Inner Mongolia and one prospective cohort study of birth
outcomes conducted in an arsenic endemic region of Taiwan Two
additional cross sectional studies were conducted in China and one
in Taiwan in areas without recognized groundwater iAs contami
nation
A large cross sectional investigation conducted in Inner
Mongolia assessed singleton deliveries in women using
maternal and newborn health records stored by local clinics Myers
et al
This area is known for groundwater iAs contamina
tion and the investigators sampled water from wells suspected

which is likely to have misclassified exposure for some women
An exposure validation substudy conducted among cor
roborates the likelihood In fact the investigators were unable to
link more than half of the women to exposure data as they were
presumed to employ uncontaminated wells Women without expo
sure data were more likely to be primigravid and to have received
adequate prenatal care and so a bias may have been introduced
Again limiting the birth weight analysis to full term deliveries may
have introduced a collider stratification or over adjustment bias as
described earlier
A very large prospective study conducted in northeastern
Taiwan captured more than primiparous singleton deliver
ies
Yang et al Using registry data investigators compared
birth weights and gestational age at delivery between women
residing in areas with pg L groundwater iAs contamination

modest and not of statistical significance Though the sample size
was large the ecologic exposure assessment i e exposed vs
unexposed is expected to have introduced exposure measure
ment misclassification error into the study results Despite what
was likely to be a consequent bias toward the null hypothesis
the authors identified a small but statistically significant decrease
in birth weight suggesting that the true underlying effect may
in fact be larger than that reported Still regional comparisons
might reflect sociodemographic differences between groups and
although the authors matched by a village urbanization index and
adjusted their analysis for years of formal education residual con
founding remains a possibility
Two additional cross sectional studies were conducted in areas
of China without recognized groundwater iAs contamination In
one investigators recruited and interviewed women with sin
gleton pregnancies receiving prenatal care at one of two Shanghai
City hospitals Xu et al Total arsenic was measured in mater

Though the authors of these cross sectional studies employed
hospital delivery records and biomarkers of exposure the use of
total blood arsenic raises concern Guan et al Xu et al
Total blood arsenic incorporates both iAs as well as the compara
tively non toxic organic arsenic species Akter et al to which
humans are exposed when consuming seafood Le et al
Navas Acien et al This approach is likely to misclassify
exposure in particular for frequent seafood consumers
Marchiset
Ferlay et al and might introduce positive confounding
by reproductive toxicants also found in seafood Bushkin Bedient
and Carpenter such as persistent organohalogen pollu
tants or mercury Wigle et al driving associations away
from the null hypothesis In contrast confounding by benefi
Cial agents in seafood such as n fatty acids et al
are anticipated to negatively confound associations toward
the null hypothesis Furthermore arsenic is cleared from the
blood in a few hours and therefore is not recommended as a
biomarker for exposure particularly at low levels of exposure
ATSDR
A large prospective cohort study was conducted on
women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies and attending
an obstetrics clinic in an area of central Taiwan without groundwa
ter iAs contamination Chou et al Women were interviewed

dows of vulnerability Buck Louis et al as iAs has a half life
of approximately h ATSDR and metabolic efficiency

study results toward the null hypothesis

Japan a non arsenic endemic area Shirai et al The authors
recruited pregnant women receiving prenatal care in gestational
weeks from a single hospital and determined total arsenic in

Table

and gestational age at delivery Though prospective in nature and
with person level exposure assessment as well as adjustment for
confounding variables this small study was likely underpowered to
detect associations given the low levels of exposure Furthermore
the use of a total arsenic biomarker in a population of frequent
seafood consumers coupled to the timing of urine collection for
some participants predisposed the results to the aforementioned
biases and confounding by additional related reproductive toxi
cants
Epidemiologic studies in South America and Europe
Chile
Prior to the implementation of drinking water iAs mitigation
technologies in the approximately individuals were
exposed to pg L IAS in Chile Nordstrom although
the population currently at risk is difficult to ascertain Bundschuh
We identified one prospective cohort study conducted
et al
in an arsenic endemic region of northern Chile
Employing the public health care system in Chile pregnant
women were recruited to a prospective study during prenatal
care visits at weeks gestation Hopenhayn et al
Women had resided for a minimum of months in the city of
Antofagasta which was supplied by water sources contaminated by
gg L iAs or in the city of Valparaiso which was supplied
by comparatively uncontaminated water sources pg L
iAs The average urine total iAs concentration was approximately
fold higher among women residing in Antofagasta pg L
than in Valparaiso gg L A non significant g CI
decrease in newborn birth weight was reported per pg L
increase in maternal urine iAs Table Compared by city of resi
dence average birth weights were g CI lower
for Antofagasta neonates compared to Valparaiso neonates and
g lower when restricted to infants with
weeks completed gestation at delivery although not of statisti
cal significance The authors adjusted for maternal age BMI height
and parity cigarette smoking gestational age at delivery cigarette
smoking household income prenatal care and newborn sex The
ecologic exposure assignment strategy suggested a decreased birth
weight in association with higher maternal drinking water iAs
but the results were not statistically significant and the individual
exposure assessment approach indicated no association however
the direction of the effect estimates was consistent Collection of
biospecimens later in pregnancy was likely to have introduced
exposure measurement misclassification into the study results
with an ensuing bias toward the null hypothesis and thus might
account for the non significant birth weight decrease However
the sample size was large outcomes were abstracted from clinical
records and confounding variables were considered
Romania and Spain
Approximately people are exposed to as much as
gg L iAs in Hungary and western Romania and more than
Spaniards are likely exposed to up to pg L iAs
Nordstrom We identified one cross sectional study con
ducted in an arsenic endemic region of western Romania While
we found one study conducted on the Spanish Tenerife Island this
area is not known for groundwater iAs contamination
A recent cross sectional study described women residing
in Arad County Romania with uncomplicated full term single
ton deliveries in the previous years and having resided in the
M S Bloom et al International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
same locale for at least years Gelmann et al
Women
were recruited from four villages with known drinking ground
water iAs contamination IO pg L and four villages accessing
uncontaminated water sources pg L Data were captured by
personal interview and drinking water urine and toenail specimens
were collected Although no association was reported for drinking
water iAs and birth weight Table women with a LBW delivery
were significantly more likely to have had the sum of
urine iAs and its metabolites pg L compared to women
with a normal birth weight delivery Ratios of iAs metabo
lites in urine methylarsonate MMA and dimethylarsinate DMA
were used to identify women with higher and lower rates of iAs
metabolism Vahter and Concha Yet these were not associ
ated with birth weight nor were toenail iAs The results suggested
that mothers with a history of LBW were less likely to partition iAs
internally than mothers without LBW and that factors in addition to
metabolism may designate women to higher risk for adverse birth
outcomes in association with iAs exposure Gelmann et al
However the small sample size was unlikely to be sufficiently pow
ered to detect subtle differences in drinking water iAs in particular
at the low levels measured in this study The comparisons were
not adjusted for confounding variables although bivariate anal
ysis suggested that the groups were mostly similar in terms of
sociodemographic factors and health related behaviors Still the
cross sectional nature of this study precludes temporality coupled
to the short half life of iAs which as noted earlier introduces poten
tial exposure measurement misclassification error especially for
older deliveries
Another recent cross sectional study conducted in Tenerife
Spain described women and their newborns with mater
nal completion of a structured questionnaire and collection of
meconium from newborn diapers with total arsenic analysis
Vail
et al
Arsenic was detected in meconium specimens
ng g presumably representing cumulative exposure
starting in the week of gestation Babies n with
detectable arsenic were heavier on average than those
without P
Table although gestational ages n
were similar
Yet meconium arsenic concen
Table
tration was unrelated to reported maternal drinking water source
P As noted above for populations with low drinking water
iAs exposure and high rates of seafood consumption total arsenic
most likely reflects dietary exposure to the innocuous organic
arsenic species Furthermore the latter likely results in confound
ing by additional unmeasured agents found in seafood that may
have positively or negatively confounded the associations
Synthesis
Whereas the evidence from animal and in vitro studies provides
sufficient biologic plausibility for iAs as a reproductive toxicant
the evidence from the epidemiologic literature is inconsistent
We noted wide variation in the quality and rigor of the stud
ies reviewed particularly in terms of sample size study design
exposure assessment strategies and adjustment for confounding
Furthermore differences exist in populations studied in terms of
residence in IAS or non iAs endemic regions and thus the extent of
exposure through consumption of contaminated drinking water
Exposure to iAs decreased birth weight in some studies
Chakraborti et al Guan et al Huyck et al Xu
et al including in two large high quality prospective inves
tigations Rahman et al Yang et al A decrease was
suggested although not detected in another large and high quality
prospective study Hopenhayn et al In contrast no effect
or an increase in birth weight was reported in several other studies
Ahamed et al Chakraborti et al Chou et al
Gelmann et al Mukherjee et al Shirai et al
Vail et al
including two large cross sectional studies of high
quality
Kwok et al Myers et al Based on our review
of the literature we conclude that insufficient epidemiologic evi
dence exists to corroborate an increase in LBW as a clinical outcome
However there exists limited evidence for a continuous decrease
in birth weight across the distribution but also some evidence for
an increase with iAs
Very few studies detected associations between gestational
age and drinking water iAs with only two reports of significant
decreases reported from cross sectional investigations Ahmad
et al xu et al
In contrast two very large studies
conducted in arsenic endemic areas one cross sectional Myers
et al
and one prospective Yang et al reported no
association for drinking water iAs and gestational age in popula
tions with exposure to drinking water sources contaminated by
well over pg L iAs Based on our review of the epidemiologic
evidence published to date we conclude that insufficient evidence
exists for a causal association between drinking water iAs exposure
and gestational age However as the number of studies capturing
gestational age was limited a potential association cannot be ruled
out
Few investigations incorporated measures of birth size as
study endpoints A large well conducted prospective cohort study
reported significantly decreased head and chest circumference
with a borderline significant decrease in birth length among
infants delivered to mothers residing in an iAs endemic region
of Bangladesh Rahman et al and significant decreases
for head circumference chest circumference and birth length
were reported from a small cross sectional study conducted in a
non iAs endemic region of China Guan et al Three addi
tional studies did not report significant cross sectional associations
among populations residing in non iAs endemic regions However
the effect estimates for one study were quite strong although
imprecise Chou et al no effect estimates were reported
for another Shirai et al and exposure assessment issues
limit the interpretability of the results from the third Vall et al
Therefore we suggest there that minimal evidence exists for
a causal association between maternal drinking water iAs exposure
and reduced birth size
Recommendations
Several salient methodologic issues limit the studies we
reviewed herein and might account at least in part for the inconsis
tency ofthe reported results or likewise have biased results toward
the null hypothesis and obscured associations However investi
gations of populations exposed to high levels of drinking water
iAs were often conducted in underdeveloped regions introduc
ing practical and financial limitations into study designs Still it
seems constructive to discuss issues for consideration in future
study design to more conclusively assess risks In addition to the
methodologic limitations raised earlier variable susceptibility to
iAs toxicity dietary sources of iAs exposure and paternal effects
may also be important Consideration of these issues will require
attention to further clarify the impact of drinking water iAs expo
sure in future investigation of birth weight and birth size
Vulnerability to the toxic effects of iAs varies substantially
between pregnant women independent of gestational length Li
et al
and overlooking this issue may overshadow or oth
erwise bias associations between maternal iAs exposure and birth
outcomes Several factors including polymorphisms in the
and MTHFR genes Lindberg et al and nutritional status
for folate glutathione and methionine Vahter impact the
metabolism of iAs Adjustment for maternal BMI or height can

INTERVENTION
The study initially assessed Zika related
experiences and behaviors during
pregnancy and later expanded to
examine paternal involvement during
pregnancy and the impact of Hurri
canes Irma and Maria on access to
maternal and infant health services We
describe the study methodology which
may be leveraged to rapidly respond to
public health emergencies that affect
maternal infant health
PLACE AND TIME
The PRAMS ZPER study was imple
mented in Puerto Rico during the Zika
outbreak and after Hurri
canes Irma and Marfa The
two phase study included hospital based
surveys conducted after delivery and
telephone follow up surveys conducted
three to nine months postpartum Phase
was fielded from August to June
and phase from November
to April Phase repeated the
phase maternal surveys hospital
based and telephone follow up and
added an in hospital paternal survey and
educational component Tables and
PERSON
For both phases women who had a
live born infant in selected hospitals
and met eligibility criteria could partici
pate For phase the paternal survey
could be completed by the father of the
sampled woman s live born infant or by
the woman s partner including same
sex partners El gibility for the infants
fathers or mothers partners was
based on the mother being sampled
not on her participation in the survey
After completing the in hospital sur

Marfa posed new chal enges to pregnant
and postpartum women The PRAMS
ZPER study was in a unique position to
collect data about experiences in the
aftermath of the disaster and was lever
aged for that purpose by including
hurricane related questions The
in hosp tal data collection also allowed
PRDH to incorporate an educational
component to reinforce public health
messaging for postpartum women and
families
IMPLEMENTATION
Data from Puerto Rico s Demographic
Registry were used to identify hospitals
Sampling hospitals were selected
based on the number of births during
the previous year Hospitals with or
more births in were eligible for
participation during phase and hos
pitals with or more births in
were eligible for participation during
phase PRDH contacted selected
hospitals to complete the study s
participation agreement In phase
all eligible hospitals participated
representing of live births on
the island during the sampling period
In phase of eligible hospitals
participated representing of
births For this phase one hospital
declined participation and three hospi
tals were not included because their
maternity wards were closed after Hur
ricane Marfa
For phase the sampling design was
stratified by the island s eight health
regions Regional oversampling was not
performed for phase because of the
shortened data collection timeframe
after the hurricanes Table For both
phases probability sampling was used
to identify the sampling days in each
hospital All eligible women with a live
birth on sampled days were invited to
participate
For phase study personnel
approached women or hours
after vaginal or cesarean section deliv
ery respectively Approximately
women were identified to have been
discharged before they could be invited
to participate For phase women
were approached soon after delivery
because of the likelihood of early dis
charge e g hours after the hurri
cane For phase we were unable to
assess the number of women who
were discharged before being con
tacted by study personnel In hospital
surveys were self administered on
paper or electronic tablets with most
completed on tablets during

Given the increasing involvement of families in child protection processes pre birth and during infancy it is imperative that we have greater evidence of child
protection processes during this period A court file review was used to determine the characteristics and issues for families who are going through care proceedings
for their infants the outcomes of court proceedings and the safety plans required for families Of the court files analysed of the families were reported to
child protection prenatally and were reported postnatally One in five infants were removed into care directly from the maternity ward with the average age of
removal being months The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence drug and alcohol use and mental health issues The
majority of these cases resulted in final orders with a large proportion having until protection orders and having orders revoked or withdrawn
allowing the infant to be reunified to the family The complexity of issues of the cases in these care proceedings highlights the need for greater sophistication in
strategies to support these families who cross multiple service systems to enable reunification of families and prevention of removals
Introduction
Infant removals into out of home care by the child protection system
are a highly emotive and complex issue In Australia infants are the age
group with the highest rates of child maltreatment substantiation and
entry into out of home care Australian Institute for Health and Welfare
Internationally increases in infant child protection involvement
have been seen in England New Zealand and the United States
Pearson
et al
In Australia the over representation of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander hereafter respectfully called Aboriginal infants is
a cause of great community concern and the over representation of
Aboriginal children involved in child protection is a priority target for
reduction by the Australian Government in the National Agreement on
Closing the Gap Commonwealth of Australia Given the high
level of child protection involvement during the perinatal period this
requires a special focus for policy and practice to enable improved
outcomes for families and infants
Internationally there is great variability regarding the legal status of
a fetus and the statutory powers of child welfare protection systems of
pregnant mothers Some countries and jurisdictions within countries
including United States and England have powers to place birth alerts
on unborn babies or to notify pregnant mothers to child welfare services

where there are safety concerns Bureau of Justice Assistance
Ward et al
In Australia a number of states such as Western
Australia WA New South Wales and Queensland have legislation
which gives child protection systems the statutory power to receive and
investigate child protection notifications of pregnant mothers Depart
ment of Communities New South Wales Government In
WA pregnant mothers can be notified to the Department of Com
munities Child Protection and Family Support when an unborn child is
identified as at risk of abuse and or neglect Following investigation
these notifications may be substantiated and pre birth planning may
commence to address safety concerns with the family of the unborn child
which will usually involve parents their family and safety networks the
Department of Communities WA Health and in some cases the parent s
legal representatives In terms of time frames it is recommended that
these meetings are held in the and week of gestation
The aims of pre birth planning meetings include developing action plans
during pregnancy and following birth including preparation for the
infant e g securing safe accommodation evidence of behavioural
change to address concerns raised by the Department developing and
enacting a personal safety plan relating to family and domestic violence
and developing a safety network of people Department of Communities

In WA during there were unborn children receiving
child protection services and infants
Australian Institute for
Notifications that were substantiated
Health and Welfare
involved unborn children and infants with infants
admitted into out of home care Child protection case workers have the
statutory authority to decide whether there is an immediate and sub
stantial risk of harm to a child s well being and to take the child into
provisional protection and care This requires the child protection
department to apply to the court for a protection order
Following an application to the Children s Court by the Department
due to an infant being considered at substantial risk of harm the court
can decide that the child is not in need of protection or it can make one
of four potential orders a protection order supervision where the child
stays with the family but is supervised by the Department a protection
order time limited where the child is placed in the care of the
Department for up to two years a protection order until where the
child is placed in care until they are years old or a protection order
Special Guardianship Order where the child is placed with a carer
other than the Department until they are years old Department of the
Attorney General The Department submits evidence to the court
to support the protection and care application which typically includes
the requirements of parents to address safety plans
There is currently no research literature on the requirements of
families pre post birth to meet safety requirements of the Department or
the outcomes of these care proceedings The literature that is available
around infants in care proceedings is from England which found that
infants aged less than year constituted of all children in care
proceedings with the largest proportion of infants being newborn
weeks old Almost half of all newborns recorded the final legal order
outcome as placed for adoption with placed with extended
family and placed with parents on supervision orders
Broad
hurst et al In New Zealand a rise in infant removal legal orders
was reported until with a reduction in orders from to
following the Hawkes Bay case
Keddell et al
This sentinel event
in drew media and community attention to the ethical and pro
cedural issues of the use of interim orders a without notice removal
order involving babies This resulted in several enquiries
including a review of the use of interim orders which subsequently
led to a reduction in removals
Given the increasing involvement of families in child protection
processes pre birth and during infancy it is imperative that we have a
greater understanding of child protection and court outcomes for fam
ilies subjected to care proceedings as well as the requirements placed on
families for orders to be revoked and potential reunification Therefore
this study aims to determine the characteristics and issues for families
who are going through care proceedings for their infants the outcomes
of court proceedings and the safety plans required for families by using a
court file review
Method
This study is a court file review conducted in of cases
from a random sample of WA Children s Court case files for families
experiencing a child protection removal of their child into out of home
care within the child s first year of life The study sample criteria
included cases where an infant had court proceedings and was placed
into out of home care within days from birth in WA Court files from
the year was chosen from which to select cases so that we could
follow up proceedings to the latest finalised court proceeding as of
In WA there were infants aged year admitted to care
and protection orders in with approximately half the cases
being Aboriginal Australian Insitute of Health and Welfare The
final sample for which data was extracted were infant cases which is
of cases Mixed methods analysis was used to conduct a quanti
tative analysis of the court file data and a qualitative analysis of safety
plan requirements within the court files
Children and Youth Services Review
Variables and pro formafor data collection
Data was accessed and extracted from the case files using a proforma
designed for the study and entered into SPSS The pro forma was
developed from similar studies and policy documents then revised
through consultation with Court staff and pilot data collection from the
Court files Variables were chosen to describe the characteristics of the
cases services utilised and factors associated with child protection
involvement Information on both parents and infants were extracted
and relevant information regarding placements and court outcomes
Parent characteristics
Demographics Characteristics of both parents including de
mographic factors such as age and ethnicity Aboriginality or non
Australian
Parents Own Abuse History Parents own child protection history was
collected where possible
Mental Health The recorded mental health status of parents was
collected from the proceedings and or supporting information filed by
parents or child protection services Parents mental health status was
collected as an indicator of mental health issues whether it was an
official diagnosis self reported by the parents or documented by
caseworkers
Criminal involvement Parents current and historical criminal
involvement was included where it was noted on the file that they were
incarcerated and or on parole during child protection proceedings
Pre and post natal notifications to child protection services Information
on the prenatal and postnatal notifications to child protection services
and the areas of safety concerns were recorded based on available
information
Services Services parents were referred to or involved with to
ascertain support parents were provided in relation to child protection
concerns
Infant characteristics
Demographics The infant s age at removal their sex Indigenous
status and number of siblings The infant s age at removal was ascer
tained by calculating the difference between the infant s date of birth
and the date they were assumed into care or removed
Safety plans
In WA safety plans are developed with families where there are
substantiated child protection concerns The court files contained in
formation on the safety plan requirements for families
Data analysis
The quantitative data was analysed using SPSS with descriptive
statistics reported The qualitative information on safety plan re
quirements was recorded in the proforma and entered into NVIVO The
safety plan requirements were coded and thematically analysed using
NVIVO Braun and Clarke Two researchers coded the data to
identify areas of concern and requirements for parents in the safety plan
Inter rater reliability was determined by cross checking identified codes
and themes across the safety plan requirements for the cases
Ethics
Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Western
Australia Human Research Ethics Committee RA
Approvals to access court files and extract information on site were
provided to researchers by the President of the WA Children s Court and
the Justice Research Application and Advisory Committee
M O Donnell et al
Results
Of the court files analysed there were more male than female
infants with similar proportions of Aboriginal and non Aboriginal in
fants see
Tablel
Infants were removed into care from less than a week
to up to months but on average at months The majority of in
fants had siblings with a large proportion having an elder sibling
in care On average families had children removed
Of the cases of the families were reported to child protec
tion prenatally and reported postnatally
There was vari
Fig
ation in the outcomes of the final orders with having an until
protection order reunified with family and placed on a
special guardianship order
Of those cases with a prenatal report were placed on protection
orders until on protection orders years on special
guardianship orders the order was revoked and infant was
placed on a supervision order with a parent
The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence
drug and alcohol use and mental health issues
Half of the infants were placed in foster care and the other half
Table
in kinship care placements The Department had legal representation in
of cases with of mothers having legal representation in final
orders and fathers a lesser extent at Only a small proportion of
cases had a parental affidavit on file
Safety Reunification planning
For mothers who are pregnant or parents who have an infant where
there are concerns about safety and wellbeing the Department will meet
with parents to develop a safety plan According to the Department of
Communities Departments Child Protection Practice Manual safety
planning is a proactive structured and monitored process that provides
parents with an opportunity to demonstrate that they can address the
Departments concerns by providing safety for their child Department
of Communities It is a process which takes place between a child
protection case worker parents may contain people within the safety
network and if appropriate the child The process usually involves a
written plan to address the Department s concerns of harm or potential
harm during pregnancy or for a child through the development of safety
goals
In the court case files the majority of the cases had safety plans on
court files The requirements for parents were coded into the
matic areas Requirements were fairly consistent across the files
regarding concerns that were required to be addressed which are out
lined below Table
Actively engage with Departrnent
A large proportion of cases had a requirement that parents
would actively engage with the Department and was stipulated explic
itly in parents safety plans
Engaging with Department Task respond to all calls home visits
letters and text messages and attend all meetings Inform case
manager ASAP if contact details change or there are difficulties
attending a scheduled appointment Goal To be actively engaged
with the Department attend all meetings attend all arranged con
tacts with infant to work towards reunification Case
Continue to engage appropriately with the Department For
example be respectful attend meetings advise if they cannot attend
meetings and contact Continue positive contact If contact does not
occur at no fault of the parents there will be a make up contact
Case
To ensure engagement with the Department there were a small
number of safety plans that stipulated specifically mobile phones Two
plans required the parents to

Case
Financial stability
A number of parents were required to demonstrate the ability
to manage finances in order to provide for their children and to meet
their children s needs In some cases parents were required to undergo
financial counselling and or voluntary income management particularly
if they were not able to successfully demonstrate an ability to budget
There were also examples in which parents were instructed not to seek
financial assistance from family or the Department Examples include
Mother to demonstrate ability to manage finances appropriately
and responsibly that will enable her to provide for the children
Case
Mother must undergo financial counselling progress and plan to
pay off debts and manage living costs Case

Accommodation
There were a large proportion of parents in which safety plans
stipulated a requirement to obtain and maintain stable safe hygienic
accommodation Wording typical of this requirement was
to obtain and maintain stable safe hygienic accommodation for
children Case
Some parents in their safety plan requested assistance from the
Department for accommodation which included parents who were being
released from prison and mothers who were trying to obtain housing
accommodation due to domestic violence
Father has requested assistance with accommodation following
release from prison Case
Mother told Department CPFS she would take a copy of her

Relationship counselling
There were a number of parents that were required to attend
couples counselling to address relationship conflict The requirement
was worded fairly consistently across these parent s safety plans

n
A large group of parents had safety plans that had re
quirements around domestic violence Some parents were required to
end a relationship with an abusive partner and not to enter in any further
relationships with abusive partners The onus in these safety plans
appeared to be on mothers who experienced domestic violence to ensure
they do not have a relationship with an abusive partner or potential
partner There were also stipulations to notify police if violence occurs
or a Violence Restraining Order VRO was broken Examples of these
requirements include
No physical contact with a male mentioned Case no further
incidents of domestic violence including with any new partners or
other people Case To increase frequency or duration of con
tact with children parents must cease being involved in a domestic
violence relationship Case and Mother will need to demon
strate she has the capacity to protect children from being exposed to
violence Case
and
Mother to report to police if physically assaulted or attacked and for
her not to engage in any violence or assaults Case and report
all breaches by father of VRO or other orders to the police Case
Some safety plans required children to go to someone in their safety
support network or for fathers to walk away to avoid domestic violence
incidents
Children and Youth Services Review
Parents agree to stop arguing and for father to walk away from
mother to avoid further incidents Case
If parents argue children will go to grandparents Aunty s house or
father will go for a walk to cool off Case
Mother and father will continue to protect children from violent
environments If they argue father will leave the caravan to allow
the situation to cool down Bottom line If there continues to be
violence in front of the children the Department may recommend
that father leaves the family home until this issue is addressed
Case
Parents were often required to complete FDV or anger management
programs or counselling with more specific goals of demonstrated un
derstanding of domestic violence and safety planning Typical safety
requirement for mothers were
For mother to be ready for reunification she needs to Complete an
anger management program and demonstrate ability to manage
conflict problem solve understand cycle of violence power and
control and impact of DV on children No further DV reports or vi
Olent behaviours If father perpetrates violent behaviour mother is to
take protective steps as per safety plan Case
Domestic Violence Task attend DV counselling programs Goal
obtain a positive report from counsellors regarding mother s
participation and understanding of the effect of DV on children
Mother will need to demonstrate she has the capacity to protect
children from being exposed to violence Case
Parents will ensure that the children are not exposed to FDV and
will sort out their problems in a non violent way so that children will
become healthy happy adults that will learn to resolve conflict in a
nonviolent manner Mother no reports of violence from the police
or community with father or any other family or community mem
bers DV counselling to address issues related to DV including being
a victim of DV and her understanding of the impact of DV on chil
dren living in environment which it occurs Case
Mother to provide environment free from verbal and physical
violence by attending and participating in therapeutic intervention
re DV meeting with Dept workers to discuss and demonstrate un
derstanding of DV develop detailed personal safety plan for herself
and child report all breaches by father of VRO or other orders to the
police Dept will refer mother to DV program and fund any associated
costs Dept will also consider referral to Safe at Home service if
mother secures her own accommodation Case
Similarly for fathers particularly where fathers were perpetrators of
violence there were cases of specific requirements regarding courses and
programs as well as demonstrated understanding and behaviours
For father to be ready for reunification he needs to Participate in an
anger management and DV program and demonstrate he has
addressed his issues with DV anger management and impulse con
trol for a period of time determined by the Dept Case
Father no reports of violence from the police or community with
mother or any other family or community members Behaviour
Change program to address his role in DV including being a
perpetrator of DV a victim of DV and his understanding of the
impact of DV on children living in the environment in which it oc
curs Case
Father to provide environment free from verbal and physical
violence Father to demonstrate alternate strategies apart from use of
violence and that he understands impact of violence on safety and
wellbeing of child by participating in men s behaviour change
program following release from prison and allowing Dept to seek info
regarding participation and engagement from program provider
demonstrate ability to follow and abide by orders and instructions
issued by CPFS Corrective Services and Police Case
M O Donnell et al
Drug and alcohol
A large number of parents had requirements in relation to
drugs and alcohol in their safety plans
Some cases stipulated that Children will be in a home where there is
always a sober adult to look out for their safety and ensure that all their
basic needs are met Case Other cases the Department stated that
Parents wont drink alcohol when caring for children If father wants to
drink more than drinks he will go to his father s house and return when
sober If mother wants to drink she will do the same at her family s
house Case
A large proportion specifically had requirements around
urinalysis and drug testing with variable requirements ranging from
random urinalysis testing to weekly testing Examples included
Random urinanalysis Mother required to attend same day as
request Father Should he wish to have supervised visit he would
need to undergo drug screening Case
Task complete random urinalysis weekly Goal To abstain from
illicit drug use and providing clean urine samples A missed test will
be recorded as a contaminated sample Period minimum of
months Case
Parents to engage in urinalysis testing up to times per week and
remain clean for months Case
Drug and alcohol free for months required urine analysis and
random hair analysis Case
Parents were also commonly required to complete residential reha
bilitation or drug and alcohol outreach programs The requirements
were fairly consistent across the cases although there was some variation
on the detail of the requirement outlined For instance the first example
below relied on professional advice on whether the parent had met re
quirements and made sufficient progress however the third example
also required a drug relapse prevention plan
Mother to remain drug free by completing residential rehabilitation
or outreach program Goal abstain from illicit drug use Period for
length of program or on professional advisement that all re
quirements completed and sufficient progress made Case
Attend drug rehabilitation facility or engage in outreach drug and
alcohol counselling Department can provide service information but
parents to initiate contact and ensure attendance Parents to under
stand reasons for drug use develop alternative coping strategies and
understand impact of drug use on parenting ability capacity Case
Mother to demonstrate that she can apply what she has learned
about DV drug use and anger management over a period of no less
than months To abstain from speed methamphetamines and
amphetamines reduce marijuana use and undertake urinalysis
when requested Mo to also have a clear drug relapse prevention plan
outlining what she will do when she feels like using who she will get
help from and what they will do Case
There was also variation in the amount of support offered by the
Department across cases in relation to drug and alcohol requirements
Some cases the Department offered to provide the referral to drug and
alcohol services whereas others were required to contact the services
and or admit themselves
Task attend and complete residential rehab program Mother ex
pected to contact centre and admit herself Case
There was also variation in the level of financial support for parents
to be able to attend counselling with some getting some financial
assistance and other parents required to be financially responsible for
counselling Some examples include
Children and Youth Services Review
Counselling engage in counselling sessions sessions with a
psychologist covered by Medicare and Dept will cover cost of gap
Case
Mother to enter a detox and rehabilitation program and complete
weeks of program to graduate Mother to attend and be financially
responsible for regular counselling regarding her drug dependency
Case
Mental health
Over half the cases had mental health related requirements
The most prevalent of these was that parents were required to get a
mental health assessment and counselling Common examples of this
requirement included
Mental health assessment counselling Task Undertake psycho
logical assessment to determine if there are mental health issues that
may impact on parenting capacity and anger management and
attend counselling service Goal address any mental health and
anger management concerns e g obtain a mental health plan from a
GP for referral to psychologist a number of sessions will be covered
by Medicare Parent expected to contact services and book own
appointments Period number of sessions determined by counsel
lors Case
Counselling engage in counselling sessions sessions with a
psychologist covered by Medicare and Dept will cover cost of gap
Dept would like mother to address issues of past trauma identify
triggers which can cause stress and poor mental health learn
appropriate coping strategies and how to avoid negative coping
strategies e g alcohol use Dept will require a progress report from
counsellor Case
There were a small number in addition to a mental health
assessment where there were requirements to have an assessment for
intellectual capacity and how it may impact on the ability to adequately
parent
Department needs to see that mother s mental health and intellec
tual capacity are sufficient to provide for the safe parenting of infant
Counselling and mental health Mother will attend appointments
arranged for her mental health and cognitive functioning to be
assessed Mother will continue to attend counselling until the rele
vant service provider confirms that she is able to self manage her
mental health Reunification timetable to transition infant home
Dept will consider reunification of infant to care of Mother once
following occurs Receipt of a mental health and cognitive func
tioning assessment stating that Mother is capable of providing infant
with his daily needs and is willing and able to keep infant safe Case
Undertake assessment of cognitive functioning Undertake psycho
logical assessment with a Department psychologist to assess
parenting capacity including capacity to learn modify behaviours
and sustain behavioural change Follow through with recommen
dations from the psychological assessment regarding any further
supports in line with reunification goals Case
Some mother s were required to attend specialist mental health
clinics or assessments which were exemplified by the cases below
Task Continue to see psychiatrist at KEMH maternity hospital in
women s and newborn services Goal follow up all recommenda
tions Period dependent on recommendations from mental health
providers Mother to continue to engage with KEMH psychiatrist and
take medication Case
Mother to undergo a neurological assessment in relation to previous
injuries sustained from DV and reported seizures Mother to maintain
current mental health treatment plan medication and further
therapy Case
M O Donnell et al
Parenting skills and capacity
There were a large proportion of cases where mothers and
fathers were required to address parenting issues in their safety plans In
some cases this involved undertaking parenting courses which
primarily included the requirement
Parenting Task attend age appropriate parenting courses such as
Circle of Security Goal obtain positive reports from facilitators and
contact supervisors regarding participation and understanding and
meeting children s needs Period ongoing Case
A large proportion of parents were asked to complete a
parenting capacity assessment which had varied wording regarding
what was to be assessed Some examples include
Mother to participate in parenting capacity assessment by Depart
mental psychologist or other professional to provide an opinion re
attachment between mother and child mother s insight into child s
needs mother s capacity to meet child s needs any psychological
mental health personality issues that may impact mother s capacity
to parent mother s capacity to prioritise child s safety within her
lifestyle and interpersonal relationships Case
Undertake psychological assessment with a Dept psychologist to
assess parenting capacity including capacity to learn modify be
haviours and sustain behavioural change Case
Some children had specific health issues e g born pre term low
birth weight therefore parents were required to attend medical ap
pointments and engage with child health nurses health professionals to
meet their children s medical needs
Mother to take baby to all medical appointments and vaccinations
Mother to accept visits from and cooperate with the nurse from
KEMH Mother to accept visits from and attend visits with the child
health nurse Mother to engage with Best Beginnings once the
referral is activated Depending on feedback from KEMH during her
two day stay regarding mother crafting skills CPFS may require
Mother to engage with Ngala and attend the residential program
Case
Mother to demonstrate she can meet child s therapy needs by
attending appointments and completing daily at home therapy ex
ercises as required Mother to attend child s medical appointments
and meet with therapists to learn how to facilitate child s daily at
home therapy sessions Case
For the infant to be returned to parents they need to demonstrate
they will engage with CPFS and other relevant agencies such as child
health and Aboriginal health services to ensure that the children are
safe and receive adequate health care food and supervision They
need to ensure to attend all medical appointments for the infant and
ensure that they get immediate medical attention when required
Parents need to demonstrate that at all times that they can consis
tently provide care that will address all of child s medical needs such
as attending all necessary appointments physiotherapy ophthal
mology and OT as well as providing care at home that ensures that he
does not regress developmentally Case
In many safety plans there were requirements about contact visits
and some outlined specific behavioural expectations
Contact with children remains positive by focusing on children s
needs and attending contact or rearrange that they can t contact
Mother to engage in a group service that address parenting issues
participate actively and receive a favourable report that confirms this
and that she has developed positive parenting strategies Case
Contact attend regular contact remain child focused regulate
emotions and mental health during visits Case
To demonstrate ongoing commitment to child by meeting child s
needs during contact when in prison consistently attending contact
Children and Youth Services Review
following release from prison communicating with Dept regarding
plans while child in care and throughout reunification process
Case
A number of parents were also asked to complete in home parenting
support programs or reunification programs
Complete parenting program and participate in home parenting
support program Mother acts protectively towards children stays
drug free responds to children s medical educational physical and
psychological needs to a good enough level Case
Mother will work with Centrecare Djooraminda Reunification Ser
vice to learn about medical needs of children and develop a plan of
how needs will be met establishing a routine keeping house clean
discipline strategies health eating and food prep Mother will
maintain and demonstrate her learning for a period of months
before reunification can occur Mo needs to support children in going
to school every day Case
A number of safety plans outlined the progression of contact based
on meeting specific conditions and favourable reports In some cases
this included parallel planning if the parents were unable to meet these
conditions and requirements An example Case is outlined below
Progression of contact Stage Where contact has been assessed as
positive and in the best interests of the children it will progress to
ward increased supervised periods within a period of not less than
months once parent s demonstrate their ability to attend every
contact on time provide clean urinalysis participate in counselling
for drug use DV and commence a psychological and parenting
capacity assessment
Stage Once parent s successfully meet these conditions and con
tact has been assessed as positive and in the children s best interests
then unsupervised contact will be offered providing for parent s to
leave the venue where contact will be held with children
Stage On successful completion of Stage unsupervised contact
will progress toward home visits during which time a referral will be
made to a reunification programme
Stage On successful completion of stage a transition toward full
reunification will commence
Parallel planning In the event that parent s have not been able to
commence addressing the requirements for reunification within a
month period the Department will develop a parallel plan for the
children s long term care and may seek to revoke the time limited
orders and replace them with until orders so that the children can
be placed permanently
Co occurring family issues service referrals
On average families had three family issues or service referrals to
address the departments concerns Of the cases had three family
issues service referrals with of families having four The majority
of families were asked to address drug and alcohol concerns or attend
drug and alcohol services rehabilitation followed by parenting
services parenting capacity assessments mental health services
and domestic violence services
Discussion
This research provides important evidence from a court file review of
families going through care proceedings for their infants who were
removed into out of home care due to child protection concerns in the
child s first year of life Of the court files analysed of the
families were reported to child protection prenatally and were
reported postnatally Half of the cases involved infants who were
Aboriginal One in five infants were removed directly from the
maternity ward with infants removed into care on average at
M O Donnell et al
months The majority of the infants had siblings with a large
proportion having an elder sibling in care
The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence
drug and alcohol use and mental health issues The
majority of these cases resulted in final orders with a large proportion
having until protection orders and having the orders
revoked or withdrawn with the infant restored to the family For infants
that were reunified the average time to reunification was months
Half of the infants were placed in foster care half were placed in kinship
care and a large proportion of extended family were assessed for care
and found suitable although some did not have the capacity for a full
time care role
While in all cases the Department had legal representation of
mothers had legal representation at final orders and to a lesser extent
fathers The challenge in undertaking the case file reviews was
that the majority of the information contained in the file was evidence
filed on behalf of the Department with only of cases having a
parent affidavit on file This is in contrast to the case file review con
ducted in New South Wales where the majority of cases had parent af
fidavits presented to the court as evidence Taplin et al under review
The majority of cases had information from the Department
regarding safety plans which articulated the requirements of parents for
their infant to be reunified to their care To our knowledge there are no
previous studies that have examined the safety plans in case files to
determine parental requirements There was also no information on the
files of how the safety goals and requirements were decided upon or
whether they were developed in collaboration with parents or advo
cates support workers A greater understanding of this process would be
useful in research going forward In many of the files the requirements
were worded very similarly indicating that they are commonly used
requirements across the Department
There were a large proportion of cases where parents were required
to actively engage with the Department with some articulating specific
behavioural requirements including responding to calls attending
meetings and being respectful Engagement has been described as a
process of establishing effective working relationships so that there can
be a shared understanding of goals and a shared commitment
Parenting Research Centre As outlined in a scoping review of
engagement of birth parents in the child protection system many factors
can impact on parent s ability to engage including the impact on families
of multiple and complex needs previous involvement with child pro
tection including parents being a child in care history of stolen gen
eration and government mistrust cultural differences and risk or deficit
based approaches to families by workers
Parenting Research Centre
It is noted that in some cases the Department provided mobile
phones to assist parents with contact with case workers Engagement
strategies by the Department and other service providers are essential
for working with these families many of whom are faced with high
levels of adversity historical mistrust challenges accessing services and
dealing with multiple and complex needs
Many of the families had requirements in relation in financial and
housing stability There is a wealth of evidence that families facing
poverty are more likely to be involved in child protection services
Bywaters et al The challenge for these families is not only
ensuring that they can provide evidence of their ability to budget and
meet the financial needs of their family but also attend appointments to
address their mental health drug and alcohol use and domestic violence
issues that are resulting in the safety concerns by the Department In
some of the safety plans this was acknowledged by caseworkers who
specifically stated what financial assistance would be provided to enable
parents to access assessments and counselling The associated issue of
housing was also mentioned in of the safety plans with most
required to maintain stable safe and hygienic accommodation Given
the complexity of issues that these families are facing maintaining
stable accommodation is a challenging issue This was mentioned in a
number of safety plans where mothers fleeing domestic violence were
Children and Youth Services Review
utilising violence restraining orders to assist with priority housing and
emergency housing services Some safety plans however were clear that
while the Department would provide the mother with a list of housing
support services and a letter of support relating to the priority list the
onus was specifically on the mother to actively source accommodation
and in some cases address the issues that led to homelessness Given the
social housing waiting list in WA which is approximately
households with a year average wait time many of these families will
struggle to maintain stable accommodation in the short term to meet this
The additional challenge is that to
requirement
Shelter WA
address the other concerns of mental health and drug and alcohol use it
is essential to have stable housing to provide stability for recovery
Padgett
Domestic violence was another important child protection concern in
many of the safety plans There was variation in the requirements made
on families Many families were required to address this by being
referred to FDV anger management programs or for counselling with
some required to develop safety plans and to use a safety support
network Requirements in relation to perpetrator accountability was
mentioned in a number of the safety plans which put the onus on per
petrators to address their violent behaviour However there was some
concerning requirements in which the onus appeared to be on the
mother to demonstrate the ability to protect children from being
exposed to violence and to not enter into any future relationships with
an abusive partner There is also a challenge in that police reports could
be used as evidence as seen in cases and therefore if a mother contacts
police to report DV then this could potentially be used as evidence that
she is not able to protect her children from exposure to violence and
abuse In addition given that many of the families had difficulty
maintaining stable accommodation this would preclude them from
being provided some of the intensive support programs which would
support mothers facing domestic violence and the associated impacts of
trauma on mental health This issue is broader than child protection s
jurisdiction and will require ongoing government strategies to address
the social housing shortages and the complex interaction of services to
meet families with multiple and complex needs and who are experi
encing family violence Commonwealth of Australia
The complexity of issues described in the case files does indicate the
need for intensive support to assist families Families on average had
three family issues service referrals to address the concerns of the
Department with the main areas being drug and alcohol parenting
mental health and domestic violence The requirements across the
safety plans were numerous and many families were required to be
referred and seek support from multiple agencies There was no clear
indication from the safety plans who would provide case management
support for the family or assist them to meet the Department s re
quirements This is a challenge in the service provision space as the level
of intensity required to support these families with multiple and com
plex issues will be high and for services who are procured to only pro
vide DV mental health or substance use services it is a challenge to
provide families with the wrap around support they need for successful
outcomes This highlights the need for greater sophistication in strate
gies to support these families who cross multiple service systems and
have a high complexity of needs Supporting families to engage with pre
birth and post birth safety planning where their voices and articulation
of needs is vital in ensuring that these families are fully engaged and
supported throughout this process There is preliminary evidence that
pre birth independent facilitators utilised in WA pre birth meetings have
been viewed by families as important to enabling them to have a greater
voice in these meetings Trew et al Aboriginal family led deci
Sion making has been shown to be effective in Victoria and is being
trialled in WA to enable greater self determination and cultural safety
for Aboriginal families involved in developing family plans Department
of Human Services Victoria is also leading the way in their
innovative court model Marram Ngala Ganbu to address the over
representation of Aboriginal children in care with WA trialling an

alternative court model for families with cases prioritised for those
families involved in child protection processes during pregnancy and
infancy
Arabena et al
While this research has provided evidence of the care proceedings
involving infants in their first year of life where there are child protec
tion concerns it does have limitations The majority of the case files
accessed were based in the metropolitan area and unfortunately we did
not have capacity to review cases at regional courts An understanding of
these cases is important particularly given the over representation of
Aboriginal infants and the challenges of accessing services and support
in regional and remote communities What was particularly disap
pointing in the case file review was the lack of evidence in the files that
was used to support families or provide evidence to refute the claims
made by the Department Therefore the predominant views presented
to the court and in the files were in relation to the Department s child
protection concerns As the proceedings in the court are not available to
researchers this provides a gap in the evidence and would require re
searchers to seek permission from the court to be present during pro
ceedings There is also no evidence within the files to determine the
effectiveness of services assessment validity or the ability of families to
meet the caseworker requirements While these limitations should be
addressed in future research the evidence from this study on care pro
ceedings and the requirements of families to gain restoration of their
infants fills a gap in the current research
Over the last ten years we have seen an increase in the number of
pregnant mothers and families being notified to child protection services
nationally and internationally as well as a rise in the number of infants
coming into the care system All nations are committed to ensuring that
children can grow up safely with their family and therefore ongoing
international research and evidence is required to determine the effec
tiveness of processes to address safety concerns and support families to
achieve optimal outcomes There is also the need to ensure that strate
gies are sophisticated enough across government to meet the needs of
families who are facing adversity at a level of service provision appro

BACKGROUND Opioid use disorder is a leading cause of death
through the year postpartum
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify the association of neighbor
hood level social determinants of health and prenatal opioid use disorder
treatment receipt with the outcomes of medication treatment for opioid use
disorder through the year postpaitum among a cohort of birthing people
STUDY DESIGN This was a population based retrospective
study that used state Medicaid claims and enrollment data for the
individuals who delivered a live infant between July and Decem
ber and received medication for opioid use disorder at delivery
The primary exposure was the state Health Opportunity Index a composite
measure of social determinants of health linked at the census tract level
Secondary exposures included comprehensiveness of opioid use disorder
treatment and duration of medication treatment for opioid use disorder
received prenatally Outcomes included the duration and continuity of
postpartum medication treatment for opioid use disorder operationalized
as the time from delivery to the discontinuation of medication treatment
for opioid use disorder and percentage of days covered by medication
treatment for opioid use disorder within the months after delivery
respectively
RESULTS Within the study sample deliveries were to billhing
people in the lowest state Health OppMunity Index tercile indicating high
burden of negative social determinants of health in the middle state
Health Opportunity Index tercile and in the highest state Health
Opportunity Index tercile Using stepwise multivariable regression Cox
proportional hazards and negative binomial models guided by a socioeco
logical framework prenatal receipt of more comprehensive opioid use dis
order treatment and or longer duration of prenatal medication treatment
for opioid use disorder was associated with improved year postpartum
opioid use disorder treatment outcomes duration and continuity of medi
cation treatment for opioid use disorder When the state Health OppMu

rather than solely contributions by indi

have largely focused on individual level

Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to identify the association of neighborhood level social deter
minants of health and prenatal opioid use disorder treatment receipt with medi
cation treatment outcomes for opioid use disorder through the year postpartum
among a cohort of birthing people
Key findings
This retrospective cohort study linked Medicaid claims with a cen
sus tract level measure of social determinants for members receiving medi
cation for opioid use disorder at delivery N Prenatal receipt of more
comprehensive opioid use disorder treatment and or longer duration of prenatal
medication treatment for opioid use disorder was associated with improved
year postpartum outcomes of opioid use disorder medication treatment across
neighborhood levels of social determinants
What does this add to what is known
To improve outcomes of postpartum people with opioid use disorder interven
tions should prioritize the expansion of medication treatments and targeting of
neighborhood level social determinants
Opportunity Index HOI We hypoth
esized that the neighborhood level
SDoH for the birthing person as mea
sured by the HOI along with the
degree of prenatal MOUD would be
associated with improved postpartum
MOUD outcomes

Outcome measures
The primary outcomes were postpar
tum MOUD duration and continuity of
MOUD receipt MOUD was captured
by pharmacy claims ie buprenorphine
and procedure codes ie methadone
MOUD duration was operationalized as
the number of days to first MOUD dis
continuity after delivery allowing for
up to a day gap between MOUD
claim dates An allowable day gap
was intentionally selected on the basis
of clinical experience and to account for
mistiming of claims to medication pro
vision If individuals switched between
MOUD type this was not considered a
gap nor discontinuation In addition
overlapping pharmacy claims dates
were considered to allow for surplus
days supplies to accumulate ie shifting
refill date forward for early refills
MOUD continuity was operationalized
as the cumulative number of days cov
ered by MOUD divided by the cumula
tive number of days enrolled in full
benefit Medicaid within the months
after delivery

Introduction
Adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight LBW and preterm

Hg and lead Pb are well known environmental heavy metal loid s
that top the list of priority hazardous substances in the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR
ATSDR
They are recognized as toxic during critical windows of
fetal and infant development and may cause intrauterine growth re
striction and fetal loss
A number of studies of populations in areas with very high en
vironmental levels of As and Cd such as Bangladesh India Japan
China and Chile have shown adverse associations between prenatal
exposure to As and or Cd and birth outcomes including reductions in
birth weight length and head circumference placental weight and
gestational age Saleh et al Esteban Vasallo et al
Kippier et al Laine et al Lin et al Menai
et al Milton et al Quansah et al sun et al
Zhang et al
and a higher risk of preterm delivery Milton et al
Rahman et al Yang et al and SGA
Saleh et al
However few data have been published on
Menai et al
the developmental effects of low to moderate As and Cd exposure
Quansah et al
Although epidemiological studies increasingly support the associa
tion of in utero exposure to Pb and Hg with adverse pregnancy out
comes the evidence is less consistent than for As and Cd especially in
the case of Hg Vrijheid et al Results of studies in populations
with different environmental Pb exposure levels have not been con
clusive in relation to birth size Saleh et al Esteban Vasallo

Conflicting findings have also been observed for Hg and an association
of prenatal exposure to moderate Hg levels with preterm delivery and
reduced size at birth has been found by some authors Saleh et al
Gundacker et al Karagas et al Vigeh et al
but not by others Bashore et al Drouillet
Xue et al
Pinard et al Guo et al Karagas et al
Some essential metals such as manganese Mn and chromium Cr
can also be toxic to humans if present at high levels Excessive prenatal
exposure to Mn has mainly been associated with neurodevelopmental
delay in children Rodriguez Barranco et al However there has
been little research into the effects of prenatal Mn exposure on birth
outcomes and conflicting findings have been published on the asso
ciation with birth size and gestational age
et al Tsai
et al Vigeh et al Zota et al
Likewise there has
been scant investigation of the effects on fetal growth of excessive Cr
levels during pregnancy however two recent studies associated higher
maternal Cr exposure with increased risk of LBW
Xia et al and
preterm delivery
Pan et al
As Pb and Hg can readily pass through the placental barrier from
the maternal bloodstream into the fetal circulation Iyengar and Rapp
as is also the case for Mn Krachler et al and Cr Ziaee
et al
while the placenta is only a partial barrier to the transfer
of Cd
Esteban Vasallo et al Once they have reached the pla
centa these metallic metalloid elements may interfere with placental
transport systems and enzymes affecting the normal placental function
Esteban Vasallo et al Thus given the role of the placenta as a
mediator in the transfer of nutrients and contaminants to the fetus
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
placental biomarkers may provide valuable information on intrauterine
exposure to these potentially toxic elements Moreover the placenta is
readily available and provides information on the exposure of both
mother and fetus Esteban Vasallo et al However few studies
have used the placenta to assess prenatal exposure to metals such as As
Hg or Mn in relation to birth outcomes
Saleh et al
Esteban Vasallo et al
Previous data from the INMA INfancia y Medio Ambiente
Environment and Childhood Project a birth cohort study in Spain
showed that total Hg level in cord blood from newborns was
inversely associated with placental weight and head circumference but
not with the length of gestation Murcia et al Cord blood total
Hg was also associated with a reduced biparietal diameter at weeks
of pregnancy Ballester et al With the above background this
study aimed to examine the association of placental As Cd Pb Hg Mn
and Cr concentrations with birth weight and length head cir
cumference LBW gestational age at birth preterm delivery and SGA in
a sub sample of mother child pairs from the INMA Project There is
increasing evidence that the sex of the newborn may modify the asso
ciation of prenatal exposure to toxic metals with birth outcomes
Kippler et al Lamichhane et al Wang et al
Xia et al and subsequent neurodevelopmental effects
Llop et al However studies on the sex specific effects of pre
natal metal exposure on birth outcomes remain scarce and their results
are controversial Therefore the potential role of sex as modifier of the
studied associations was also evaluated
Methods
Study population
The INMA Project is a multicenter population based cohort study
designed to investigate the effect of environmental exposures and diet
during pregnancy on fetal and child development http www
proyectoinma org The study is composed of seven mother child co
horts established in different geographic areas of Spain Guxens et al
A total of placentas approximately one out of six births
were randomly collected at delivery from five of the INMA cohorts i e
Asturias Gipuzkoa Basque Country Granada Andalusia Sabadell
Catalonia and Valencia from through Participants were
recruited during the first prenatal visit weeks of gestation
in Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and Valencia but at birth
in Granada with a total of babies born to women in
these cohorts All cohorts included male and female newborns except
for Granada which recruited only male newborns The details of the
INMA Project including methods of recruitment and enrollment have
been previously reported Guxens et al Out of the placentas
collected were randomly selected for metal content ana
lysis The present study included mother infant pairs with available
data on placental metal levels anthropometrical measures gestational
age at birth and relevant covariates Information on head cir
cumference was only available for newborns All procedures as
sociated with the INMA study were approved by the institutional re
view boards of the participating centers

Birth outcomes
Data on neonatal anthropometric measurements birth weight in g
and birth length and head circumference in cm were obtained by the
attending midwife or nurse Gestational age was calculated as the
number of weeks from the self reported last menstrual period to the end
of pregnancy In Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and Valencia cohorts
early fetal crown rump length measurement by ultrasound was used to
correct gestational age when the two estimations differed by days or
Murcia et al LBW was defined by a birth weight of
more
less than gat term and preterm birth by live birth before
weeks of pregnancy Newborns were defined as SGA when below the
percentile of the expected weight according to the Spanish birth
weight curve adjusted for gestational age and sex Carrascosa et al
Confounding variables
Socio demographics and lifestyle data were collected by inter
viewer administered questionnaires during the and trimesters of
pregnancy Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and Valencia cohorts or at
the birth Granada cohort Information on the type of delivery ce
sarean or vaginal was obtained from clinical records Variables con
sidered as potential confounders in this study were newborn sex co
hort maternal age maternal and father s education level at delivery
primary secondary or university schooling maternal smoking during
pregnancy yes or no maternal working during pregnancy yes or no
pre pregnancy body mass index BMI parity or and ma
ternal place of residence during pregnancy rural or urban sub urban
Pre pregnancy BMI was obtained by dividing self reported pre preg
nancy weight in kg by the square of the current height and categorized
as underweight normal weight kg or overweight obese
kg Confounding assessment also included parental social
class considering the higher classified maternal or father s occupation
during the pregnancy Social class was categorized as classes I II
higher classes III other non manual classes or IV V manual
classes Additionally the average of mean daily intakes of fish and
seafood reported at and weeks of gestation adjusted for total
caloric intake was considered as the daily intake in g day during the
pregnancy Information on food intake frequency during pregnancy was
gathered from the women in the Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and
Valencia cohorts using a validated semiquantitative questionnaire of
food items Vioque et al Fish intake during pregnancy is
known to be a potential source of fetal exposure to toxic metals
Herreros et al However fish is also a rich source of proteins
vitamins iron and long chain unsaturated fatty acids and its intake
during pregnancy might protect against metal toxicity and adverse birth
outcomes Murcia et al Olsen and Secher
Statistical analysis
Concentrations of As Hg and Pb were below the LD in a high
proportion of samples Therefore we did not impute values LD of
the assays for placental levels of these metals and they were
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
categorized as detected or undetected Cd concentrations LD
of placentas were assigned a value one half of the LD Descriptive data
on placental metal content are shown as detection frequencies median
values and and percentiles of concentrations Spearman s
correlation test was used to assess relationships between Cd Mn and Cr
levels For birth outcomes absolute and relative frequency mean
median and and percentiles were used for descriptive pur
poses Associations of parental characteristics and newborn sex with
birth weight and length gestational age and SGA were examined by
univariate linear and logistic regression and those showing an asso
ciation at p entered a multivariate regression model to identify
predictors of each outcome Variables were retained in the multivariate
model if associated at p with the outcome The covariates as
sociated with birth weight in the multivariate model were newborn sex
maternal smoking or working during pregnancy and pre pregnancy
BMI those associated with birth length were newborn sex and cohort
and those associated with head circumference were newborn sex and
maternal smoking during pregnancy Maternal education alone was a
significant predictor of gestational age while the father s education
maternal working during pregnancy and the variable cohort remained
associated with SGA
Adjusted linear regression models were created to assess the asso
ciation of metal levels with anthropometric parameters and gestational
age at birth Associations with binary outcomes LBW preterm de
livery and SGA were explored by logistic regression Models were
adjusted for outcome predictors and cohort and simultaneously ad
justed for all metals Because a reduction in gestation length is a major
determinant of birth weight models with birth weight LBW birth
length and head circumference were additionally adjusted for gesta
tional age The change in estimate criterion was used to select
confounders for each outcome retaining variables in the final model if
they modified the effect of metal level on outcome b regression coef
ficient by LBW and preterm delivery models were adjusted for
the same covariates as those included in birth weight and gestational
age models respectively Cd Mn and Cr concentrations showed
skewed distributions and were therefore transformed into natural
logarithms before regression analyses Random effect models were used
to report final estimates from the main and sex stratified analyses to
account for the heterogeneity among cohorts Table and
Table
Estimates of models with Cd Mn and Cr and continuous outcomes are
reported as change in outcome for each increase in metal level
while results for logistic regression models are reported as the odds of
each outcome for every increase in placental levels of Cd Mn or

Discussion
In this multicenter cohort study we found some adverse associa
tions between placental metal concentrations and birth size
Specifically Cd level was associated with reduced birth weight and
length in a linear manner and with increasing odds of LBW in the
global sample placental Hg level was related to reduced head cir
cumference in female newborns and Cr level was associated with
reduced birth length in the global sample These associations were in
dependent of gestational age or preterm birth suggesting that exposure
to these metals influences fetal growth Interestingly Cd levels were
associated with a slight increase in gestational age and lower odds of
preterm delivery There was also evidence of positive associations of
Mn with gestational age in males and with head circumference in fe
males and of Cr with gestational age in the global sample
The placental metal levels found in the INMA cohorts fall within the
low intermediate range of previous reports as already described
Amaya et al Freire et al Studies on placental bio
markers of exposure to toxic metals in relation to birth outcomes have
published conflicting results
Saleh et al Esteban
Vasallo et al et al Gundacker et al Guo
et al Kippler et al Llanos and Ronco Ronco et al
Stasenko et al Zhang et al
Thus a large study

gatively associated with head circumference but not with birth weight
or length and that placental Cd or Pb was not related to birth an

Guo et al
and in a small
sample N in Austria Gundacker et al observed no as

cumference finding similar Hg levels as those in our population
and ng g respectively vs ng g In the Austrian study how
ever placental Pb content which was higher than in our study
vs ng g was inversely related to birth weight and length but not

while other studies indicated a relationship between placental Cd and
reduced birth weight Kippler et al Ronco et al Stasenko

Kippler et al In contrast two small studies in China Zhang
and Spain
et al
found no association of

placental Cd and Pb levels which were much higher than in the current
study with birth weight length or head or abdominal circumference
Other studies found no association between placental levels of Hg Pb
or Cd and birth outcomes Esteban Vasallo et al
Cadmium
Because Cd accumulates in the placenta higher Cd levels would be
expected in placentas from longer pregnancies This may explain the
observed positive association with gestational age however this is not
supported by previous findings of no or inverse associations between
placental Cd and gestational age Esteban Vasallo et al
et al Kippler et al Yang et al and the possibility
of residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out Despite its partial
retention in the placenta Cd appeared to exert the most negative effect
on birth size in our study population and placental Cd levels may be an
indicator of maternal smoking during pregnancy

Accordingly placental Cd content was significantly higher in the pre
sent mothers who smoked during pregnancy than in those who did not

However in contrast to our finding a recent

Jacobo Estrada et al Stasenko et al Cd has also
been identified as an endocrine disruptor interfering with the estrogen
receptor Kortenkamp In vitro studies have shown that Cd re
duces the expression of the placental enzyme hydroxysteroid de
hydrogenase type
This enzyme protects the fetus
Yang et al
from high maternal glucocorticoid levels which may lead to fetal
growth restriction and female fetuses have been shown to be more
sensitive than male fetuses to increased glucocorticoid levels Murphy
In this line
Kippier et al
reported that
et al
prenatal Cd exposure in Bangladesh was negatively related to birth
weight and head circumference in females alone and that the asso
ciation with fetal size was stronger for the females Our results do not
support previously published findings of sex specific effects of Cd on
birth size and this issue requires further research
Arsenic
Exposure to high naturally occurring levels of As in drinking water
has been associated with adverse birth outcomes especially a sig
nificant reduction in birth weight Laine et al Milton et al
Quansah et al Rahman et al Several recent studies
in the US have corroborated the association of prenatal As exposure as
measured by drinking water concentration inorganic As and maternal
levels total As with reduced birth weight at lower levels of exposure
Almberg et al Claus Henn et al Gilbert Diamond et al
while some evidence although still inconsistent has suggested
that relatively lower levels of maternal total As are also related to re
duced head circumference Claus Henn et al Gilbert Diamond
et al
In the present study placental total As level was not re
lated to birth size or gestational age probably due to low levels of
exposure especially in the Granada cohort and the fact that As ex
posure in our population was mostly from fish in which As is largely
found in its less toxic organic form
Fort et al
Mercury
Conflicting results have been published on the relationship between
birth outcomes and total Hg levels measured in cord blood or in ma
ternal hair or blood Some authors have reported a relationship with
reduced birth size Saleh et al Gundacker et al Murcia
et al Vigeh et al wells et al
and premature
delivery
Xue et al
whereas others found no association with
birth anthropometry Bashore et al Guo et al Drouillet
Pinard et al Karagas et al or gestation length
Bashore
et al Drouillet Pinard et al Murcia et al Wells
et al
Studies of placental Hg levels have also yielded contra
dictory results Saleh et al Esteban Vasallo et al
The present study provides evidence of a negative effect of
placental Hg on head circumference in females and suggests that the
apparent negative effect on birth length is confounded by maternal fish
intake as previously observed in relation to cord blood Hg in the INMA
study
Murcia et al Some previous studies have reported a
negative association of prenatal Hg exposure with head circumference
Saleh et al Murcia et al Cord blood total Hg levels in
four of the present INMA cohorts were also associated with reduced
head circumference independently of maternal fish intake but no
difference was observed between the sexes Murcia et al It is
noteworthy that a high proportion of the INMA cord blood samples had
elevated levels of total Hg which were influenced by maternal intake of
large oily fish
and were positively correlated with
Llop et al
placental Hg levels data not shown Discrepancies between findings
from INMA and other studies may be attributable to differences in
sample sizes exposure biomarkers degree of Hg exposure or to the
lack of adjustments for maternal fish intake and other relevant con
founders among other factors
The negative association observed between Hg and head cir
cumference in females is consistent with the finding by our previous
investigation of a negative relationship between cord blood Hg and
psychomotor development at year of age in females alone Llop et al
given that birth head circumference may be linked to subsequent
cognitive development Methyl Hg has been found to induce oxidative

tribute to the effects of Hg on impaired fetal growth However further
research is required to elucidate the biological mechanism underlying
the sex specific association observed between Hg exposure and birth
size
Lead
Prenatal Pb exposure is known to affect embryonic development
and is associated with several adverse outcomes from infancy through
adolescence It has been postulated that even low level Pb exposure
may impair infant growth and development Bellinger
How
ever a review in described the epidemiological evidence for an
C Freire et al
association of in utero Pb exposure with fetal growth and preterm birth
as limited
Wigle et al
Since then several studies in populations
with different levels of exposure mostly measured in maternal blood
have reported adverse associations of Pb levels with birth weight
length and head circumference gestational age LBW SGA and pre
term delivery
Gundacker et al Lamichhane et al
Rodosthenous et al Taylor et al Vigeh et al Wang
et al zhu et al
Placental Pb content was low in the
present population especially in younger cohorts confirming previous
INMA findings of cord blood levels several times lower than the
threshold established by the World Health Organization Llop et al
In fact among women with data available on placental and cord
blood Pb N of those with placental Pb levels below the LD
had undetected cord blood Pb As in the case of As the low placental Pb
levels in our study population may explain the apparent lack of an
adverse association between Pb and birth outcomes
Manganese and chromium
Studies addressing prenatal exposure to Mn have shown varied re
sults in relation to fetal growth and gestation length
et al
Tsai et al Vigeh et al Zota et al
with some ex
perimental studies finding reduced fetal weight in pregnant mice ex
posed to Mn Colomina et al Sanchez et al In the present
study there was a positive effect of Mn on gestational age and an ap
parent sex specific effect on increased head circumference which re
mains unclear and warrants further investigation Mn is involved in the
functioning of numerous organ systems and is needed for immune
function digestion and bone growth but excessive Mn exposure is
considered harmful to the fetus Aschner and Aschner However
present results do not appear to support the hypothesis that fetal
growth is favored by lower Mn levels but impaired by elevated levels in
disagreement with the finding by
of an inverse U
Zota et al
shaped relationship between maternal blood Mn and birth weight
Higher urinary Cr levels in Chinese pregnant women from the
general population were associated with an increased risk of LBW in a
case control study
Xia et al
and with shorter gestation length
and greater risk of preterm delivery in a large N cohort study
Pan et al
and these associations seemed to be modified by the
sex of the newborn Pan et al Xia et al In contrast cord
blood Cr levels were not associated with newborns birth size in a recent
study conducted in a non industrialized island in the Canary archipe
Iago Spain Cabrera Rodriguez et al Although the toxicity of Cr
is mainly attributable to the hexavalent form Cr excessive triva
lent Cr Cr which is the biologically active form of Cr may also be
hazardous for health As in the Chinese studies
Pan et al Xia
et al
total Cr levels were recorded in the present investigation
but our results do not support their conclusions because we found that
elevated Cr levels were associated with reduced birth length but longer
gestation The lack of adverse association found in our study between
Cr and other anthropometrical parameters or gestational age may
possibly be due to the low levels of exposure to Cr Cr and Cr in
our study population as also observed in the Canary islands Cabrera
Rodriguez et al
Strengths and limitations
Major strengths of the present study include the relatively large
number of participants in comparison to previous studies on placental
metal levels the adjustment for several confounders the performance
of sensitivity analysis sex stratified analysis adjustment for fish intake
and exclusion of preterm births and the use of the placenta as ex
posure matrix In addition this is one of the few studies to examine Mn
and Cr in relation to birth outcomes Given the accumulation of metals
such as Cd in the placenta during pregnancy it offers a singular op
portunity to assess chronic maternal exposure to toxic chemicals
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
avoiding the need for repeated maternal blood or urinary sampling
Esteban and Castafio Nonetheless the relationship between
this measurement and exposure at critical times during pregnancy re
mains unknown Our study is also limited by the fact that genders were
not equally distributed the Granada cohort recruited only boys
therefore sex specific associations should be interpreted with caution
It should also be taken into account that some significant associations
observed could result from chance because multiple analyses were
performed However some of the statistically significant associations
found were in line with the literature and seem unlikely to be the result
of chance or residual confounding particularly the dose response re
lationships observed for Cd and Mn in relation to birth size Further
more the low numbers of LBW premature and SGA newborns with
available data on placental metal levels likely reduced the precision of
our estimates Finally the measures of birth outcomes were recorded
according to each hospital protocol and our findings may have been
subject to non differential measurement error
Conclusions
This study of Spanish mother child pairs from the general popula
tion found that in utero exposure to Cd and Cr as measured by placental
levels was associated with reduced birth size with no apparent sex
specific effects and that placental Hg was associated with reduced head
circumference in females Although the magnitude of the estimated
effects is not necessarily clinically relevant for newborns the ubiquity
of exposure to these metals especially to Hg through fish intake re
presents an important public health issue Furthermore results ob
tained suggest that Mn exposure may have a beneficial effect on ge
station length and female head circumference and that Cr may also
have a positive impact on gestational length but further investigation is
required to verify this possible effect Larger prospective studies are
also needed to confirm the adverse associations observed and to iden
tify developmental windows of particular susceptibility to potentially
toxic metals

Abstract In Maternal Mortality Rate MMR was still
high especially in Indonesian It had strong a correlation in
Millenium Development Goals to achieve the better quality of
human life Surprisingly most of maternal mortality case is
usually preventable with good quality of knowledge In this day
the use of social media has been increasing In social media
has been using by billion people worldwide and the sixth
highest number of internet user comes from Indonesia Besides
that pregnant women have a tendency to use social media for
seeking out about health information during pregnancy in
prenatal perinatal and postnatal also reproductive health topics
We created Jakpros application a smart mobile application who
designed for women The purpose of it is for serving better health
service and reliable information Our aim in this study is to
analyze how the educational page in Jakpros application can
increase pregnant women knowledge We recruited pregnant
women participant from several sub district hospitals in
Jakarta We detected their knowledge of reproductive health in
pre test questionnaire about basic pregnancy After that we
guided them to download Jakpros application on their mobile
phone We asked them to use it in weeks and we were seeing
their knowledge in post test The observational analytics study was
using cross sectional and analyzed by SPSS to see the
differences in knowledge Their knowledge has been increasing
after they used the educational page feature in weeks Along with
this era Jakpros application is an effective platform for making
pregnant women is more educable

I INTRODUCTION
Maternal mortality rate MMR in Indonesia was still high
In we found out mortality cases of live births
As we knew MMR is one of Millenium Goals Development
important indicator to achieve the better quality human life and
health in the world In the global target has a goal to
decrease MMR until less than cases To achieve the goals we
have to know the main factor who plays an important role The
past study showed that the pregnant women educational level is
correlated with their mortality and health status during
USAID SHERA SMART CITY
pregnancy Meanwhile many of the mortality cases are actually
can be detected and prevented in the earlier stage at least one
quarter until one half cases Indirectly knowledgeable people is
more awareness and have a tendency for getting better health
than people who do not
Social media has been using by billion worldwide users
in The number is predicted to increase in In this
era people have frequently used the internet for seeking out
information especially in young women Related to it pregnancy
is stressful moment and pregnant women had a tendency to use
the internet to get another experience and opinion We could
see that social media as an effective tool for giving knowledge
and as a platform for health promotion for preventing
Pregnant women often to use it of convenience and the low cost
effectiveness access Furthermore it makes many new invention
in making mobile health application who especially designed for
women
In We created the Jakpros application Jakarta
Reproduksi Sehat Jakpros is a smart mobile health application
who designed for women For making Jakpros application it
needed framework who connect to build up a mobile hybrid
applications with CSS and AngularJS Furthermore
Web Browser was using for development and Google Chrome
to debug it Currently Jakpros application is only available in
Android We can simply get it by download from Google play
store and the cost is free The purpose of the Jakpros application
is for giving our patient convenience in communicate and access
information We would like to explain the feature in it First the
educational page is a feature to get reproductive health
information such as prenatal care cervical cancer prevention
high risk pregnancy and contraception knowledge The
educational page display was a pictorial article and easy to read
with language that is understood by the patient In this
application we served information from the reliable obstetrician
and gynecologist doctor and the patient does not have to worried
about credibility The second feature is the question and answers

III RESULTS
One hundred and sixty six pregnant women from several
Sub District Public Hospital in Jakarta assessed to this study
For the beginning participants who did not require the
criteria were exclusion We conducted participants who
assessed to this study After that they signed in the informed
consent and answered a pre test questionnaire In the next days
after weeks they used this application we collected them to fill
out the post test questionnaire and participants were drop out
of in this study Our total sampling was participants There
were no specific follow up in this study In table I we could see
the study was dominated by women in years old
Most of the participant educational level was college and above
had islam religion housewife and married
women We conducted questions in multiple choice
answer consisted of anemia nutrition and high pregnancy In
this paper we showed you the right answer and their answered
Table II In the first question we asked What is anemia
means this purpose of this question was to detect their basic
knowledge in it Most of the participants did not know the
definition of anemia In the the pre test around of them
answered anemia as decreased of red blood cells and
participants answered anemia as decreased of hemoglobin In
the post test there was an increase in the hemoglobin answer
Second question was about How much calcium needs
during pregnancy most of them answered that need mg
per day calcium each day The right question was answered by
in pre test and in post test We asked the benefit
of amino acid for the third question We knew the answer was
for fetal brain development and most of them answer it correctly
in to Fourth participant answered that
pregnant women need mg day calories in weeks of
pregnancy the pre test was just answered for the right
Even though they did not know in anemia definition they
understood hemoglobin as an important role for hemoglobin
formation Pre test was and post test was After the
antenatal care question then we asked high risk pregnancy
question Most of them answer right answer since the pre test
and has been increasing in the post test We found out increased
rate was from to in the post test for high risk
pregnancy early sign Furthermore in the pre test
participant answered seizure as the sign of eclampsia and it was
significantly changed in post test around Then they
could recognize that weight gain during pregnancy more than I
kg in one week was abnormal We have seen an increased rate
from to Dyspnea was a sign in heart disease
answered by in the pre test and in post test For
the last question there were increased in answer for the
placenta previa sign
In Table III we used Wilcoxon test and see the overall
difference of the pre and post test P was statistically
significant We focused to analyze the correlation between their
score in educational level and job Figure III I V with Kruskal

more aware if they understand in it They could detect early sign
ofdisease and will lead them to right decision Furthermore they
would do antenatal care regularly and keep their lifestyle to
prevent unwanted things
We found out people with a higher education background
and had other jobs e g entrepreneur and freelancer were
having a better in basic reproductive knowledge In the past
study was shown that people with higher education have a
tendency to get better knowledge due to experience and ease of
access Therefore there was still an increase in other
educational background and other jobs after using it in daily
In our study we could not judge yet that knowledge would
change their behavior too Two weeks periods of this study
cannot explain in more detail about it Overmore lack of follow
up and do they read from other sources are our limitation in this
study However we found out that pregnant women knowledge
could be increased through the educational page feature in
Jakpros application
CONCLUSION
We found the educational page feature in Jakpros mobile
health application had the positive benefit in serving
reproductive health knowledge In addition knowledge could
make pregnant women more aware of their condition during
pregnancy and be able to prevent unwanted things Jakpros
application is helping the doctor to spread reliable information
The further study is needed to see do the changes in knowledge
will be followed by changes in behavior In the next day we
hope Jakpros application will reveal and contribute for
decreasing Indonesian Maternal Mortality Rate

using Jakpros in the second week There was a change in their
knowledge even though did not significantly The previous
study found that reproduction health knowledge was used as a
first step to decrease the maternal mortality rate Besides that
among the other factor knowledge is the easiest way to

The reduction of maternal mortality and the promotion of maternal health and wellbeing are complex tasks This
Series paper analyses the distal and proximal determinants of maternal health as well as the exposures risk factors
and micro correlates related to maternal mortality This paper also examines the relationship between these
determinants and the gradual shift over time from a pattern of high maternal mortality to a pattern of low maternal
mortality a phenomenon described as the maternal mortality transition We conducted two systematic reviews of the
literature and we analysed publicly available data on indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals
specifically estimates prepared by international organisations including the UN and the World Bank We considered
frameworks depicting maternal health and wellbeing as a multifactorial process with superdeterminants that
broadly affect women s health and wellbeing before during and after pregnancy We explore the role of social
determinants of maternal health individual characteristics and health system features in the production of maternal
health and wellbeing This paper argues that the preventable deaths of millions of women each decade are not solely
due to biomedical complications of pregnancy childbirth and the postnatal period but are also tangible manifestations
of the prevailing determinants of maternal health and persistent inequities in global health and socioeconomic
development This paper underscores the need for broader multipronged actions to improve maternal health and
wellbeing and accelerate sustainable reductions in maternal mortality For women who have pregnancy childbirth or
postpartum complications the health system provides a crucial opportunity to interrupt the chain of events that can
potentially end in maternal death Ultimately expanding the health sector ecosystem to mitigate maternal health
determinants and tailoring the configuration of health systems to counter the detrimental effects of eco social forces
including though increased access to quality assured commodities and services are essential to improve maternal
health and wellbeing and reduce maternal mortality
Introduction
In world leaders committed to promoting peace
prosperity health and global cooperation to ensure
the sustainability of human civilisation by setting
the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs However
emerging priorities such as the COVID pandemic
with its evolving consequences the pressing climate
emergency conflicts and political instabilities have
competed for attention and resources In this context
previous and persistent challenges such as maternal
mortality risk being neglected At the halfway mark to
the goal of reaching a global maternal mortality ratio
MMR of maternal deaths per livebirths
remains elusive with maternal deaths per live
births reported in This figure is much less than the
MMR for which was maternal deaths per
livebirths However since the MMR has
decreased in only two regions central and south Asia and
Australia and New Zealand Sub Saharan Africa Oceania
excluding Australia and New Zealand east and southeast
Asia and north Africa all experienced a stagnation in the
MMR During this time period the MMR increased in
Europe North America Latin America and the Caribbean
The reported stagnation in global MMR is an urgent
matter an estimated women died from causes

related to pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum
period in alone The preventable loss of almost
million lives of women between and is not
only a global tragedy but also an indicator of gross health
inequality between and within countries and a flagrant
human rights violation Despite the large gains made in
many countries in terms of improved agency education
employment and fertility desires for women these
advances have not been universal most maternal
deaths remain preventable and are largely clustered
among groups of socioeconomically disadvantaged
women Disease outbreaks conflicts and other public
health emergencies aggravate the situation by increasing
the risk of pregnancy complications disrupting health
systems and posing additional constraints to maternal
and perinatal healthcare
The most common approach to tackling maternal
mortality by the global community has been to direct
investments to address the leading biomedical causes of
maternal death particularly during the perinatal period
Compared with biomedical causes less attention has been
paid to the underlying determinants of adverse pregnancy
and childbirth outcomes and how health systems could be
configured to implement effective interventions and
mitigate the adverse effects of social factors on maternal

Key messages
Maternal health is a social issue maternal ill health and disability are not just medical
problems but outcomes of a complex interplay of eco social forces lifestyles and
exposures and individual level factors
Focusing solely on biomedical causes of maternal mortality is insufficient and has
possibly been the cause of many countries remaining at the same maternal mortality
transition stage for decades out of countries analysed have been in the same
maternal mortalitytransition stage for years
Addressing maternal health issues and reducing maternal mortality are complex
endeavours due to both modifiable and unmodifiable factors that affect outcomes
a broad multipronged approach including promotion of social development and
gender equality at national level will be necessary to tackle determinants that act
upstream in the chain of events that leads to severe morbidity and death
The health sector has a crucial role in saving the lives of women with pregnancy
labour or postpartum complications and should be expanded to mitigate the
detrimental effects of maternal health determinants
Expanding demand for and access to high quality reproductive health services and
commodities including safe abortion modern contraception and antenatal
intrapartum and postpartum care are needed for primary prevention early
identification and adequate management of pregnancy labour and postpartum
complications
Achieving universal health coverage is essential to ensure access to quality care during
pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum period and to reduce maternal mortality

health Although pre existing medical conditions eg
chronic anaemia chronic hypertension diabetes are a
growing concern direct obstetric complications such as
postpartum haemorrhage pre eclampsia and infection
remain the leading biomedical causes of maternal
mortality The necessary technologies commodities and
services to effectively reduce maternal mortality already
exist Mortality could be substantially reduced if quality
assured maternal health commodities and services were
consistently available and if unwanted pregnancies were
prevented in the first place by increasing access to modern
contraception
However an exclusive focus on maternal mortality
could be restrictive because surviving pregnancy is no
longer suffcient to achieve the global targets related to
maternal health Beyond survival the focus in
maternal health is evolving towards promoting health
and wellbeing across the life course This expanded focus
requires a holistic and integrative approach centred on a
positive experience of care The integrative efforts
towards the SDGs are intentionally designed to converge
and align with this broader vision for maternal health a
world in which all women have the highest possible level
of health and wellbeing during pregnancy and beyond
Therefore a rapid acceleration of global efforts to
improve maternal health is required if the SDG targets
are to be met by and the promise ofa better world
for all is to be realised
For this first paper in the Series on maternal health in
the perinatal period and beyond we conducted a
systematic analysis of the determinants of maternal
health and factors associated with maternal mortality and
examined the relationship between these determinants
and the gradual shift over time from a pattern of high
maternal mortality to a pattern of low maternal mortality
a phenomenon described as the obstetric transition or
maternal mortality transition The appendix presents
the methods used in this analysis together with additional
information Our aim was to provide a broad overarching
conceptualisation of distal and proximal determinants
that shape maternal health outcomes to enable an
informed reflection on the appropriate strategies to
accelerate countries transition from high to low maternal
mortality burden stages We hope this paper together
with the other papers in the Series on vulnerability during
pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum period
neglected medium term and long term complications
following labour and childbirth and an intersectional
approach to address maternal health
highlights often overlooked yet crucial pathways to
accelerate progress to end preventable maternal deaths
and improve maternal health and wellbeing In this
paper the terms woman and women are used to
reflect all populations with the reproductive capacity for
pregnancy and birth including transgender and gender
diverse people as well as adolescent girls
Maternal health as the product of a
multifactorial process
We reviewed the literature for conceptual frameworks of
the determinants of maternal health appendix p We
identified frameworks portraying maternal health and
wellbeing as the result ofa multifactorial process appendix
p The core themes or elements commonly found in the
included frameworks are summarised in the figure This
figure presents a high level illustration of a health
production process in which eco social forces ie elements
of the superdeterminants and social determinants
described in the next section and contexts as well as
individual level factors and lifestyle patterns substantially
contribute to maternal health and wellbeing The panel
lists the core themes we identified informed by our
multisource literature review it maps the factors associated
with maternal mortality and severe morbidity appendix
p In the following sections we use the factors identified
from this literature review to further describe and elaborate
on the connections and interdependencies of the key
forces illustrated in the figure
Superdeterminants and social determinants of
maternal health
The superdeterminants of maternal health are the
underlying contexts and forces that broadly influence
the health and wellbeing of women before during
and after pregnancy These mutually interacting
superdeterminants include the characteristics of the
biosphere eg climate ecosystem biological features of
the human species eg the endocrinology of human
wwvv thelancet com lancetgh Vol February
parturition and the anatomy of the female pelvis and
the economic political and cultural bases of societies
eg health insurance policies and health budgetary
allocations health care policies and legislations on
reproductive rights and access to care societal norms
and expectations related to gender roles and cultural
beliefs surrounding pregnancy and childbirth The
evolution of modern humans Homo sapiens has largely
been shaped by the characteristics of the environment
This evolution is an ongoing process driven by natural
selection and other mechanisms in which traits and
characteristics that offer advantages for survival and
reproduction become sustained in populations over
time Characteristics such as the shape of the female
pelvis and the complex endocrinology of human
parturition which underlie the biological and
physiological bases of pregnancy labour and childbirth
are responsible for reproductive success as well as
challenges that persist across generations Adaptation
to different environmental challenges over time
encouraged the development of social structures and
cooperative behaviours culminating in a diverse range of
cultural practices social norms political structures and
economies across different contexts As the dominant
species on the planet the activities of humans over time
such as deforestation industrialisation and pollution
have had profound effects on the environment These
behaviours have led to disruptions in ecosystems loss of
biodiversity escalating and more frequent climate events
such as heat waves droughts and floods and the
emergence of new health threats including zoonotic
diseases eg COVID all with detrimental effects on
maternal survival and wellbeing Although applicable
to other health areas the combination of intrinsic
biological and behavioural characteristics of human
beings the manifestations of human interactions with
the environment and society s cultural political and
economic adaptations are superdeterminants with
substantial effects on maternal and perinatal health
The social determinants of health are derived from
economic political and cultural superdeterminants and
are defined as the non biomedical factors that influence
health risks and outcomes throughout life With regard
to maternal health social determinants of health are the
conditions in which women are born grow work and live
before pregnancy and during pregnancy childbirth and
the postpartum period These social determinants
substantially affect maternal health outcomes and are
indirectly responsible for the disparities observed in
maternal mortality and morbidity rates between different
populations The list of social determinants of maternal
health in the literature is extensive but the importance
of structural biases related to gender ethnicity and
socioeconomic class cannot be overemphasised
Gender disparities income education ethnicity and
race are strong predictors of death and disability
during pregnancy childbirth the postpartum period and

Figure Maternal health production process
The diagram illustrates the relationships and interdependencies of
superdeterminants showing how the characteristics of the planet shape biological
and physiological evolution of reproduction in human species Homo sapiens and
how continual adaptations of humans to the planet culminate into cultural
practices social norms and political and economic systems that influence the
contexts in which pregnancy and childbirth takes place social determinants as
well as the individual level traits lifestyle patterns and exposures to external
agents The resultant effect of these forces on maternal health and wellbeing
depends on the efficiency of the health system at neutralising detrimental forces
and enhancing beneficial ones In this representation exposures and lifestyles are
influenced both by individual factors and social determinants The performance of
the health system is also dependent on superdeterminants and influenced by
individual level factors and social determinants
beyond Discrimination systemic bias and social
injustice are frequently associated with poor maternal
outcomes for racial and ethnic minority women for
instance a health care system that routinely minimises
the pain reported by Black women is more likely to miss
warning signs for severe morbidity Apart from the
direct effects of exposure to conflicts and other forms
of violence on pregnant women conflict induced
displacement and forced migration are recognised
disruptors of health care systems and infrastructure
restricting access to life saving maternal health services
and causing severe psychological stress and trauma for
pregnant and postnatal women Women who are
migrants and pregnant have to navigate several barriers to
access care in host countries such as language immigrant

The three delay model was proposed by Thaddeus and Maine and explores how delays
affect the interval between the onset of obstetric complication and its outcome
accidents resulting in physical trauma and injuries have
varying degrees of detrimental effects on maternal
health outcomes depending on a woman s unique
circumstances and level of exposures Violence against
women deserves special mention although violence is
often more visible in conflict affected areas the effects
on pregnancy outcomes are equally devastating even in
non conflict areas particularly when perpetrated by an
intimate partner As a result of the influence of
superdeterminants of maternal health particularly
cultural political and economic systems individual
level factors that are shaped by family and community
characteristics tend to give rise to lifestyle patterns
which in turn mitigate or elevate the risk of dying or
having pregnancy related ill health Examples of
lifestyle patterns with substantial effects on maternal
health include diet eg low iron and low calcium intakes
increase the risk of iron deficiency anaemia and pre
eclampsia respectively physical activity substance use
and smoking and sexual behaviours during pregnancy

Interplay between maternal health determinants and
the concept of embodi ment
The pregnant woman is at the centre of a dynamic
and multifaceted web of interactions between
superdeterminants
social determinants and her
individual level factors exposures and lifestyle pattern
These determinants operate at several levels and are
interconnected and inter related with each factor
continuously influencing and being influenced by others
leading to a resultant effect that collectively shapes
maternal health outcomes throughout pregnancy
childbirth and the postpartum period For example the
climate and environment in which pregnant women live
can affect their health both directly by modifying their
individual level factors and exposures and indirectly by
disrupting their social support structures and health
systems Extreme weather events poor air and water
quality and exposure to pollutants can directly or indirectly
influence maternal health outcomes Cultural norms
surrounding pregnancy and childbirth shape maternal
health behaviours and health care seeking practices by
acting as modifiers of individual level factors such as age
to start a family number of children to have and to what
extent the partner is involved in care of the woman
Cultural factors also influence decisions on nutrition
antenatal care practices and childbirth practices Societal
expectations and gender roles can affect pregnant women s
autonomy access to education resources and health care
and influence their decision making power within their
households as well as their ability to make decisions about
their own health where they work and what they do
Lifestyle patterns arising from social determinants can
influence individual level factors by initiating or
exacerbating pre existing conditions that have serious
effects on maternal health For example low income
status can result in poor nutritional intake or unhealthy
dietary practices and consequently increased risks of
pre pregnancy deficiency anaemia or maternal obesity
Maternal obesity can increase the risk of gestational
diabetes and an unhealthy diet during pregnancy can
contribute to excessive maternal weight gain leading to
various complications including gestational diabetes
Similarly unresolved anaemia during pregnancy has
detrimental effects on the growing fetus and predisposes
the pregnant woman to adverse outcomes including
postpartum haemorrhage and death
Lifestyle pattern and the health care system can also
affect the interaction of factors and converge as a net
force that influences overall maternal outcomes However
lifestyles and the configuration ofa health system are also
products of the prevailing context and social forces the
capacity and resilience of a health system reflect the state
of social development Intersections between factors
particularly gender ethnicity and socioeconomic class
www thelancet com lancetgh Vol February
Series
are highly relevant in determining inequities in income
affecting the quality of care a woman can access
education affecting how informed a woman is about her
choices during pregnancy and childbirth and personal
agency affecting how able a woman is to advocate for
her needs
Thus this complex interplay of forces might produce
concrete events that substantially disrupt maternal
physical and mental health For example take a woman
born and raised in poverty with little access to education
income good nutrition and family planning methods
At an older age as a multiparous pregnant woman with
nutritional anaemia she faces severe bleeding after
giving birth to a stillborn baby Despite the use of
uterotonics she only survives a postpartum haemorrhage
event due to an emergency hysterectomy However she
sustains prolonged disability related to severe maternal
morbidity in addition to the grief of losing a child her
family is forced further into poverty by the large out of
pocket expenses for the complications she experienced
Thus the whole process can be understood as a process
of embodiment in which women internalise and embed
into their bodies and minds the interactions between
their being and the surrounding context and external and
internal forces That is the pregnant woman embodies
the intersections of complex multidimensional forces
Embodiment in the context of maternal health refers to
the integration of the physical social psychological and
cultural aspects of a woman s lived experiences and how
these factors collectively influence her health and
wellbeing throughout the pregnancy journey and beyond
The concept of embodiment recognises that maternal
health is not solely determined by biomedical factors that
underlie pregnancy events but is deeply shaped by the
broader context in which pregnancy occurs
Specific factors associated with maternal mortality and
morbidity ie direct and indirect causes of mortality and
morbidity represent concrete expressions of the context
and the forces described earlier which might progress
with additional complications and organ dysfunctions
the final common pathway to maternal mortality panel
Suicide femicide and other external causes of death
during pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum period
might follow a distinct and similarly complex path but
also represent the embodiment of the interplay between
underlying social forces eg the patriarchy and other
gender social norms and individual family and
community factors This complexity highlights the
reduced agency many women still experience in their
maternal health trajectory a constraint that is often
observed in low income settings
The various individual level factors lifestyles social
forces and their intersections affect the emergence of
biomedical and other factors that ultimately determine
maternal survival and wellbeing during a woman s
pregnancy journey The resultant effect of all these forces
is dependent on how effcient the health system is at
Series
neutralising any detrimental forces and enhancing those
that are beneficial
The role of the health system in maternal health
The health system plays a crucial role in shaping the
embodiment of the inter related forces and contexts
presented earlier Health services and commodities eg
quality assured uterotonics to reduce postpartum blood
loss in a woman who presents with anaemia at the time
of birth can modify the effects of eco social forces that
lead to adverse maternal health outcomes Therefore the
health system can be considered a decisive protective
factor able to neutralise or minimise the effects of
detrimental risk factors Accordingly the negative effects
of some risk factors such as advanced maternal age or
low income status can be attenuated by well functioning
health services particularly those with high quality
preconception antenatal intrapartum and postpartum
care
In this context quality of care emerges as a central
attribute of health services that can exert a protective
effect on maternal health Quality is a multidimensional
concept translated into maternity services as the interplay
of available human resources infrastructure com
modities and effcient processes producing a positive
care experience for the woman and favourable health
outcomes at an acceptable cost However and often due
to poor quality of care health services might not be able
to modify or counterbalance adverse social determinants
individual level factors lifestyles and exposures The
default health system configuration in many low resource
settings features inadequate or suboptimal equipment for
screening and diagnosis health care worker shortages or
competency challenges inadequate use of effective
maternal health interventions or a combination of these
problems which together coalesce into the so called too
little too late situation ll Preventable deaths continue if
the chain of events leading to maternal mortality is not
interrupted For instance pre eclampsia is easy and
inexpensive to diagnose and potentially preventable with
health care commodities eg aspirin however the
underdiagnosis of pre eclampsia and underuse of
preventive measures continue to drive pre eclampsia
related mortality and morbidity in low resource settings
Furthermore health services can be influenced by social
forces For example disrespect abuse and mistreatment
of women within maternity services often reflect gender
ethnic or social class biases against women and are
perpetrated by health care providers many of whom are
women and themselves affected by the same forces and
hierarchies within the health services
Although health systems have the potential to attenuate
adverse health factors they can also cause hazards
Complications of health interventions ie iatrogenic
factors are an important contributor to all cause
mortality and a substantial cause Ofor contributing factor
to maternal mortality Health interventions are
designed and implemented to improve situations in
which the anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks
For example a medically indicated caesarean section can
be a life saving intervention and the underuse of
caesarean section is associated with poor maternal and
perinatal health outcomes However when health
interventions are implemented in situations with
relatively low risk of adverse outcomes their benefits
might not outweigh their risks and indeed could lead to
harm The same intervention applied to a situation with
a lower risk of adverse outcomes might have a different
result For example the short term and long term
complications of a non medically indicated caesarean
section outweigh the potential benefits for both the
woman and the baby Ensuring rational use of caesarean
sections is of great importance especially in settings
without reliable access to safe surgery Promoting the
rational use of health interventions and preventing
interventions that are not medically justified ie
quaternary prevention nor desired by the informed care
recipient can be a strong complement to quality of care
good health outcomes and a positive care experience
In addition using non medically indicated health
interventions can be a substantial resource drain for
both society and the individual that could further
complicate subsequent pregnancies especially in
resource constrained settings
Maternal health determinants and transitions in
maternal mortality
Despite the substantial number of maternal deaths every
year there is a slow but steady trend towards maternal
mortality reduction This trend means that over an
extended time period the absolute number of maternal
deaths and the global MMR are gradually reducing The
first worldwide estimates in the and early
indicated nearly maternal deaths per year Three
decades later the world has almost halved that incidence
there were an estimated maternal deaths in
Countries with reliable maternal mortality data
since the mid or earlier also show similar trends
Building on demographic
epidemiological and
nutritional transitions a transition model to describe
the gradual shift from a pattern of high maternal
mortality to a pattern of low maternal mortality at the
country level was developed by Souza and colleagues
Based on the notion that maternal health is the product
of a multifactorial process as described earlier this
transition model relates levels of maternal mortality to
social development reproductive health indicators
biomedical causes of maternal mortality and the
organisation and quality of health care The central
hypothesis of this transition model is that social
development offers protection from or mitigation of the
detrimental effects of distal and proximal determinants
producing a trend towards maternal mortality reduction
In other words as social development advances maternal
wwvv thelancet com lancetgh Vol February
mortality tends to decrease The maternal mortality
transition stage of a country could therefore be
conceptualised as the net result of the dynamic balance
between the predominant forces of determinants and the
advancements in social development to counteract these
forces
Although the mortality transition model describes a
continuous process stages within the model are used to
identify patterns associated with the level of maternal
mortality in various countries To propose the stages of
the transition model we adopted the MMR cutoffs used
in the WHO UNICEF UNFPA and the World Bank
report on trends in maternal mortality from to
Stage was proposed as a very high maternal
mortality stage MMR maternal deaths per
livebirths stage represents high maternal
mortality MMR stage represents inter
mediate maternal mortality MMR and stage
represents low and very low maternal mortality
MMR IOO A theoretical stage in which hypothetically
all preventable maternal deaths have been prevented is
also included The MMR cutoff for stage is diffcult to
determine but one could hypothesise it to be less than
one maternal death per livebirths since maternal
mortality enquiries in countries with low and very low
maternal mortality ie those in stage and continue
to show potential preventability of maternal deaths The
Series
acknowledged as arbitrary as they are principally used to
illustrate the flow of countries across typologies of social
and health development Nevertheless the depicted
stages are pointers to predominant eco social forces and
levels of social development and can be useful to explore
broader multifaceted strategies to tackle maternal health
challenges at the country level table Notably several
stages of transition might co exist within the same
country

health system is small low universal health coverage low
skilled birth attendance coverage high risk of
impoverishing expenditure for surgical care and very low

Key attributes of maternal health determinants
Environmental and climate effects are moderate to serious with low environmental protection and no
climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are prevalent Violence conflicts internal displacements and political instability are
common The economy is weak and not resilient to external forces Gender discrimination structural
bias and poor social development are common The health system is weak and can be influenced by the
effects of social forces allowing embodiment of overwhelming biomedical factors underlying maternal
death and morbidity
Environmental and climate effects are moderate to serious with some environmental protection and
few climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are less prevalent than stage Violence conflicts internal displacements and political
instability are less common than stage The economy is more stable and resistant to external forces
compared with stage Effects of gender discrimination and structural bias are increasingly addressed by
social development programmes The health system is stronger and less permeable to the effects of
social forces compared with previous stages however the health system struggles with care for women
with obstetric emergencies pre existing risk factors and exposures to external agents associated with
maternal death and morbidity
Environmental and climate effects are moderate with several environmental protection and some
climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are rare Violence conflicts internal displacements and political instability are rare
The economy is strong and fairly resistant to external forces Gender discrimination and structural bias
are addressed by social development programmes but gaps persist Health system is stronger and more
resistant to the effects of social forces compared with previous stages
Environmental and climate effects are minimal with robust environmental protection and climate
adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to maternal health
are non existent Violence conflicts internal displacements or political instability are practically
non existent The economy is very strong robust and resilient to external forces Social development
prevails over gender discrimination and other structural biases The health system is very strong and
resistant to the effects of social forces and it is configured to address rare or emerging complications
leaving no one behind
Series
Table presents the characteristics of the transition
stages As the transition stage progresses to higher levels
and maternal mortality decreases there are decreasing
trends for neonatal maternal mortality fertility rate
and risk of impoverishing expenditure for surgical
care In addition reduction of maternal mortality is
associated with increases in life expectancy universal
health coverage skilled birth attendance antenatal care
coverage and the human development index The
neonatal mortality rate shows a strong correlation
with maternal mortality suggesting that this indicator is
most probably a product of similar determinants

correlate strongly with maternal mortality levels
demonstrating the crucial role of health systems in
safeguarding maternal health against external forces In
contrast the less strong correlations between other social
indicators eg Gini index that measures national income
or wealth distribution and maternal mortality suggests
that the relationship is more distant possibly indirect or
mediated by other factors
Caesarean section rate as an indicator deserves further
consideration which is beyond the scope of our analysis
Notably countries with high and very high maternal
mortality in maternal mortality transition stages and
showed a very low median caesarean section rate at the
country level ie a caesarean section rate well below
This finding suggests that underuse of this intervention
might have a contributory role in maternal mortality
However the relationship between caesarean section rate
and maternal mortality at the country level is not linear
The correlation between caesarean section rate and
maternal mortality is only moderate O and might
be subject to an upper limit as countries with low and
very low maternal mortality presented similar median
caesarean section rates at the country level in the range
of table
This multifactorial causal pathway makes the collective
goal to reduce maternal mortality a complex endeavour
due to the absence of a single solution Although maternal
mortality is a complex issue resources allocated to address
it are often disproportionately low

countries according to MMR levels aims to identify
patterns of determinants that would be more influential
in each stage of transition Such stratification might have
several limitations which should be considered
Nonetheless a typology of transition stages derived from
tables and is presented in table These transition
stages their characteristics and key attributes of maternal
health determinants could be some of the several pieces of
information used in developing multisectoral strategies to
improve maternal health and wellbeing
Conclusions and recommendations for policy
and research
Maternal ill health and disability are social problems
and maternal mortality is a social tragedy The reduction
of maternal mortality and the promotion of maternal
health and wellbeing are complex endeavours This
paper in the Series on maternal health describes the deep
connections between maternal health outcomes and
modifiable and unmodifiable factors that are often
ignored in intervention programmes because of their
complexity Tackling maternal mortality will require
broader actions that go beyond biomedical causes which
manifest at a late stage in the events between a healthy
state and severe morbidity or death Policy makers
particularly those in countries with high maternal
mortality burden must recognise that the main
biomedical causes eg postpartum haemorrhage pre
eclampsia infection and abortion of preventable
maternal deaths do not happen in isolation That
countries have remained in the same mortality
transition bracket for the past two decades is therefore
unsurprising For countries to progress across transition
stages in their mortality reduction efforts there must be
renewed focus on strategies to address the underlying
determinants described in the previous sections
Multisectoral action to promote social development and
gender equality is necessary for sustainable reduction in
maternal mortality Although the implementation of
these strategies eg improvements in social infrastructure
and other social transformation programmes is often
slow to realise their longer term benefits are reasonably
certain
In this context the health sector has a pivotal role to play
Social aspects aside actions taken by the health system at
the health service level represent a final opportunity to
save the lives and improve the health and wellbeing of
women who have birth related complications Expanding
the health sector ecosystem and care networks to mitigate
the detrimental effects of distal and proximal determinants
will substantively improve maternal health Expanding
demand for and increasing access to high quality
reproductive health services and commodities eg modern
contraception safe abortion and antenatal intrapartum
and postpartum care are needed for primary prevention
Series
coverage and strengthening the health system to provide
quality care is essential to reduce maternal mortality and
promote maternal health and wellbeing
Future research should aim to establish the correlation
between key determinants and stages of the maternal
mortality transition at national or regional levels to
facilitate evidence informed and individually tailored
strategies and rapidly accelerate countries towards a very
low maternal mortality transition stage

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Youth in foster care are often excluded from participating in planning for their permanent homes and making
other decisions about their lives In the past decade there has been an increasing call for laws policies and
practices that ensure a youth s right to participation in child welfare and other youth serving systems Child
welfare which is often associated with trauma lack of power and other disadvantages for involved families is a
complicated context for engaging youth in the processes intended to protect them From the motivational
perspective of Self Determination Theory SDT child welfare workers can understand promoting engagement as
creating conditions that meet a youth s basic psychological needs The current study used SDT as a framework to
analyze in depth interviews with youth about their experiences with family case planning meetings Findings
explain why different family meeting practices promoted or undermined youth engagement by creating certain
contextual conditions warm caring structured predictable and supportive of genuine preferences Some
family meeting practices functioned differently in promoting youth engagement depending on the extent to
which youth experienced their needs being met SDT offers both a way to understand casework practices in terms
of the conditions they create and a framework for reflecting on why certain practices operate in different ways
for different youth Workers who understand that engagement stems from meeting individual needs will be better
able to promote youth participation in family meetings and their well being
Historically youth s opinions have not been highly valued nor seen
as necessary for making decisions about their futures

principles for improvement e g prioritize youth voice challenge
inherent power imbalances enhance capacity of workforce to hear and
act on youth voice that heavily depend on the understanding skill and
power afforded to workers Child welfare workers here referred to as
caseworkers are expected to create conditions that support youth
voice and inclusion yet there is relatively little theory and empirical
evidence that explains how casework practices create conditions that
promote youth engagement in permanency planning especially from
the youth s perspective Dillon Greenop Hills Woodman

participation are often discussed synonymously in the literature e g

Salazar et al however the spectrum of youth participation spans
from manipulation adults represent their own agendas through the
guise of youth perspectives to authentic participation youth initiated
shared decision making with adults Ramey Lawford Vachon
From a motivational perspective engagement is conceptually
similar to authentic youth participation which requires sharing power
and information ongoing participation in decision making processes
and a genuine consideration of a youth s perspectives Franklin
Although engagement
Sloper Vis Strandbu Thomas
can be challenging in the hierarchal child welfare system where adults
child welfare workers attorneys etc usually define concerns and
make decisions it should be understood as a right for youth and as a
duty for child welfare workers

Relatedness is the need for connection with others feeling like
others care about you and having a sense of belonging and worth
Spending time with people who are warm and caring creates conditions
that meet one s need for relatedness whereas indifferent rejecting or
hostile interactions with a social partner can thwart this need
Competence is the need to feel effective in your ability to produce
desired outcomes learn new skills or to understand information In
teractions that offer structure and predictability e g clear communica
tion reliability responsiveness create conditions that meet one s need
for competence In contrast experiences that create chaos and uncer
tainty will fail to meet this need
Autonomy is the need to express your authentic self direct your own
action and have a sense of control Experiences that make room for and
support one s genuine preferences worldview and choices create con
ditions that meet one s need for autonomy On the other hand feeling
coerced or disregarded by a social partner can frustrate this need
SDT suggests that if an individual s three basic needs are met they
are more likely to be emotionally behaviorally and or cognitively
engaged in a given context and go on to experience greater well being
In the current study we

define engagement as a youth feeling involved persistent focused and

Skinner Kindermann Connell Well
during their family case planning meetings SDT s focus on
born
needs fulfillment implies that the process of engagement should be
individualized because caseworker practices i e interactions with
youth during family meetings function differently depending on the
extent to which the practices create conditions that meet the youth s
needs For example frequent in person contact with their caseworker
might create warm and caring conditions for one youth which meets
their need for relatedness and therefore encourages engagement On the
other hand another youth could feel overwhelmed with too much in
person contact which would thwart their need for relatedness and un
dermine their engagement
Using SDT to organize the current literature on promoting youth
engagement
As described SDT defines contextual conditions that meet three
basic needs warm and caring conditions will meet needs for relatedness
structured and predictable conditions will meet needs for competence
and conditions that are supportive of genuine preferences meet needs for
autonomy These three contextual conditions offer a useful framework
for organizing existing research on caseworker practices

and authentic self Caseworkers working to create these conditions
demonstrate their belief that the youth has the right to and is capable of

preferences include encouraging the youth to speak for themselves or

for the youth to speak insisting their opinions are thoroughly consid

Study goals
Through an SDT lens engaging youth in family meetings is a process
of centering youth s needs and creating conditions that meet them As
evidenced in the previous section caseworker practices that create
conditions that meet SDT s three basic needs are already reflected in the
literature Indeed
suggested that the most effective
Cashmore
ways to ensure young people are engaged in decisions that affect their
lives are for them to be able to talk with someone they trust related
ness to be informed about what is happening competence and to
have the opportunity and choice to say what it is they want autonomy
The goal of this study was to use SDT to analyze youth s experiences
with family meetings to identify the conditions that met their three basic
needs and to explain why certain practices created conditions that either
supported or undermined youth engagement In doing so we expected
Children and Youth Services Review
to find that some practices functioned differently for youth depending
on the extent to which the conditions met their unique needs Thus SDT
offers both a framework to organize family meeting practices and their
influence on youth engagement and a tool for reflecting on why certain
practices functioned differently for different youth
Methods
This research was part of a larger evaluation of Oregon s Title IV E
Waiver Demonstration known as LIFE The LIFE model combined
ongoing monthly family case planning meetings with a dedicated
trained facilitator referred to as the Family Engagement Facilitator
enhanced relative search techniques i e efforts to identify and include
kith and kin and peer parent mentors to increase parents engagement
in family meetings Child Welfare Partnership LIFE was founded
on four practice values parent driven youth guided strengths
based culturally responsive and trauma informed As part of the
LIFE model the youth guided practice value required that facilitators
made efforts to include youth in all facets of family meetings e g
preparation agenda development scheduling and logistics participa
tion and decision making Given the LIFE model s focus on youth
engagement the evaluation team conducted a sub study to better un
derstand the experiences of youth as their LIFE team worked to include
them in monthly family meetings
Recruitment procedures
Recruitment for the youth engagement sub study took place January
through April Forms and procedures were reviewed and
approved by a university human subjects review board and the child
welfare agency All new LIFE cases during this period were screened for
youth between the ages of and years old If both the facilitator and
the caseworker agreed that the youth was able to meaningfully physi
cally cognitively and emotionally participate in a minute inter
view and to understand what it meant to give consent assent to
participate the youth was invited to participate in the sub study As a
first step the facilitator approached the youth usually shortly after their
first family meeting told them about the study and asked them for
consent to share their contact information with the evaluation team If
the youth agreed the facilitator forwarded the youth s contact infor
mation to a designated evaluation team member n Facilitators
told the youth that agreeing to be contacted by the evaluation team did
not ensure they would be contacted Due to resource constraints the
evaluation team aimed to interview a sample of youth proportional to
caseloads across the three jurisdictions implementing LIFE services
The next step was for an evaluation team member to contact the
youth and invite them to participate in the sub study An evaluation
team member reached out to the youth by phone described the inter
view in more detail and answered their questions if any Youth
years old and older provided their own consent to participate Youth
years old and younger also needed consent from their legal guardian
typically their caseworker prior to an evaluation staff contacting them
Once contacted the evaluation team member asked the youth to assent
to participate If the youth agreed to participate the evaluation team
member scheduled an interview at a time and place that felt comfortable
to the youth
Interview procedures
Ideally interviewers had observed at least one of the family s case
planning meetings before doing the interview so they had some infor
mation about the meetings and the case and had an opportunity to build
rapport with the youth Due to delays in inviting youth to participate in
the evaluation the logistics of scheduling interviews and some youth
choosing not to participate in their family s meetings this did not
happen for approximately of the youth interviewed Most
C J Furrer et al
interviews took place within the first six months of the youth signing
their consent form although some occurred up to months after the
youth consented
Interviews lasted up to an hour but most took to minutes and
all were conducted in English Youth were interviewed at a location of
their choice typically their foster home or the child welfare office and
received a gift card for participating Four members of the evalua
tion team conducted interviews three are authors of this research One
evaluation staff and author conducted most interviews and the
remainder were split across three other staff two authors Interviews
were recorded with permission and transcribed for analysis
Participants
Evaluation staff invited youth to participate in an interview Of
those youth whose families were receiving LIFE services participated
in interviews On two occasions sibling pairs requested that they talk
with the interviewer together In addition six youth were available to
participate in both an initial and a follow up interview As shown in
the evaluation team conducted initial interviews with
Table
youth and six follow up interviews Youth were years old on
average but ages ranged from to missing age for one youth Just
over half the participants identified as male and the remainder
identified as female More than one third of the youth interviewed
identified as African American Black American Indian Native Amer
ican or Latine Hispanic whereas two thirds either identified
as white or their race ethnicity was unknown Most of the youth
lived in communities that met the federal criteria for rural
designation and the remaining resided in urban areas Most youth
completed their first interview within six months of agreeing to be
contacted by an evaluation staff and once interviewed most
had attended two or more of their family meetings
Interview guide
The interview guide was semi structured i e questions were
designed more like prompts to allow for flexibility in exploring topics
raised by youth and responsiveness to individual differences between
youth e g age gender family configuration This method allowed
interviewers to restate questions speak in a developmentally appro
priate manner probe for additional information and check for under
standing Moreover members of the LIFE Youth Advisory Board a
group of youth with lived experience in child welfare convened to
support the evaluation twice met with interviewers to help them

practice their approach e g language rapport building and provide
feedback for improvement
The interview was organized into five broad categories that aligned
with SDT s three basic needs personal goals informational needs voice
and choice their LIFE team and relationships In the personal goals
section the interviewer asked the youth to describe their personal goals
and the extent to which their LIFE team listened to and supported them
in pursuing their goals Questions in the informational needs section
asked whether the youth was getting the information they wanted about
their case from whom and how helpful it was Voice and choice ques
tions explored whether the youth had opportunities to make choices
about their lives if they felt like they had a say and if their LIFE team
listened and responded to them The LIFE team section included ques
tions about how the family meeting team worked to support their
participation and engagement Last the questions about relationships
focused on the youth s feelings of connection comfort and trust with
people on their LIFE team We invited the youth to talk about their ex
periences of LIFE services and with child welfare more generally
including what they found helpful unhelpful and suggestions for
improvement
Data analysis
We utilized thematic analysis Braun Clarke Hayfield Terry
and used AtlasTi qualitative analysis software for data manage
ment coding and analysis The person who conducted most of the in
terviews did an initial review of five transcripts Coding was both
inductive and deductive the five broad categories that organized the
interview guide provided a starting point but the team added themes as
they emerged from the data and an initial coding schema was devel
oped As the evaluation team completed additional interviews dyads
that included the interviewer coded transcripts Dyads first coded the
transcripts independently using the initial coding schema while being
open to the emergence of new themes then they met to check for
agreement identify emergent topics and resolve any differences After
they reached inter rater reliability agreement on all codes the inter
viewer coded the remaining transcripts and brought questions and new
topics to the evaluation team for discussion
The evaluation team met regularly to troubleshoot the process and
we used constant comparison to generate and refine the themes i e
examining themes in relation to each other and to the original interview
data For example the initial five broad categories were personal goals
informational needs choice the LIFE team and relationships As the
coding progressed we added themes pertaining to well being youth
voice and LIFE team responsiveness and the meaning of other themes
evolved from their original definitions The process was iterative and
multiple rounds of revisions occurred before the team finalized the
themes

follow through on requests for

Coercive or dismissive conditions
LIFE team members ignored

LIFE team members made

without their input
Youth invited to participate in an
adult focused family meeting
that didn t feel relevant to them
for relatedness and encouraged their meeting participation Taking time
to build a trusting relationship for example by spending time preparing
the youth for their family meeting was an important way in which
adults met a youth s need for relatedness In many cases the presence of
just one trusted individual e g relative caseworker facilitator foster
parent was enough to convince the youth to attend Youth often
mentioned counselors therapists and Court Appointed Special Advo
cates as people they trusted They thought of these people as being on
my side One youth described how coming to know their LIFE team
members helped them communicate more openly during meetings
I just have a group of people that I know personally that I have
known for some time now It is not just a complete group of
strangers that I barely know but I feel comfortable with them so I
don t really mind talking about stuff with them
In another example the facilitator helped a youth feel accepted by
the group which in turn promoted the youth s engagement
We had this one meeting because I did something stupid and
facilitator asked if anyone would want to share anything they did
similar in their teenage years And all of them did It just made me
feel more close to them they opened up to me so I thought I might
as well open up to them too
In contrast sometimes youth did not experience interactions with
their LIFE team as warm and caring A few youth did not feel comfort
able speaking at the meeting because the team made them feel anxious
confused or fearful of saying something that might make things worse
Children and Youth Services Review
This lack of trust in their LIFE team made it more challenging for youth
to participate in meetings Moreover participating in a meeting that
focused on what the youth had done wrong as one youth put it made
them feel like I am just in a meeting about people just criticizing me
Conditions in which a youth felt criticized or rejected undermined their
need for relatedness
Including siblings or other family members helped many youth feel a
sense of connection to the people present and therefore more willing to
participate in meetings One youth chose to go to LIFE meetings because
I take that as a time to see my siblings and when the siblings stopped
going the youth saw no point in attending However including family
members did not universally meet youth s need for connection and
therefore did not always encourage engagement Some youth said they
avoided meetings because they did not want to see their parents or other
relatives or they wanted to avoid conflict between family members For
example one youth explained how the presence of a family member
interfered with their ability to share their placement preferences
When my relative is on the phone during a meeting I can t really
talk want to make my relative happy Whenever I am there she
says I wish you could just come stay with me I don t want to hurt her
feelings but I don t really want to live with her I do want to go stay
with her just for the holidays and stuff
This example highlights how a practice inviting family members to
participate in meetings that promoted warmth and connection for some
youth discouraged engagement for others because it did not create
conditions that met their need for relatedness
Structured predictable conditions
Family meeting practices that created structure and predictability
such as having regular meetings sharing information transparency and
preparing youth for meetings helped meet youth s needs for compe
tence and encouraged their participation For some youth having reg
ular meetings helped them know what was going on with their family s
case Access to information according to SDT can meet a youth s need
for competence and therefore encourage their participation in their
family meeting One youth described it
I want to be there because I am the child that is in foster care and I
want to know what s going on instead of just being outside of the
box and not knowing what is going on I want to be inside of the box
and know
In addition to hearing more about what was going on with their
family s case regular meetings provided some youth with an opportu
nity to ask questions of their LIFE team One youth explained how
meetings were an opportunity for them to fill in missing information and
to discuss certain topics They go over every little bit of the case and if
they missed something then you can tell them and ask them if they can
talk about it and most likely they will
Regular meetings were also a way for youth to have transparent
conversations and develop a shared understanding of key issues with
their team Illustrating this point a youth described their experience
with meetings
It gets you on a plan makes you more aware of what s happening
gets everyone together so they are in the room discussing stuff It just
feels better to have everyone at once instead of going individually to
talk to people Everyone gets the picture and the idea all at once
Youth did not uniformly experience information sharing and trans
parent conversations as creating structured and predictable conditions
and therefore did not meet their needs for competence and encourage
participation in family meetings For example some youth did not want
to hear about the bad stuff going on in their family because it led to a
loss of hope and feelings of apathy and helplessness especially if the
youth had a long history in child welfare One youth said I don t really
C J Furrer et al
like to go to the meetings It is just that I don t really like talking about
some of the stuff that is going on Furthermore not all youth were able
to get their questions answered during meetings One youth said that
their caseworker doesn t know sometimes so it is kind of difficult
getting answers Together these findings underscore the importance of
learning about a youth s needs before enacting a practice
Meeting preparation practices often created structured and predict
able conditions by giving youth advance information about the agenda
and who would attend and by providing opportunities for them to ask
questions request information and express needs These conditions
according to SDT can support a youth s need for competence and
encourage engagement One youth described how their facilitator met
with them before their first meeting and explained what was going to
be talked about who all was going to be there and anybody that I
wanted to be there to support me
In contrast some youth had negative experiences during meetings
because they were not prepared by their facilitator or the facilitator did
not follow through on what had been discussed during preparation
Youth who were not prepared sometimes experienced their LIFE team as
demanding information and explanations they weren t prepared to
provide These more chaotic conditions did not meet the youth s need
for competence and made them feel pressure to share more information
than they wanted One youth explained When we talked about me
running away I felt a lot like people did get really needy They needed
to just know everything about why when I don t know
Conditions that support genuine preferences
One of the LIFE model s underlying values was youth guided and
meetings were designed to encourage youth participation and involve
ment in decision making Having a voice and opportunities to make
choices being listened to getting explanations for why decisions were
made and participating in meetings that feel relevant are practices that
can create conditions supportive of youth s genuine preferences which
meet their need for autonomy and encourage engagement Some youth
described how their LIFE team listened to them responded to their
needs and acted upon their requests One youth said they actually
listen especially when we are all in the meetings So actually hearing
what we have to say they can put it into action Another youth
described how their LIFE team was responsive to their needs It is nice
to get with everybody especially when I need something Everyone is
there and I can tell them all straight up what I need so they all work on it
That is pretty helpful
Including youth in decision making about permanency options
especially if the plan shifted away from reunification felt supportive for
many youth For example some LIFE teams spent time exploring per
manent placement options allowing youth to have a say about their
future One youth described that the agency let them choose where they
wanted to live
we can stay if we want to with relative I think she is trying to
get DHS out of it with us plus we really don t want to go back with
our parent yet or at all if that I wanted to stay here and my
parent finally gave custody to my relative for us so we can go
wherever
It was important for youth to feel like their family meetings were
relevant to them and that they had some say about the content Some
youth said their facilitators offered them choices about what would be
discussed For example a youth described how before the meetings
facilitator will call me and ask me what we can talk about and what we
can t talk about In contrast some youth described meetings as too
parent focused and said that they felt tedious repetitive uninforma
tive and pointless One youth described their family meetings as
parent centered which discouraged their participation
Children and Youth Services Review
So I don t go anymore because the meetings were very parent
centered and on top of that it was the same thing every time It
was all about Mom and it was super irritating I am being dragged out
of school where I want to be We would go and it would be Mom
Mom Mom now let s talk about the kids for the last min I
was like I don t care about what she s doing I thought it was going
to center around us and how we were feeling and what we need It is
more revolving around my mom
Youth also described practices that created conditions that made
them feel coerced or disregarded thereby thwarting their need for au
tonomy and undermining their engagement in family meetings For
example some youth noted that their LIFE team was unresponsive or
even went against their wishes others felt the team was judgmental or
critical Another youth described a lack of follow through I just feel
when I ask to know something people say they are going to find out but
they don t really do it that much Youth also described being inter
rupted when they spoke and others felt a lack of support for goals
choices and desires One youth said
All the meetings nobody ever listened to me on any of my opinions
on things They would ask how I felt about certain things that
happened in the case and I said I don t really like it but they would
do it anyway
Some youth said that their LIFE teams disregarded their input ideas
and preferences As one youth put it Just because I m a kid doesn t
mean I don t know what I am talking about I do know what I m talking
about I have been through enough to know what I m talking about
Beyond feeling disregarded by their team some youth felt that the child
welfare system more generally discounts the notion that youth know
what is best for them One youth asserted that they knew what was best
for them in terms of a permanent placement
I knew what was best for me and I knew it was not going to city
and being put in some other random foster care with some people I
had no idea who they were I don t do very well with strangers
Yet another youth pointed to the power differential that youth
experience in foster care
don t think that they think that anybody that is not an adult has
a very good opinion on what they need in life because they are adults
and they have been trained in this kind of thing so obviously they
know best
These results suggest that some practices created conditions that
youth experienced as coercive and dismissive which failed to meet their
needs for autonomy and undermined their engagement in family
meetings
Discussion
This research brought SDT s motivational lens to the process of
engaging youth in child welfare family case planning meetings It also
centered youth s experience of family meeting practices and how they
functioned differently in creating conditions that supported their
engagement depending on the extent to which their needs for related
ness competence and autonomy were met Findings suggest that SDT is
consistent with other literature on youth involvement in family decision
and adds value by offering an orga

portive of genuine preferences can meet youth s basic psychological
needs and encourage their engagement in family meetings
Three conditions that promote engagement
A key finding was that youth were more engaged in their family
C J Furrer et al
meetings when they experienced warm and caring conditions Indeed
SDT suggests that warm and caring relationships support the funda
mental need for relatedness which in turn encourages engagement in
that context This finding is consistent with previous research that points
to the importance of having trusted and caring adults who are seen as
allies
Augsberger Kennan et al van Bijleveld et al
It was found that having someone who knew and could advocate for the
youth helped them feel more willing to participate in meetings and
openly share their thoughts Spending time getting to know LIFE team
members both through regular family meetings and outside of meet
ings helped to build warm and caring relationships
In contrast when youth did not have a relationship or connection
with their LIFE team members or if they experienced indifference or
rejection during their family meetings their need for relatedness was
not met which undermined their engagement This finding extends the
current literature by suggesting that there are multiple pathways to a
youth s experience of warmth and care and that a strategy that is sup
portive for one youth may undermine another youth s experience One
example is involving family members For some youth having family
members participate in family meetings created warm and caring con
ditions which met their need for relatedness For other youth having
family members participate led to conflict which undermined their need
to connect and therefore their willingness to engage As such the sub
jective experience of needs satisfaction rather than a specific practice
predicts engagement
Ryan Deci
As a child welfare practice LIFE meetings offered regular opportu
nities to gather a team of people to share information in a clear and
transparent way and develop a common understanding of goals and
plans Meeting preparation and facilitation practices that created
structured and predictable conditions included having the informa
tion needed to plan act and ultimately find permanent placements for
youth Indeed many youth participants experienced their need for
competence being met through meeting preparation and participating in
regular family meetings see also

From a youth empowerment perspective including youth in their
family meetings counters a common narrative in child welfare about
protecting youth from information about their family that they are too
young to understand what is happening and that certain topics e g
legal or policy issues may not be relevant or appropriate for youth to
hear e g
Dillon et al Toros van Bijleveld et al
Beyond including youth findings from the current study suggest that
protecting youth from or withholding information at least for the older
youth interviewed created conditions that thwarted their need for
competence and undermined their engagement in family meetings
Moreover family meetings that did not offer structured and predictable
conditions e g lack of preparation lack of transparency demands or
pressure from family team members also served to undermine youth s
engagement Taken together these findings imply that the challenge of
engaging youth in family meetings may be less about youth s ability to
be involved than it is about the willingness and capacity for adults to
engage youth

research similarly points to the need for caseworkers to use strategies
that make space to hear a youth s authentic voice thereby addressing
the imbalance of power that youth experience in the child welfare sys
Archard Skivenes Augsberger van Bijleveld et al
tem
The child welfare system which encourages adults to quickly make
decisions for youth makes it challenging for caseworkers to practice in
ways that support youth s need for autonomy Indeed youth inter
viewed for this research described experiences when their LIFE teams
ignored their preferences and made decisions on their behalf without
their input or an explanation for the thinking behind the decision
Failing to educate youth about their permanency options consistently
undermined their need for autonomy Despite these challenges results
suggest that facilitators and LIFE teams found ways to support youth s
genuine preferences This is consistent with research underscoring that
even in a mandatory child welfare environment adults can create op
portunities for youth participation and choice and for youth to share
their ideas without fear of manipulation and pressure Caffrey
Browne
Limitations
The power imbalance that youth in foster care experience in the child
welfare system can limit researchers in their ability to fully represent
their voices Incorporating voice through interviews for example does
not automatically empower youth rather systemic issues such as
power differences can shape what youth in foster care say and their
ability to express themselves
McGregor et al Nybell and
affect the research process
Despite the evaluation
Spyrou
team s efforts to establish rapport with youth it is likely that some youth
withheld information or selectively shared what they thought might be
more socially desirable during interviews Moreover a youth s famil
iarity with the interviewer could have influenced what youth shared
although it is challenging to know how it affected any given youth For
example having an interviewer observe their family planning meeting
could have helped build rapport with one youth and it could have
contributed to another youth feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable
during their interview As another example six youth had follow up
interviews and two interviews involved sibling pairs Either of these
situations could have contributed positively or negatively to what
youth felt comfortable talking about during their interview Other fac
tors that could have influenced what a youth shared during their
interview include individual differences between youth e g age
gender culture family composition and the extent of their experience
in the child welfare system
Interviewees were unevenly distributed across the three child wel
fare jurisdictions implementing LIFE Participating youth were years
old and older English speaking and predominantly white living in rural
areas As such our data may not be indicative of youth experiences
particularly Black Indigenous and other Youth of Color and child
welfare practices in other settings Although the evaluation team
worked hard to recruit youth with varying levels of engagement in LIFE
services those who were most disengaged or never participated in
family meetings perhaps due to having more negative experiences with
child welfare are not represented Therefore these findings likely lack
nuance about working to engage youth in instances when there is a need
to repair relationships or if the youth experienced harm resulting from
child welfare agency decisions e g

Using a motivational framework in the context of child welfare
practice
Understanding how to constructively promote engagement is foun
dational for casework SDT explains that youth engagement reflects the
extent of an individual s needs fulfillment and offers various pathways
to facilitate engagement As such the results of this study have impli
cations for child welfare practice as it pertains to youth engagement
Knowing the importance of a youth s subjective experience one key
implication for practice is that caseworkers need to spend time devel
oping relationships with youth to learn about their needs and ways in
which they can strive to meet them e g

tizing relationships in the child welfare system might also require
creating accountability structures for caseworkers e g required face
to face contact and shifts in resource allocations e g lower case
loads reduced administrative burden to allow caseworkers to spend
time doing this type of work Gibson Samuels Pryce
A second key implication for practice is the need for caseworkers to
shift their thinking away from a compliance orientation toward a needs
based approach to understanding youth engagement SDT explains
that a youth whose basic needs are not being met might respond to their
caseworker by refusing to participate in family meetings with ambiv
alence or by avoiding them A caseworker with a compliance orienta
tion might interpret these types of disaffected behaviors as
noncompliance or opposition rather than as a signal of unmet needs
requiring additional support This dynamic is similar to the assertion
that caseworkers who lack trauma informed training might fail to
recognize youth s emotional and behavioral problems as trauma
symptoms e g Conners Burrow et al
A third key implication for practice pertains to the need for case
workers to both value and practice redistributing power with youth as
they navigate the child welfare system Previous research has high
lighted that when youth are empowered i e autonomy is supported to
participate in processes intended to protect them their participation can
promote their well being Vis et al van Bijleveld et al As
we previously noted youth involved in the child welfare system often
experience additional trauma lack of access to needed supports and
services and challenges to their basic right to participate in their fam
ily s case planning Caseworkers who lack the time practice experience
and skills to work with youth may unintentionally reinforce power dy
namics that exist in the child welfare system
Kosher Ben Arieh
et al
On the other hand caseworkers who understand
how to create conditions for youth to authentically engage in protective
processes such as family case planning meetings can also contribute to
youth well being
A final implication is the need for the child welfare system to
support caseworkers as they strive to do youth centered casework For
example high caseloads and the focus on procedural tasks and paper
work can be significant sources of burnout for caseworkers and get in the
way of the relational work that is necessary to promote engagement e
Leake Rienks Obermann Ferguson Seim
Systemic issues such as caseworker turnover and an organiza
tional culture that does not prioritize youth voice are also barriers to
youth engagement work Child Welfare Information Gateway

Conclusion
The child welfare system struggles to promote authentic youth
engagement Trauma lack of power and other disadvantages experi
enced by youth in foster care profoundly constrain their ability to
Children and Youth Services Review
identify and express their needs and wants SDT suggests that engage
ment reflects needs fulfillment and therefore it is crucial that individual
youth s needs are understood Of central importance for youth
engagement was the LIFE team s ability to recognize and authentically
respond to youth and to hold space which requires time relationship
building and redistributing power for youth with very little control
over their lives to discover and articulate what they need Creating
conditions that encourage youth engagement in their family s case
planning meetings requires caseworkers to practice in ways that coun
teract the power imbalance that youth face as well as a commitment to
centering youth experiences and contributing to their overall well being
and development It also requires a child welfare system that creates
supportive conditions for its workforce

Abstract
Background Computerized clinical decision support CDSS digital information systems designed to improve
clinical decision making by providers is a promising tool for improving quality of care This study aims to
understand the uptake of ASMAN application defined as completeness of electronic case sheets the role of CDSS
in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery outcomes
Methods We have conducted secondary analysis of program data government data collected from public
facilities across four districts each in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan The data collected between
August October baseline and the data collected between December March latest was
analysed The data sources included digitized labour room registers case sheets referral and discharge summary
forms observation checklist and complication format Descriptive univariate and multivariate and interrupted time
series regression analyses were conducted
Results The completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period and in facilities with
more than deliveries a month In multivariate logistic regression analysis the introduction of technology
yielded significant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices We have observed reduction in fresh still
births rates and asphyxia but these results were not statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
However our analysis showed that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of
program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased
Conclusions Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care and delivery
outcome Future studies with rigorous study design is required to understand the impact of technology in
improving quality of maternity care

Introduction
Globally it has been proven that effective and quality of
care at the facility level particularly around childbirth
and immediately after the birth can significantly con
tribute to the reduction of maternal deaths stillbirths
and neonatal deaths Over the last decades efforts
in ensuring skilled birth attendance resulted in increased
institutional deliveries this in turn moved higher pro
portion of avoidable maternal and neonatal mortality to
health facilities Therefore improving quality of care
around childbirth and immediately after birth is impera
tive to prevent adverse outcomes for pregnant women
and new borns
In India despite a tremendous increase in rate of insti
tutional deliveries maternal and neonatal deaths did
not show equivalent reduction in the last decade It
was found by few studies that the increase in the rate of
institutional deliveries was not matched with overall im
provement in quality of maternity care Quality of
care is a multi dimensional concept that incudes avail
ability of evidence based guidelines strengthened infra
structure resources enabling environment attitude of
health providers all these in turn result in patients and
providers satisfaction and improved health outcomes
To address these issues the Government of India
GOI launched the quality improvement initiative under
the name Dakshata means adroitness to build pro
vider adherence to key evidence based clinical practices
during intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods
Dakshata uses the World Health Organization s Safe
Childbirth Checklist SCC as a framework for
improving providers competency Although Dakshata
intervention has not been evaluated other quality of
intrapartum care improvement initiatives using SCC in
Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka
demonstrated significant improvement in adherence to
evidence based clinical practices Moreover a study from
Rajasthan showed reduction in perinatal mortality
which fell by However these studies detected
certain clinical practices that either did not improve sig
nificantly initiation of partograph counselling on dan
ger signs or declined over months period use of
SCC administration of oxytocin soon after delivery
Thus it is imperative to identify and test innovative so
lutions for improving quality of care in order to acceler
ate reduction in maternal and neonatal death in India
One such solution is computerized clinical decision sup
port CDSS digital information systems designed to
improve clinical decision making by providers a prom
ising tool for improving quality of care by improving ad
herence to clinical guidelines practitioner s
performance patient outcomes and
quality of clinical documentation thus contributing
to quality improvement and overall efficiency of health
Page of
care delivery While there is significant research on
CDSSs generally but evidence of use of CDSS for mater
nity care is limited In rural health facilities in Burkina
Faso Ghana and Tanzania CDSS was not found to sig
nificantly improve quality of antenatal and delivery care
A study conducted in South Africa showed that
CDSS lead to overall improvement in adherence to clin
ical guidelines but it was not statistically significant
In Nigeria McNabb et al reported that decision support
via mobile phones led to significant improvement in
health counselling technical services quality of health
education and patient satisfaction
ASMAN intervention
In this paper we describe the findings from implementa
tion of ASMAN The Alliance for Saving Mothers and
Newborns a provider focused package of interventions
that leverages technology to reduce maternal and early
neonatal mortality through the adoption of key tech
nologies that improve capacity building and service de
livery efforts focused on the provision of quality care
during childbirth and the first h after delivery
The ASMAN project takes an integrated quality im
provement approach
Competency building through provision of
training for Medical Officers MOs Staff Nurses
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife ANM on clinical skills
and quality of care as per the established labour
room protocols and standards For this purpose the
project adopted GOI approved Dakshata training
package for building the capacity of service
providers Post training follow up and on site men
toring were conducted by the program team to en
sure translation of skills into practice
Introduction of technology intervention to facilitate
timely and correct clinical decision making by pro
viders For this purpose ASMAN an android based
application for electronic recording of intrapartum
and immediate postpartum care integrated with
Clinical Decision Support e partograph knowledge
enhancement and other features was introduced at
project sites The ASMAN application runs on a
tablet stationed in several important areas of the
health facilities including registration triage the
labor room postpartum areas operation theatre
and post operative wards
The ASMAN application had the following
components
Case management Digitized case sheet from
admission until discharge with integrated clinical
rules admission notes e partogram Safe Childbirth
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Checklist delivery notes post delivery monitoring
post natal care discharge slip referral slip events

ASMAN Complication Management Game a case
based game designed to improve management of
intrapartum and immediate postpartum postnatal
complications for developing critical thinking skills
of health workers around safe child delivery
Safe Delivery App which provides evidence based
clinical guidelines on Basic Emergency Obstetric and
Neonatal Care
Remote support center staffed by senior
residents at the medical college for provision of

remote support center have access to all cases
ASMAN program implementation took place across
public facilities in four districts each in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh states of India The key stakeholders of
ASMAN were Governments of Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan This project was piloted between June
to May with support from Reliance Foundation
Tata Trusts MSD for Mothers Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and United States Agency for International
Development USAID Jhpiego was the lead implemen
tation agency The respective state governments were
consulted to select specific intervention districts that
had higher neonatal and maternal mortality rates as
compared to the state average districts without ongoing
intervention for improving quality of intrapartum and
postpartum care Within those districts government
health facilities that had a relatively high case load of
or more deliveries per month and therefore greater need
for intervention were selected
This program implementation offered an opportunity
to evaluate the role of a CDSS in improving quality of
care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum
periods assess its impact on delivery outcomes identifi
cation and referral of key maternal and neonatal compli
cations in selected public facilities
Methodology
Research aims
To our knowledge no studies from India have described
the impact of CDSS on clinical outcomes during the
intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods Along
with the lack of evidence on effect of CDSS in improving
quality of maternity care this gap represents a crucial
Page of
research priority for India with global relevance
Through this analysis we attempt to answer the follow
ing questions
What was the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers
How did the ASMAN application affect adherence
to key clinical practices
What was the trend of maternal pre eclampsia
eclampsia postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal
fresh still births birth asphyxia complications
during the project implementation
What was the trend of identification and referral of
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
postpartum haemorrhage during the project
implementation
Study design and study setting
We have conducted secondary analysis of program data
government data collected from public facilities
across four districts each in two states of Madhya
Pradesh Jabalpur Khargone Ratlam and Vidisha and
Rajasthan Ajmer Bhilwara Kota and Jhalawar This
de identified dataset was provided by the government of
both states The data collected between August Octo
ber was considered as a baseline and the data
collected between December March was
considered as a latest assessment The study was per
formed in accordance with ethical principles outlined in
the World Medical Association W MA Declaration of
Helsinki where privacy and confidentiality of per
sonal information was assured by getting access to de
identified data
Study tools and data collection
The following tools were used to collect data
ASMAN application data has digitized all labour
room registers case sheets referral and discharge
summary forms of Government of India Every
woman who comes to any ASMAN facility for
delivery is registered in the application All forms
are filled by the health providers at the project
facilities in real time Details from patient history
labour room case sheets partograph until
discharge is collected in the ASMAN application
We have used data from ASMAN application to
understand filling ratio at admission delivery
post delivery postnatal care PNC and discharge
Data of all those women who had delivered at
ASMAN facilities and their newborns between
November and March in Rajasthan
and Madhya Pradesh states are used for this ana
lysis Till March data of women
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
who delivered and newborns were en
tered in ASMAN application
The observation checklist was developed based on
WHO SCC and was approved by GOI as part of
monitoring activities under Dakshata program
This checklist was designed to measure adherence
to essential practices around childbirth These
practices were divided by pause points practices
that are necessary to perform on admission just
before pushing or before caesarean soon after
birth h and before discharge This tool was used
to explore adherence to practices at the baseline and
latest assessment periods The program officers
with medical background collected this information
the observation assessment on average took h
Complication format Maternal and New Born
Complications Identification and Referral
Monitoring System Since there is no formal
mechanism in the government systems to monitor
childbirth and new born related complication and
management complication format was introduced
by ASMAN program team with the support from
the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
The complication reporting format captured data on
key maternal and newborn health indicators from
the labour room postpartum ward Sick Newborn
Care Unit SNCU admissions and discharge
department of the facility This format captured data
on total deliveries type of deliveries fresh stillbirths
preterm births maternal and neonatal death
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
sepsis postpartum haemorrhage sepsis neonatal
complications neonatal asphyxia and sepsis refer
in and refer out data for maternal and neonatal
complications One nodal person preferably a
labour room staff was selected from each
intervention facility to act as the key contact person
for this initiative and was validated regularly by
ASMAN program team This tool was used to
explore effect of ASMAN application on delivery
outcomes
Data analysis
To describe uptake of ASMAN application we com
puted the filling rates of key data fields of the applica
tion and analysed the differences by pause points level
of health facility and average annual delivery load at the
health facilities
To analyze the change in adherence to evidence based
practices after roll out of the intervention we combined
the baseline assessment and last periodic assessment
data sets For overall univariate analysis of adherence to
key clinical practices before and after comparison we
computed means for before and latest intervention
Page of
periods and compared them using chi square test For
adherence to evidence based practices we also per
formed multivariable logistic regression analysis for each
practice while adjusting for level of facility average de
livery load at the facility and availability of resources re
quired for each key practice
To analyze trends in maternal and neonatal complica
tions and referrals we utilized the monthly complication
format data which was shared by all ASMAN interven
tion facilities As the intervention was rolled out in a
staggered manner at different time points across project
health facilities we categorized the complication data of
each facility into two time periods corresponding to be
fore and after intervention roll out
Within each time period we further grouped monthly
data into quarterly data months data such that each
quarter represented a time interval relative to the inter
vention roll out For example Q and Q denoted
the periods corresponding to months before and
months after intervention rollout respectively The
month of intervention roll out together with subsequent
months were denoted as QO or quarter O or the time
interval corresponding to intervention roll out Data of
corresponding quarters was combined for all facilities
and this dataset was used for generating simple time
series plots line bar for analysing the trends before and
after intervention roll out
Single group interrupted time series regression analysis
was performed on two dependent variables fresh still
birth rate and incidence of neonatal asphyxia We
have conducted interrupted time series analysis for these
two outcomes as these were primary outcomes of the
intervention Monthly data was utilized for carrying out
this analysis yielding data for time points before and
after intervention roll out respectively M to M
before roll out and M to M after roll out Coef
ficients or parameters which represented a shift in the
level intercept of the dependent variable and a shift in
the rate of change slope of dependent variable after
intervention were computed along with confidence
intervals Newey west standard errors were utilized to
account for autocorrelation
For all statistical tests of significance p value
was considered significant We used Statistics package
for the Social Sciences SPSS version Stata version
and Microsoft Excel for data analysis

Discussion
Our study described the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers the role of ASMAN appli
cation in improving adherence to key clinical practices
delivery outcomes and maternal complications We have
observed that introducing ASMAN application resulted
in statistically significant improvements in adherence to
key clinical practices However overall completeness of
case sheets in ASMAN application was low across all
levels of facilities We have observed reduction in fresh

still birth rates and asphyxia but these results were not
statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
On the other hand our analysis showed that identifica
tion of maternal complications has increased over the
period of program implementation and at the same time
referral outs decreased
Uptake of ASMAN application
We have included completeness of case sheets in appli
cation as a measure of data quality as it is a commonly
assessed dimension of data quality mentioned in a re
view Although using medical records has been
criticized for measuring quality of record keeping prac
tices instead of quality of care it was argued that patient
case records should be part of quality of care assessment
because individual case records are essential not only for
case management and peer review but also for assessing
the impact of health interventions Additionally it
was noted that clinical record keeping enables continuity
of care and improves communication between different
health providers
Fig Trend of neonata
Our results indicated that the filling ratio during the
post partum period was low across all type of facilities
The poor clinical documentation was reported in a re
view of obstetric records conducted in India with
the extent of documentation varying between as
sessment of mother s condition at the discharge and
admission date Similarly a multicenter retro
spective review of clinical records of cesarean delivery in
five low income countries identified poor quality record
keeping with missing information on key events man
agement of complications and delivery outcomes
Furthermore we have found that the filling ratio across
all pause points was low at the district hospital level and
high delivery load facilities In our qualitative study
health care providers mentioned that staff shortage pa
tient urgency high caseloads prevented staff to complete
all fields in the application According to a study
conducted by Chaturvedi and colleagues Madhya
Pradesh state of India documentation was better at dis
trict hospitals due to higher qualification of the staff in
those facilities and availability of forms at the district
hospitals Although the present study did not conduct

more it was noted by the same study that the data
captured electronically was easily available to providers
compare to paper based records Understanding the rea
sons for the low filling ratios at the PNC period would
require further research The low filling ratio at facilities
with delivery load more than could be explained by
bigger client provider ratio could be reasons as per an
ecdotal experience
Adherence to key clinical practices
Our study revealed that quality of care across all pause
points improved during the implementation of ASMAN
application Furthermore labor room staff in the
qualitative study mentioned that ASMAN application
improved their ability to take a complete history and
physical exam identify high risk patients manage cases
confidently facilitate provider communication improve
reporting processes and ensure continuity of care for re
ferral patients In our study we have observed that
examinations around identification and management of
complications initiation of partograph identification of
post partum haemorrhage increased significantly These
results indicate that ASMAN application has the poten
tial to improve quality of care provided around the
childbirth These are very encouraging results as timely
identification of complications is crucial because over a
third of maternal deaths a significant proportion of
pregnancy related life threatening conditions approxi
mately half of all stillbirths and a quarter of neonatal
deaths are attributed to complications that occur during
labour childbirth or the immediate postpartum period
Our findings are in line with the results of three
systematic reviews on the role of CDSS use on providers
adherence to clinical practices According to

Garg and colleagues better performance of pro
viders was observed in studies where users were auto
matically prompted to use the systems compared with
studies in which users were required to actively initi
ate the system Additionally the same review ob
served better performance in studies in which the
trial authors also developed the CDSS software
Moreover a synthesis of high quality systematic re
views showed that the positive effect of CDSS
depends on the services which it was used CDSS
positively impacted providers performance in studies
on drugs ordering and preventive care measures
Kawamoto et al identified four features strongly
associated with a decision support system s ability to
improve clinical practice a decision support pro
vided automatically as part of clinician workflow b
decision support delivered at the time and location of
decision making c actionable recommendations pro
vided and d computer based Additionally CDSS
should also provide periodic performance feedback
request documentation of the reason for not following
system recommendations and share decision support
results with patients
While there are studies on benefits of CDSS in general
there is very limited research on benefits of CDCC in
maternity care Duysburgh et al did not find a sig
nificant improvement in quality of antenatal and delivery
care with the use of CDSS assessed in Burkina Faso
Ghana and Tanzania They have concluded that history
taking counselling health education laboratory investi
gations and examination and monitoring of mothers
and newborns during childbirth were not performed ac
cording to the standards A study conducted in South
Africa for improving compliance of health care workers
with antenatal care guidelines found overall improve
ment but it was not statistically significant
McNabb et al reports significant improvement in health
counselling technical services quality of health educa
tion and patient satisfaction as a result of a mobile
phone decision support during antenatal care in Nigeria
Furthermore studies conducted in India on the role of
CDSS in the management of cardiovascular diseases
and hypertension demonstrated positive role of
CDSS in improving care adherence to guidelines coun
selling and follow up with patients that resulted in blood
pressure reduction
Delivery outcomes and maternal complications
Improved practices around childbirth have a potential to
prevent birth asphyxia and complications due to prema
turity which are some of the main causes of fresh still
births and early neonatal deaths Our results
revealed that there was a significant decrease in fresh
Page of
still birth and asphyxia however this decrease wasn t sta
tistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
These results are in line with the global evidence on the
lack of evidence of potential impact of CDSS on patient
outcomes Thus according to the sys
tematic review majority of the studies assessed patient
outcomes often without adequate statistical power to de
tect clinically important differences Jaspers and col
leagues found only few studies on impact of CDSS on
patient outcomes though many of these have been too
small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinic
ally important effect Furthermore a systematic re
view and meta analysis found that CDSS linked to
electronic health records did not detect statistically sig
nificant reduction in morbidity and mortality
The lack of statistically significant improvement in de
livery outcomes could be attributed to the small sample
size and short follow up periods which is not long
enough to assess the impact of CDSS on patient out
comes
During the course of the program implementation
we have observed that identification of pre eclampsia
is increased while referrals for the same conditions
decreased This change could be attributed to the
improved assessment at the time of admission
Moreover we have observed the same trend in iden
tification and referral of postpartum hemorrhage that
could be explained by increased administration of
oxytocin within min of delivery
Strengths and limitations
The results of our study contributes to the dearth of lit
erature on the role of CDSS in maternity care From the
onset of the program our team trained and worked
closely with the focal point in each facility to ensure
quality of data and timely reporting Furthermore as a
part of program implementation all providers were
trained in distinguishing and reporting fresh still births
Additionally data reported from facilities were regularly
validated by our team The availability of data before
and during the program implementation allowed us to
estimate the role of CDSS in improving quality of intra
partum care and delivery outcomes Our study has few
limitations Firstly it is possible that providers carried
out the patient management according to the standards
but didn t record it in application Secondly our assess
ment involved direct observation of provider practices
as a result potential Hawthorne effect would have hap
pened To minimize Hawthorne effect we trained our
project officers using standard observation checklist and
standard operating procedures Lastly due to utilization
of program data in our analysis establishing causal claim
is limited
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Conclusion
To our knowledge this is the first study that provides
and evidence on the role of technology to improve the
quality of intrapartum care and delivery outcomes in
India However the results of this study could be gener
alized to another country with similar settings Our
study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality
of intrapartum care and delivery outcome Future studies
with rigorous study design are required to understand
the impact of technology in improving quality of mater
nity care These studies could provide evidence on redu
cing the burden of maternal and neonatal death
attributable to inadequate quality of care in India and
globally

A Review of Pregnancy in Women Over Years of Age

University of Kuopio Department of Nursing Science P O Box Kuopio Finland
Open Access
Abstract The objective of the present paper is to review how pregnant women over years have been described in
previous research and to review the risks associated with pregnancy in those of advanced maternal age Computerized
searches of the Cinahl PubMed Medic and Cochrane Library databases were undertaken Research articles in scientific
journals relevant to the objective and published in English between and were included Data were extracted
based on the aims sample authors year and results
Results Advanced maternal age is associated with certain pregnancy related risks Being at risk causes anxiety and
concern which older pregnant women try to ease by being as well informed as possible This may be overwhelming to
some women due to the large amount of information available
Conclusions It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the different feelings and experiences of older
pregnant women in order to meet their individual needs within the maternity services
Keywords Maternal age risk advanced maternal age
INTRODUCTION
In developed countries such as Finland and Sweden
childbearing later in life is a phenomenon which has become
increasingly evident in the last three decades For
example in Finland in of primigravida women
were over years old By this had increased to
The situation is closely comparable with Sweden where
in of primigravidas were years of age or older
In of all women giving birth in Finland
were over years old whereas the figure in was
The risks related to pregnancy in those over years old
especially primiparity can be understood from two
perspectives first the actual medical risks and second the
acceptability of the risks as defined through social discourse
among different groups within society Medical risks are
related to an ageing reproductive system and an ageing body
whereas social discourse prescribes the way in which older
pregnant women are regarded as mothers and when it is
considered that women should have children It has
been said that pregnant women and healthcare providers
understand the risks differently pregnant women evaluate
the risks subjectively through their own experiences
whereas healthcare providers assess the risks in an
apparently more objective way
Advanced maternal age AMA is seen by patients and
healthcare professionals to be correlated with poorer
outcomes to pregnancies This is largely because of the
higher incidence of chronic medical conditions among older
women Women of AMA are often treated as if they are in
need of the level of care necessary for any high risk

pregnancy and they are treated differently even if there is no
scientific basis for different treatment and there are no
medical problems evident However pre existing and
pregnancy related morbidity combined with high maternal
expectations does put these women in greater need of
intervention during pregnancy and birth Despite the
perceptions of increased risks related to AMA it has been
suggested that the risks are manageable and positive
outcomes can be expected
In recent years several reviews concerning pregnant
women aged years or older have been conducted which
have focused on the risks associated with AMA the
relationship between AMA and pregnancy outcomes
the evidence of risks faced by women of AMA and the
association between maternal age and still birth Fewer
studies have focused on women s own experiences of later
childbearing and age related pregnancy risks The purpose of
the present review article is to provide an overview of how
previous research has described pregnant women aged over
and what the pregnancy risks related to AMA are
DATA AND METHODS
Research articles for this review were retrieved from
searches of the Cinahl PubMed Medic and Cochrane
Library databases Keywords used in the search were
Maternal age and over and advanced maternal age
The assistance of an information specialist librarian was used
to confirm the adequacy of keywords used in the search
terms The search was limited to the period between
and in order to focus on the most recent information
available We searched for original research articles
reporting studies conducted using qualitative or quantitative
methods and which had been published in English Other
review articles were omitted from the present review
Studies focusing on both primi and multiparous women
were included
Bentham Open
The Open Nursing Journal Volume
Searching Cinahl with the keywords maternal age
and over returned references searching PubMed with
maternal age over returned and with advanced
maternal age references Searching the Medic and
Cochrane Library databases provided no relevant references
Following retrieval the first phase of the review process
involved reading through the titles of all references in
order to delete references from the selection based on the
exclusion criteria listed below In the second phase abstracts
of all the remaining non excluded references were read
through
The exclusion criteria were the topic was irrelevant to
the objective of this study there was no abstract available
the study was focused on only a particular medical
problem related to pregnancy in older women for example

developmental disorder with the foetus the study referred
to postpartum and maternity issues and the full research
article was unobtainable with reasonable effort
In the third phase when the final selection of articles had
been made all available full text versions of the selected
articles were read through A further manual search of cited
references in the selected research articles was also made
using the same exclusion criteria mentioned above This
provided two more articles for inclusion in the present
review PubMed produced five and Cinahl eight relevant
research articles so that finally a further articles were
included in the analysis Table
Qualitative studies were examined using content analysis
This inductive analysis revealed certain themes and subjects
within the selected articles which addressed the research
questions and which could finally be grouped together
thematically Quantitative studies which were mainly
focused on the medical risks associated with AMA and
which had been analysed statistically were analysed in the
present review by collating common subject areas and
grouping them together thematically with the articles from
the papers describing qualitative studies
RESULTS
Women s Knowledge of Pregnancy related Risks and
their Decisions concerning the Timing of Childbearing
The knowledgability of older pregnant women
concerning pregnancy related issues has not been the focus
of many studies we found only three research articles that
described women s knowledge of pregnancy risks related to
delayed childbearing and their knowledge base for making
decisions about the timing of motherhood These
studies revealed that women were well aware of the age
related decline in fertility but they relied on the
expectation of the assistance of reproductive technology
being available if needed Some researchers found
that women recognized there to be a higher likelihood of an
older mother giving birth to a baby with Down s syndrome
and of there being a greater risk of miscarriage and
having high blood pressure However the probabilities
of needing to deliver by Caesarean section having a
premature or low birth weight baby stillbirth or of
Lampinen et al
multiple births were not as well identified It has
been suggested that neither women nor men fully recognize
the link between increased maternal age and the
developmental and health related risks of low birth weight or
pre term infants Moreover both men and women lack
knowledge concerning conception pregnancy complications
and infant outcomes as related to delayed childbearing
In general both men and women should be much better
informed about the complications and declining fertility
associated with a first pregnancy at an AMA
Few studies discussed the timing of childbearing
Maheswhari et al found that sub fertile women
thought and years more acceptable as an age at which
to become a first time mother than pregnant women did
Another study revealed that while most women were
satisfied with their decisions of postponing childbearing
women of years of age and older would in retrospect
have started having children earlier in life A stable
relationship education and developing a career before
having a family influenced women s decisions concerning
the timing of childbearing Financial security and their
partner s suitability to be a parent were also important
factors In addition women described having a
feeling of a biological clock ticking away which affected
their decisions concerning the timing of motherhood
Information Gathering and Women s Preparation for
Pregnancy
Issues related to a woman s preparation for pregnancy
were described in five studies These
indicated that being well prepared for pregnancy seemed to
be a characteristic more typical of older pregnant women
Being considered at risk causes women anxiety which
they try to ease by preparing themselves for pregnancy and
seeking information Carolan showed that women
aged over years approached pregnancy as a project which
should be preceded by a stage of careful planning These
women described their main health concerns as the
likelihood of foetal genetic problems or maternal
complications during pregnancy e g gestational diabetes
postpartum depression multiple births or miscarriage
Prior to conception older women also prepared
themselves for pregnancy both mentally and physically
Such preparation often meant losing weight going on diets
and taking exercise Some women visited specialist
doctors to discuss existing health issues such as blood
pressure Choosing hospitals and birth care options was
another way in which women prepared for pregnancy and
being aware of the increased risks associated with their age
they especially valued the availability of emergency services
at hospitals Having become pregnant women adopted a
different range of health promoting activities in response to
their concerns and needs in relation to their pregnancy
These activities included following a healthy lifestyle and
taking special care of their nutritional status
Women also approached pregnancy by searching for
information from multiple sources which they sometimes
found offered contradictory advice Women
searched for information from the internet journal articles
childbirth educators and hospital telephone information

Levels of amniocentesis ceasarean section assisted

among older women Maternity service use also
increases significantly with age
Independence a stable relationship and declining
fertility influenced women s decisions about timing of
motherhood
Four risk related themes realizing the status at risk
hoping for reassurance dealing with uncertainty and
getting through it negotiating risk
Percentage of mothers approached childbearing as a
major project in their lives Project progressed through
clearly defined stages of information gathering
planning and preparing and finishing up tasks prior to
the birth
Mothers were found to have access to large volumes of
health information Midwives and maternal and child
health nurses revealed a tendency to provide older first
time mothers with considerable health information of a
medical orientation understanding that this is what the
women required
Increasing age was significantly associated with
miscarriage chromosomal abnormalities congenital
anomalies gestational diabetes placenta previa and c
section
Perinatal death intrauterine fetal death and neonatal
death increased with age Also intercurrent illnesses
and pregnancy complications increase with increasing
age
Pregnant women aged or older are at increased risk
of complications in pregnancy compared with younger
women
Older women were more likely to have hypertension
diabetes mellitus placental abruption or placenta
revia but they were less likely to be nulliparous and to
smoke Also preterm birth and small for gestational age
rates were higher
Despite awareness of the impact
of age on fertility of the subfertile group expected
IVF to overcome the effects of age compared with
of the pregnant population Knowledge about age
related obstetric risks such as trisomy was similar
in both groups vs Almost all participants
believed that women should be informed about
the implications of delaying childbearing at an early
age
This study emphasises the increased maternal and fetal
risks for pregnancies at these extreme age groups in a
retrospective way
Older primigravidas took more time in antenatal
consultations No significant difference was found
between the groups of women although a small
number in both groups were very anxious

Expectations and experiences vary by maternal age The
youngest women had the most negative expectations of the
upcoming birth but their experience of childbirth did not differ

not have negative feelings about the upcoming birth but
experienced childbirth overall as more difficult
networks Carolan b found that career
oriented educated women preferred information written for
a medical and midwifery audience rather than popular
reading material such as magazine articles Carolan
also found that pregnant women over years old
sometimes felt they had too much information concerning
age related pregnancy risk and foetal disorders which made
them anxious and made it difficult for them to focus on
positive outcomes However these women still wanted to be
as fully informed as possible
In one study Carolan found that healthcare
providers gave a lot of medically oriented information to
pregnant women aged over presuming that this was what
these older educated women needed and wanted However the
recipients found such information to be more overwhelming
than empowering and midwives and maternal and child health
nurses found it quite challenging to provide the right level and
type of advice to these women However although these
women felt themselves to be over informed which increased
their concerns they still thought that information about the
risks and benefits of delayed childbearing should be provided
and that the ideal time would have been at an age when they
were in their early
Manifestation of Risks and Women s Experiences of
Risks Pregnancy and Care
It has been shown that AMA increases pregnancy related
risks and the probability of obstetric complications Six
studies described the risks complications and obstetric
outcomes related to pregnancy in women aged over years
Compared to younger women the types of complications
that women over years are at increased risk of during
pregnancy include gestational diabetes placenta praevia
pre eclampsia miscarriage and pregnancy
induced hypertension as well as Caesarean sections
Induction of labour augmentation with
primiparae and assisted deliveries are also associated with
women of AMA Perinatal mortality perinatal and
neonatal death and intra uterine foetal death also increase
with increasing age Older women are also more likely
to have been diagnosed with conditions such as hypertensive
disorders diabetes mellitus and other chronic diseases for
which they are already taking medication These
chronic medical conditions may further complicate their
pregnancies
However some risks should be interpreted with caution
Bell et al found that age related increased
intervention rates were
independent of maternal
complications during pregnancy complications during
labour a history of infertility and other confounding factors
Age alone was not responsible for gestational hypertensive
disorders although chronic hypertension was found to be
more common among women of advanced maternal age
Adverse outcome rates were in fact higher among older
women even when there were no complications in their
pregnancies Interestingly the increased occurrence of
pre existing diagnoses or complications among older women
was not related to the increased risk of an adverse perinatal
outcome Despite the fact that increased risk with
increasing age has been clearly demonstrated studies
suggest that overall pregnancy outcomes are favourable
because perinatal death is such a rare event even with AMA
mothers
Being at risk is not always obvious to pregnant AMA
women Carolan and Nelson showed that AMA
women who were in good health during pregnancy were
surprised to learn that they were in fact classified in a high
risk category due to their age As already stated knowing
themselves to be in a high risk group can have a negative
impact on older pregnant women causing them additional
concern and leading them to seek higher levels of health
monitoring during pregnancy Zasloff et al found
that women over years were more worried about the baby
compared with younger women However knowing
themselves to be at risk does not necessarily prevent the
natural positive feelings of pregnancy from being
experienced although older women do seem to need to be
reassured more often that everything is well Pregnant
women years of age or older often wanted additional
ultrasonic scans and genetic testing to be assured that
nothing was wrong Robb et al found no
A Review of Pregnancy in Women Over Years of Age
correlation between maternal age and emotional distress in
primigravidas when comparing pregnant women aged and
over to those aged years Feelings during pregnancy
were mainly positive or anxious described using phrases
such as being delighted overjoyed and extremely lucky
or worried about the baby AMA women also
appreciated the support received from healthcare providers
during the genetic testing process
Carolan and Nelson found that although AMA
women were generally pleased with the care received they
considered healthcare providers attitudes towards their
concerns to be somewhat insensitive and dismissive Older
pregnant women also expressed a need for more time for
discussion during maternity care visits Robb et al
again highlighted the importance of healthcare providers being
aware how the concept of risk is assimilated by AMA mothers
since the apparent over concern of health care professionals
towards maternal and foetal well being can increase the stress
levels of pregnant women Older pregnant women also benefit
from being given some favourable or positive information
related to delayed childbearing and motherhood as the
reassurance derived from this decreases stress Women over
years did not generally have negative feelings about the
forthcoming birth of their children but they did find childbirth a
more difficult experience compared with younger women
DISCUSSION
In the Western world the average age at which first time
mothers give birth is continually rising Complications and
risks associated with pregnancy among women of AMA have
been addressed in numerous studies from different viewpoints
mostly focusing on the medical risks associated with higher
maternal age The purpose of this review was to profile how
women over years and the associated pregnancy related risks
have been described in previous research
Studies examined in this review have shown an increased
likelihood of certain medical complications among women
of AMA However when exploring the risks associated with
AMA it is important to consider the influence of
confounding variables such as marital status economic
status smoking parity BMI pre existing diagnoses history
of using medications before conception and previous
adverse prenatal outcome
While the experiences and knowledge of the older
pregnant woman are described in the present review the role
of a father and family is not covered Although it was not in
the search terms for this review it appears to be a subject
area that has not been well addressed in the literature thus
how fathers experience later childbearing is not well known
Most studies reviewed here focused on the association
between AMA and its related risks while only a few focused
on the experiences of pregnancy in general
In summary during pregnancy women over years
prepare for pregnancy gather information receive
information from healthcare providers and worry about their
pregnancy and their status of being at risk Nevertheless
these women also experience positive feelings One of the
major difficulties to address is that while these women want
to be as well informed and prepared as possible the
information they receive can cause more anxiety rather than
alleviate their concerns There are therefore
The Open Nursing Journal Volume
challenges for maternity care workers to understand the
importance of a holistic approach which takes into
consideration the individual physical emotional and social
needs of older childbearing women
Included in the present review are studies that were
conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods The
original data varied from responses to small qualitative
interviews to large data sets obtained from birth certificates or
other archived records The majority of the studies reviewed
here were carried out in the USA Canada UK and Australia
but interestingly among these the number conducted in nursing
science was relatively small Although the phenomenon of later
childbearing is common in developed countries an analysis of
the experiences of pregnant women in Europe is still needed in
order to determine the most suitable ways in which maternity
care should be structured to meet the individual needs of AMA
women
This review is limited to the small number of relevant
studies that the literature search which focused on advanced
maternal age was able to retrieve Although AMA is
associated with increased pregnancy related risks and other
complications by excluding these and other specific search
terms the search results may have been constrained
However the principal aim was to gather information
specifically on older pregnant women for which purpose the
terms used in the search were relevant and verified by a
specialist librarian The search terms used should have
returned literature that encompassed the specific risk issues
related to AMA but they may not necessarily have done so
As already stated the number of studies included in this
review was quite small This was partly due to the fact that
all studies relating to either postnatal issues or to specific
medical problems associated with pregnancy in older
women were excluded Any literature not published in
English would also have been excluded from the search It
may be fair to criticise the exclusion criteria used for the
present review however the studies that were finally
included formed quite a diverse selection and the overall
breadth of issues covered in them means that the conclusions
that can be drawn from the present review are valuable
relevant and usable
It is important to remember that most women of AMA
give birth at term without experiencing adverse maternal or
prenatal outcomes Furthermore the fact that absolute
rates of prenatal mortality morbidity are low suggests that
the majority of older women do have a desirable outcome to
their pregnancy The level of information provided to an
AMA woman concerning the risks that similar women
might experience during pregnancy and the manner in which
such information is given during maternity care should
depend on her health status her existing knowledge and her
need for information This requires careful judgement by a
sensitive communicative healthcare professional who is
able to develop a good patient provider interaction and who
can allow and make available sufficient time for discussion
Older pregnant women must be made aware of the risks
related to later childbearing in order that they might be able
to make informed decisions about whether or not to become
pregnant but they should also be made aware of the
probability of successfully reach full term and of having a
completely problem free pregnancy and birth
The Open Nursing Journal Volume
CONCLUSION
Pregnant women over years old have issues and
concerns to which healthcare providers must pay attention
when in professional contact with these women In order to
meet the needs of older pregnant women healthcare
providers themselves need more information concerning the
experiences of older women during pregnancy in order to
increase their understanding and knowledge of age related
pregnancy risks Healthcare providers should remember that
pregnancy can evoke a broad range of feelings in women of
advanced maternal age which can vary from happiness to
anxiety
This review illustrates the importance of the nature of
available information and how it is given to older pregnant
women Older pregnant women have a desire for knowledge
and they are active information seekers Information given
by healthcare providers is therefore important for older
pregnant women during their process of becoming mothers
It is especially important that each woman of AMA should
be treated as an individual and not simply as a member of a
certain group Being aware of the diverse experiences of
older pregnant women can help healthcare providers to
understand better the needs of these women Such awareness
can also help health care providers to realize that it is
important to offer AMA women not only risk oriented
information but favourable information concerning later
childbearing as well In order to be a successful healthcare
provider they should consider their own personal and
individual way of approaching older pregnant women as
well as being up to date and well informed of all the risks
related to AMA
More studies involving larger samples are needed in
order to define the actual risks during pregnancy and the age
to which the term advanced maternal age could properly
be used It has been shown that there is an inconsistency in
the literature between the definition of and the risk
assessment of the older pregnant woman In addition
healthcare providers perceptions and experiences of caring
for women of AMA would also be an invaluable resource if
it were to be documented Healthcare providers would then
be able to find out how other members of their profession
have managed the wide range of situations that occur when
in contact with older pregnant women

Abstract Recent upsurge of social working couples low income levels of welfare support for children etc As the country
expanded most of the home by parents entrust their children to kindergarten or preschool child s growth education and has
commissioned As a result shipments of kindergarten children or helping with school bus accidents occur frequently in and
out and also a national problem of low birth rate due to the increase in child or family members including two children
and their children too much attention on the increase due to the obese children that is no drill Thus children in the park in
order to maintain a safe and healthy life safety and growth of children by building management systems with their parents

I Introduction
A Children in govemment health care continues to rise
many govemment policies such as obesity management are
suggested However the management of this series is
entirely parent or the kindergarten nursery school teacher s
duty of care of business due to a unique addition to the
existing restaurant that is more burdened Childhood
obesity related youth years when the prevalence of
obesity in to from in has shown an
increasing phenomenon In addition the relationship
between the park with a large number of children living
disease caused by a large number of children is expected
to spread and also as a kindergarten school bus accidents
is steadily and rapidly School children and the vehicle in

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy HDPs are no longer seen as transitory diseases cured by delivery It accounts for up to
of maternal deaths Information concerning HDPs is less in developing countries like Ghana This study was conducted to
find out the prevalence awareness risk factors control and the birth outcomes of HDPs This was a retrospective cohort
study conducted among pregnant women seeking care in selected health facilities in the Ashanti Region Data on
demographics HDPs and its associated birth outcomes were collected Logistic regression models were used to examine the
association of the independent variables with HDPs The burden of HDPs was among the mothers enrolled with
chronic hypertension superimposed with preeclampsia accounting for chronic hypertension and preeclampsia
whilst gestational hypertension was It was observed that of the mothers had excellent knowledge on
HDPs Oral nifedipine and methyldopa were frequently used for HDP management and it resulted in a significant reduction
in HDP burden from to Factors that influenced the increased risk of HDPs were grand multigravida
AOR CI family history of hypertension AOR CI and the consumption of herbal
preparations AOR CI and alcohol AOR CI during pregnancy HDPs increased the
risk of preterm delivery AOR CI stillbirth AOR CI and undergomg caesarean
section AOR CI amongst mothers during delivery The burden of HDPs is high amongst pregnant
mothers seeking care in selected facilities There is the need for intensified campaign on HDPs in the Ashanti Region of Ghana
Background
Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy HDPs are the leading
cause of maternal mortality It contributes to and
maternal mortality worldwide and in Sub Saharan
Africa SSA respectively Chronic hypertension pre
eclampsia eclampsia gestational hypertension and chronic
hypertension superimposed preeclampsia are the four cate
gories of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy In Ghana
it is estimated that the maternal mortality rate is deaths
per live births This is about times higher
than the UN recommended rate One of commonest cause
of direct maternal death identified was severe preeclampsia
eclampsia which accounted for of all direct maternal
deaths and of all maternal deaths in
Factors such as educational level age higher parity
occupation family of HDPs gravida complications of preg
nancy and others such as healthcare systems and social cul
tural and economic factors are seen to be associated with
HDPs Studies have shown that a woman s knowledge
about her condition can influence early health seeking
behaviour and compliance to treatment which would result
in early diagnosis and prevent pregnancy complication
including death Lack of knowledge on HDPs could lead
to misconceptions which may include interpretation of
warning signs as normal occurrence during pregnancy or
as spiritual attacks Although maternal serum
concentrations have been found to be associated with
early onset preeclampsia the cause of HDPs remains
unclear and treatment remains symptomatic with the pri
mary objective being the safety of the mother Over the
years HDPs have being controlled with regular blood pres
sure monitoring use of approved pharmacotherapeutics
and other nonpharmacological preventive measures
Target of the Sustainable Development Goals SDG
as set by the United Nations is aimed at reducing the mater
nal mortality ratio to per live births by
However the burden of hypertension has been increas
ing over the past few decades in SSA and a large percentage
of the population with hypertension remains untreated inef
fectively treated or even undiagnosed Furthermore
this study is important because much research has studied
the prevalence awareness and control of hypertension
among the general population however there is a need for
studies focused on pregnant women as the effect of HDPs
include risk of harm not only to the mother but also to the
unborn child HDPs are no longer seen as transitory dis
eases cured by delivery but as windows into the woman s
future health that needs integrated care coordinating treat
ment to identify risk factors and correct them This
study is aimed at identifying the prevalence risks awareness
control and the birth outcomes of HDPs among pregnant
women in some selected health facilities in the Ashanti
Region of Ghana
Methods
Study Design and Site This was a retrospective cohort
study which employed a well structured pretested close
response questionnaire to obtain data from pregnant women
who were seeking care at four hospitals in the Ashanti
Region The Ashanti Region is the second most populous
region in Ghana GSS with over hospitals both
private and public hospitals The study sites included the
Ejisu Government Hospital Ejisu Municipal Kwame
Nkrumah University of Science and Technology KNUST
Hospital Oforikrom Municipal Kumasi South Hospital
Asokwa Municipal and the Komfo Anokye Teaching
Hospital KATH Kumasi Metropolis Bantama sub metro
district These facilities were chosen because of their loca

tion in the region and the large coverage of patients they
cater for
Sample and Sampling This study included pregnant
women above the ages of years who had been admitted
for delivery and those who had delivered at the hospital dur
ing the period of the study Pregnant women who were on
admission for other reasons besides delivery were excluded
At a significance level of the Yamane method was
used to determine the sample size The estimated num
ber of live births in the Ashanti Region in was
If the number of live births equals the number of preg
nant women for the year a sample size of pregnant
women would be suffcient Considering nonresponse rate
a minimum of about pregnant women were recruited
From this figure and
mothers were recruited from the Ejisu District
Hospital KNUST Hospital Kumasi South Hospital and
KATH respectively Employing quota sample size for each
facility was determined using the documented average
monthly delivery at each hospital
Consented participants were screened for eligibility Par
ticipants who were eligible for this study were numbered and
randomly sampled using an online number generator Par
ticipants whose numbers were generated were included in
the study
Development and Validation of Questionnaire The
questionnaire was developed after reviewing several litera
tures to ensure that the items capture a meaningful construct
to have causality to the outcome of interest The question
naire was piloted within a selected hospital To assess the
reliability of the construct of composite variables such as
the level of knowledge a Cronbach alpha test was con
ducted For the Cronbach alpha test for level of knowledge
the score was which indicates that the composite vari
able is reliable Information was collected on their socio
demographic characteristics factors influencing their risk
of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy level of awareness
management of the disorders and the birth outcomes
The level of knowledge was assessed as an item com
posite variable For a correct response a code of was
assigned and for a wrong response a code of O was assigned
Therefore a participant can score a maximum of and a
minimum of O Where a participant scores less than and
then the participant has poor level of knowledge scoring
between and was considered satisfactory level of knowl
edge and to was considered good level of knowledge
A participant is considered to have an excellent level of
knowledge on HDPs if the participant scores to
Code of was assigned to participants who had HDPs
and O to participants who did not have evidence of HDPs

Discussion
Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy HDPs have been
established to be a leading cause of maternal deaths
accounting for about to of all maternal deaths
in the country In a study conducted in a teaching hos
pital in Ghana in the burden of HDPs was found
which is about two times the global burden With
a national maternal mortality of in it was esti
mated that up to maternal deaths in Ghana were caused
by hypertensive disorders
The burden of HDPs in this study was and
of the participants had no HDPs which is comparable to a
study by Awuah et al in which the burden of HDPs
was and the proportion of women without HDPs
was Although the sample size was less compared to
this study the prevalence of gestational hypertension and
preeclampsia were high compared to chronic hypertension
in pregnancy Awuah recorded and for preeclamp
sia and gestational hypertension respectively against
and in this study Another study which was conducted
in a tertiary hospital in the Ashanti Region also recorded a
prevalence of and for gestational hypertension

and preeclampsia respectively A systematic review of
HDPs in Ethiopia pooled a national prevalence of with
subgroup analysis by region showing a higher prevalence of
HDPs This confirms the high prevalence of HDPs in
the region and the needs for better strategies for prevention
to improve pregnancy outcomes are required in the mater
nity care centers
The disparity of the disease burden among the various
studies could be attributed to a lack of consensus on the
diagnostic criteria of the various hypertensive disorders
This is because the health facilities in this study all use treat
ment protocols similar to the national standard treatment
guidelines for management of HDPs However the
blood pressure level to start treatment depends on the facil
ity prescriber on duty and other patient related factors
It would be appropriate to address these discrepancies so
that accurate prevalence can be recorded and tackled well
Despite the above explanation Ghana has often recorded
a high burden of HDPs and this should be of national health
concern because it has been a major cause of maternal and
prenatal morbidity and mortality
Knowledge of an individual on a particular health condi
tion influences the health seeking behaviour of individual
Thus knowledge on HDPs has been assessed as efforts
at preventing HDP burden It is evident from this study that
almost half of the women have excellent knowledge of
HDPs This is very encouraging Having more knowledge
would mean that the mother would be informed on the
causes risk factors signs symptoms and possibly treatment
options for HDPs Considering the negative effect of these
disorders on both maternal and neonatal outcomes coupled
with the associated economic cost of management an
increase in knowledge would go a long way to decrease the
burden of the disorders improve treatment compliance
and overall reduce maternal and neonatal morbidities and
mortalities associated with the disorders It is expected that
as the knowledge of an individual increases the risk of con
tracting that disease reduces

FIGURE Proportion of various types of HDPs amongst study
respondents
Oral nifedipine and oral methyldopa at different doses
were the drugs often prescribed This finding is similar to
the findings of Kumar et al where it was observed that both
nifedipine and methyldopa are the most prescribed antihy
pertensives in pregnancy Nifedipine is a calcium chan
nel blocker which is effective at reducing blood pressure
without uteroplacental blood flow nor slowing foetal heart
rate While methyldopa is preferred because it is a cen
trally acting a agonist that decreases sympathetic outflow to
decrease BP it has a very long duration of action and the
best safety profile amongst the antihypertensive drugs used
during pregnancy Currently methyldopa has no associ
ated congenital anomaly The prescribed medications are
accepted for the management of hypertensive disorders in
pregnancy because of their low risk of adverse complications
in pregnancy All the prescribed drugs are in line with the
stated guidelines
The mean blood pressure of pregnant women at week
gestation was mmHg which is considered nor
mal However this average is confounded by several factors
such as the gestational stage and the baseline blood pressure
at the start of the pregnancy At around the fifth week of ges
tation there is an expansion of the blood volume which
causes a drop in the blood pressure of the mother At this
critical stage hypertensive mothers may appear to have a
normal blood pressure This may have accounted for
the normotensive mean blood pressure of mothers at that
gestational age At the point of delivery it was realized that
the mean BP of the mothers was mmHg which
saw a significant increase of the mean diastolic pressure of
the mothers Even though the mean blood pressures of the
mothers were still within the normotensive regions This
increase in the mean diastolic pressure may be normaliza
tion of the BP after the initial drop of the blood pressure
Again from the results obtained it was realized that
there was a significant decrease in the proportion of mothers
who had high blood pressure by Table This
indicates that management of mothers who had high blood
Journal of Pregnancy
pressure at week gestation resulted in a decrease of the
proportion of mothers who had high blood pressure at the
time of delivery It is also worth noting that as part of man
agement some proportion of mothers delivered preterm as
part of efforts to avert adverse birth complications Thus
at time of delivery these mothers would be hypertensive
Hence although there was a drop the proportion of mothers
who were hypertensive at delivery was significantly higher
and of public health concern
The level of education influenced the risk of being hyper
tensive in pregnancy such that mothers who had junior high
school education were less likely to develop HDPs com
pared to the likelihood of mothers without any formal edu
cation developing HDPs This finding is consistent with
the findings of Abalos et al where evidence obtained
established that education was a risk factor for hypertensive
disorders This may be that as an individual that is educated
there is an increased chance of been informed on the risk
factors and prevention of HDPs So that they may take nec
essary measures to prevent the risk of developing HDPs
However there was no statistical significance association
between the odds of mothers who had no formal education
developing HDPs compared to the odds of mothers who
had other levels of education developing HDPs Under the
bivariate analysis mothers with tertiary education were
times more likely to develop HDPs compared to
mothers who had no formal education However after
adjusting for known confounders this association dimin
ished with no statistical significance This indicates that the
observed association maybe an anomaly and as such it is
inconclusive to suggest that education status influences the
risk of HDPs in this study
It was also realized that high number of pregnancies
greatly influenced the risk of HDPs Table Though sev
eral studies such as Sengodan and Sreeprathi have
established that primigravid mothers were at risk of HDPs
the findings from this study corroborate the evidence by
Cho et al that mothers with multiple gestation have
an increased risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy
particularly preeclampsia However it has been established
that up to about of hypertensive disorders do not
resolve after delivery When these hypertensions do
not resolve before a woman gets pregnant again it is consid
ered as chronic hypertension in pregnancy and thus
increases the cumulative burden of hypertensive disorders
amongst mothers with multigravidity
Genetics has been explained to influence the risk of
chronic disease in several populations The evidence of this
study suggests that mothers who have family history of
HDPs were at times increased risk of developing HDPs
compared to women who have no family history of hyper
tensive disorders This is in sync with the systematic review
by Tesfa et al which confirmed that family history of
hypertension increased the risk of hypertensive disorders
in pregnancy by fourfolds Since family members share some
genetic make up and some lifestyle or habits there is an
increased likelihood that they may share similar risk of a
particular disease burden This explains why mothers
with family history of hypertensive disorders are at an

increased risk of HDPs It is therefore recommended that in
diagnosing a mother of HDPs the risk profile should con
sider the history of hypertension in the family This would
help in early diagnosing and management of hypertensive
disorders
The use of complementary and alternative medicine
CAM is predominant in Ghana and it is recognized by
the health system Nonetheless the role of CAM in
management of HDPs is scarce Evidence from this
study found that mothers who used herbal medicines were
times more likely to have HDPs Some studies have
reported the beneficial use of CAM in pregnancy and how
it has improved on blood pressure levels and also on various
obstetric outcomes
This study s finding does not imply that the use of herbal
medicines negatively increases blood pressure This is
because the study is methodologically limited to the use of
herbal medicines It did not assess the type of herbal medi
cine used how the herbal medicines were used and whether
it was prescribed or was appropriate for use However this
finding reveals a very critical issue of the appropriate use
of herbal medicines in pregnancy Herbal medicines are
made up of several constituents and the safety of their use
should be ascertained Currently there is paucity of infor
mation on the use of herbal medicine in the management
of hypertensive disorders particularly in pregnancy More
research evidence would be needed to understand why preg
nant women in selected health facilities use these medicines
its constituents and appropriateness for use in hypertensive
disorders
Alcohol consumption is known to influence hyperten
Sive disorders in adults Several studies have propounded
that alcohol consumption particularly heavy consumption
increases the risk of hypertension in normotensive individ
uals From this study alcohol consumers were times
more likely to experience HDPs compared to nonalcohol
consumers Alcohol has a biphasic effect on blood pressure
In less than hours after consumption alcohol reduces
blood pressure and subsequently after hours alcohol
tends to increase blood pressure It is believed to influence
the blood pressure through the renin angiotensin aldosterone
system by increasing the concentration and activity of renin
in blood An increase in renin is associated with an
increase in a potent vasoconstrictor called angiotensin II
responsible for the rise in blood pressure Additionally alcohol
is believed to reduce the baroreceptor sensitivity thus affecting
blood pressure regulation at the long term It is advised
that mothers must be counseled during ANC visits to strictly
avoid alcohol intake during pregnancy
The aetiology of these HDPs however is not known
It is therefore recommended that to effectively reduce
the incidence of HDPs pregnant women should be coun
seled on the risk factors of these conditions and screened
for during their antenatal care visits to prevent the adverse
effects of its complications
Some studies have established that HDPs influence the
birth outcomes at delivery From this study mothers who
had HDPs were times more likely to have preterm babies
This finding is consistent with a study by Xiong et al
where it was realized that HDPs increased the risk of stillbirth
by twelvefolds Hypertension is known as the leading cause of
stillbirth by affecting the development of the placenta by
restricting nutrient and oxygen flow to the foetus Also it
increases the risk of abnormal bleeding between the placenta
and uterine walls leading to placenta abruption All these
causes foetal distress and subsequently death Thus it is

and possibly foetal wastage
Another evidence from this study reveals that hyperten
Sive mothers were times more likely to undergo caesar
ean section This finding is consistent with the findings of
Roberts et al where it was realized that HDPs were
associated
with an increased risk of caesarean section
amongst mothers during delivery Considering this evidence
it is recommended that health professionals in charge of
antenatal care critically monitor hypertensive mothers dur
ing care and to pragmatically help to control their blood
pressure to normotensive status before delivery
Conclusion and Recommendations
The overall prevalence of HDPs was with chronic
hypertension superimposed with preeclampsia having the
highest prevalence of Lack of formal education fam
ily history multigravida consumption of alcohol and herbal
preparation were identified as factors that could influence
the risk of HDPs The use oral nifedipine and methyldopa
considerably reduced the proportion of mothers with high
blood pressure The selected mothers with HDPs were likely
to undergo caesarean sections experience stillbirth or have
preterm babies The burden of HDPs is high amongst preg
nant women seeking care in selected facilities There is the
need for intensified campaign on HDPs in the Ashanti
Region of Ghana
Considering the increasing risk of HDPs in the Ashanti
region its increased adverse association to obstetric out
comes such as stillbirth preterm and caesarean section
there is the need to investigate the cost impact of HDPs on
the mother and the household Additionally the quality of
life of mothers diagnosed with HDPs and the impact of
HDPs on the risk of prenatal and postnatal depression
should be assessed further
Strength and Limitations
This study was well powered considering the sample size as
such reducing the risk of type error Additionally the par
ticipants were clearly defined using the inclusion and exclu
Sion criteria outcomes were appropriately measured and
potential confounding factors were considered in the analy
sis Therefore findings of this study are generalizable to
pregnant women seeking antenatal care in the Sub Saharan
African region
This study required mothers to recall past event and this
subjected the responses to recall bias To minimize this bias
where mothers could not recall an event they were permit
ted to skip the item on a questionnaire Additionally this
study does not establish causality but rather provides the
strength of association between the outcome variables and
predictors as such interpretations of the findings should be
done carefully

Background Poor pregnancy risk perception ignorance of obstetric risk symptoms and attitudes toward institutional delivery
services are factors that prevent pregnant women from choosing to receive emergency obstetric treatment
Objective To assess pregnancy risk perception attitude towards skilled delivery service and knowledge of obstetric danger signs
and associated factors among pregnant mothers
Methods A cross sectional community based study design was used The pregnant women who participated in this study were
chosen using a multi stage sampling methodology Data were gathered using a pretested questionnaire that was presented by an
interviewer To find independent factors logistic regression analysis was used With a p value of less than which denotes
statistical significance a corresponding confidence interval CI was calculated
Results Pregnancy risk perception was shown to have a lower mean score overall Only of the study participants had high
pregnancy risk perception Over of respondents had a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization In all categories of
obstetric danger signs only respondents or knew what the obstetric danger signs were Maternal age AOR I CI I
maternal education AOR and parity AOR CI were factors affecting knowledge of
obstetric danger signs Pregnancy risk Perception AOR CI and parity AOR CI I were significantly
associated with attitudes on the use of skilled delivery services
Conclusion This study found that pregnant women in rural locations had poor levels of knowledge of obstetric danger sign attitude
toward using skilled delivery services and perception of pregnancy risk The knowledge of obstetric danger indicators among pregnant
women was considerably affected by the mother s age education and parity The perception of pregnancy risk and parity were found
to be substantially associated with attitudes towards skilled delivery services

Background
In too many women died from pregnancy related causes and childbirth related causes Complications during and
after childbirth claimed the lives of close to women Most of these deaths were avoidable and took place
in low income settings Two thirds and one fifth of all maternal deaths occurred in sub Saharan
Africa and Southern Asia respectively Sub Saharan Africa accounted for approximately of all maternal
deaths
Ethiopia is one of the nations most affected by high maternal and newborn deaths Obstetric problems such as
bleeding obstructed labor ruptured uterus pregnancy induced hypertension puerperal infection and unsafe abortions are

the main causes of mother death in Ethiopia Anaemia and malaria were the two most reported indirect causes of
maternal death Ethiopia s maternal and infant mortality rates have reduced by since however they are still
excessively high at per live births and per respectively
Risk perception is the way that individuals judge and assess the hazards to which they may be exposed It appears
that a higher perception of health danger enhances protective motivation thus it is critical to comprehend how people
view health risks how correct these views are and how their perception influences their behaviour High risk pregnant
women s decisions about prenatal care and the care they receive during their pregnancies are greatly influenced by their
risk perception Risk perception is a significant concern particularly during pregnancy when behavioural changes in
health have the potential to affect both the mother and the fetus
Pregnancy related risk perception is a subject that has attracted a lot of attention globally According to a recent
concept analysis women s perceptions about risk during pregnancy have an impact on their decision making during
pregnancy and childbirth Pregnancy related risk perception is a complicated topic because it affects both the mother
and the fetus Because even well intentioned measures may not be successful without this understanding prenatal care
professionals must be aware of how women perceive risk
Unexpected events that happen to pregnant women during pregnancy labor childbirth or postpartum are known as
obstetric danger indicators Among the most frequently observed obstetric danger symptoms include impaired vision
the absence of fetal movements vaginal bleeding a gush of fluid from the vagina high temperature foul smelling
vaginal discharge convulsions abdominal pain and severe headaches More than of maternal mortality in
developing nations are caused by pregnancy related conditions which are preventable
Maternal health promotion
and education for women men and community members to enhance awareness about obstetric danger signs are effective
measures that can prevent birth related complications Henceforth the World Health Organization WHO suggests
educating all pregnant women about obstetric danger signs at each prenatal visit Doing so will enable early detection
of obstetric danger signs and facilitate appropriate emergency obstetric care
Numerous studies revealed that the level of knowledge of obstetric danger signs was low in sub Saharan Africa and
Asia even though recognizing and understanding them plays an important role in reducing both maternal and child
mortality by prompting the decision to seek emergency interventions
Studies have shown that pregnant women put off making decisions to seek obstetric treatment because of poor
understanding of the risks and difficulties in pregnancy related complications
Studies done in Ethiopia revealed that
there is a lack of awareness of obstetric danger signs among pregnant women The majority of the research on
pregnant women s awareness of obstetric danger signs in Ethiopia was conducted in urban and institutional settings This
study helps in identifying the gaps in the community s understanding of obstetric danger signs level of knowledge of
pregnancy risk perception and attitude toward skilled delivery service use among pregnant women in rural areas It will
also be a resource for health service providers policymakers and program managers as they develop intervention
strategies to increase community awareness of obstetric danger signs and pregnancy risk As far as we are aware there
has never been a published study done in the rural environment on the topic Therefore this study sought to evaluate
pregnant women s perceptions of pregnancy risks degree of understanding of obstetric danger signs attitudes toward
using skilled delivery services and related factors in rural areas of Hadiya Zone Southern Ethiopia
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This study was conducted in two districts of Hadiya Zone Lemo and Ameka districts Hadiya Zone is situated
kilometers from Addis Ababa the capital city of Ethiopia in the South nation and nationalities regional state of Southern
Ethiopia The study took place between February and March A cross sectional study with a focus on the
community was used
All of the pregnant women who lived in the two districts during the study period comprised the source population
Participants who were gravely ill and unable to communicate were not included in this study This study was part of a cluster
randomized control trial study that examined the effectiveness of engagement of religious leaders in maternal health

education It is part of the baseline survey The sample size was determined based on a cluster randomized control trial study
design According to the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey skilled birth attendance in a rural area of Ethiopia
was predicted to be The sample size was based on power to detect a percentage point anticipated difference in
the proportion of skilled delivery service utilization an increase from to With a error level and design effect of
A sample size of pregnant mothers per cluster was required and accordingly the final calculated sample size was per
pregnant mothers per group after considering a loss
Twelve clusters from two Hadiya Zone districts were involved in this study Lemo and Ameka districts In order to locate
clusters kebeles a simple random sampling technique was used Pregnant women were then contacted using a cluster
sampling technique Interviews with pregnant women who met the inclusion requirements were conducted for the study The
participants in the baseline study did not Intend to leave their current residence before the completion of the follow up period
In cooperation with health extension workers and kebele leaders a census was carried out to determine all eligible pregnant
women of reproductive age years who permanently resided in the selected districts from the selected clusters Once
pregnancy was detected through census work the women would be recruited for the study
Data Collection and Procedure
We used questionnaires that already existed from studies done before and adapted them to fit our needs The questionnaires
were pretested and administered by an interviewer They were developed by the Johns Hopkins Program for International
Education in Gynaecology and Obstetrics JHPIEGO maternal and neonatal health program and we tweaked them to fit the
local context and our research goals We pre tested a survey among pregnant mothers who were not a part of the main
study The survey had five sections socio demographic obstetrics risk perception danger signs during pregnancy labor
delivery and postpartum period and attitude The data collectors went to respondents houses and interviewed them in person
to gather the data We recruited data collectors clinical nurses and BSc nurses and supervisors BSc degree in public
health We chose them based on their data collection experience and fluency in the language of the community They were
then trained on the objectives of the study the survey and the data collection process The principal investigators and
supervisors double checked the surveys to make sure they were complete and relevant
Quality Control
Internal consistency reliability was tested by calculating Cronbach s Alpha using SPSS window version
Furthermore health behavior experts crosschecked the content validity of the tool Data collectors and supervisors
were trained about the study instrument and data collection procedure The principal investigator and the supervisors
checked the collected data for completeness
Measurement and Operational Definitions of the Scale Variables
Pregnancy risk perception was assessed using the questionnaire developed from a previous study This questionnaire is made
up of nine questions which assess how a pregnant women perceive potential dangers during pregnancy In this study the
questionnaire consists oftwo subscales that include four questions about the risk to self mother for example Is the risk of
having a caesarean section and five questions about risk to the baby for example is a risk of baby having a birth defect
Respondents were asked to rate on a five pomt scale no risk at all unlikely possible High extremely high
how they perceived the pregnancy risk The scores from each of the items were added up to get a total pregnancy risk
perception score A higher score means that the person has a greater perception of risk The mean score was used to divide
people into two groups those with a high perception of risk and those with a low perception of risk
Pregnant women in this study mentioned danger signs during pregnancy delivery and postpartum period We
measured how much they knew about these danger signs by asking them to name them without giving leading questions
We sorted their knowledge into two categories pregnant women with good knowledge and pregnant women with poor
knowledge In this study a pregnant woman was deemed to be knowledgeable about the danger signs if she could either
spontaneously or upon prompting name at least three significant danger signs for each of the three periods of pregnancy
childbirth and postpartum The mothers were prompted by giving them more time to attempt and recall these periods

Attitude toward skilled delivery service utilization has items that were measured by using a Likert scale where
respondents were supposed to strongly agree agree neutral disagree and strongly disagree The overall attitude score
was computed by summing up the items after performing the reverse scoring for negatively worded sentences A higher
composite score indicated a more positive attitude The Mean score was used to categorize attitudes into positive and
negative attitudes
Data Processing and Analysis
Data were cleaned and entered using Epidata version and analyzed using SPSS version Logistic regression was
carried out to identify determmants of obstetric danger signs knowledge Variables with p in the bivariate analysis
were selected as candidate variables for multivariate logistic analysis to control the effect of confounders Adjusted odd
ratios AORs with their confidence interval and p were considered to have a significant association between
the outcome and independent variables The model fitness was checked using Hosmer and Lemeshow and was found fit

Factors Associated with Attitude Toward Skilled Delivery Service Utilization
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis perception of pregnancy risk and parity were significantly associated with
attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization Pregnant mothers with a high perception of pregnancy risk were
times more likely to have a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization than pregnant mothers with low

Discussion
The majority of preventable maternal deaths in developing countries are due to delays in the pregnant mother or her
family s decision to seek care delays in visiting the place of delivery and delays in receiving adequate hospital care In
such cases the lack of knowledge about pregnancy risk and obstetric danger signs and attitude towards skilled delivery
service utilization contribute to the delays in seeking emergency obstetric care resulting in high mortality and morbidity
rates Pregnant mothers can avoid obstetric complications if they can identify the forewarning pregnancy risks and
obstetric danger signs In resource limited countries like Ethiopia increasing the level of awareness of obstetric danger
signs and skilled delivery service utilization among women are feasible strategies to reduce maternal mortality and

morbidity related to obstetric complications However the pregnancy risk perception and level of knowledge are low
among women in Southern Africa including Ethiopia
This study was conducted to assess the current
pregnancy risk perception attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization and level of pregnant women s knowledge
of obstetric danger signs and related factors in rural areas in Hadiya Zone Southern Ethiopia
The result showed that more than half of pregnant mothers had a low perception of obstetric risks and the total and
a low mean score of pregnancy risk perception of This finding is lower than the one reported using different
instruments to measure pregnancy risk perception in Northern Ethiopia This study found that of respondents had
a high level of pregnancy risk perception The mean score in our study score is lower than the findings reported in
Canada mean score which utilized the same instrument to measure pregnancy risk perception among nulliparous
Canadian women of advanced maternal Similarly a study in Thailand found that women of advanced maternal age had
mean scores of perception of pregnancy risk that fell below This difference might be because of the difference
in maternal age and measurement instruments Another possible explanation is that risk perception in pregnancy is
multifaceted and influenced by multiple personal factors
In this research the overall proportion of knowledge of obstetric danger signs among pregnant mothers was
This finding is consistent with the finding reported in South Ethiopia in Yirgachefe city and Eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo Our study was done among rural mothers In this study the knowledge
of obstetric danger signs was higher than the findings reported in Wolayita Sodo City in Southern Ethiopia and
Jordan
In addition it is lower than the values reported by studies conducted in Chamwino District Tanzama
Angolela Tera District in Northern Ethiopia Hossan Town Southern Ethiopia Shashemane
Town in the Oromia region in Ethiopia and KwaZulu Natal in South Africa This discrepancy could be
differences in the sociocultural backgrounds that characterize each of these regions
In this study obstetric danger signs were categorized into three parts pregnancy labor childbirth and the postpartum
period The danger signs that were most frequently discussed during pregnancy were weakness vaginal
bleeding and reduced fetal movement which is contradictory to a study reported in the Eastern

Democratic Republic of the Congo which found that severe abdominal pain was the best known danger sign This
result was in line with other research findings published in Ethiopia and Africa and revealed that severe vaginal bleeding
was the frequently mentioned obstetric danger sign during pregnancy and postpartum period
Labor of more
than hours and abnormal fetal position were the most common danger Signs mentioned by study participants during
labor and childbirth This finding was consistent with the finding reported in Wolayita Sodo Town Southern Ethiopia
In this study the age of pregnant mothers maternal education and parity were determinants of knowledge of obstetric
danger signs Pregnant mothers aged years were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of
obstetric danger indicators This result is consistent with results from other studies that have been done in Arbaminch
Wolayita Sodo and Yirgacheffe Towns South Ethiopia and South Eastern Nigeria Women in this age category are
believed to be physically and psychologically ready to accept information about obstetric danger signs This result
contradicts a study conducted in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo that found women aged years
were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators
In this study maternal age education and parity were determinants of knowledge of obstetric danger signs Pregnant
mothers aged years were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators
This result is consistent with results from other studies that have been done in Arbaminch Wolayita Sodo and
Yirgacheffe Towns South Ethiopia and South Eastern Nigeria Women in this age category are believed to be physically
and psychologically ready to accept information about obstetric danger signs This result contradicts a study conducted in
the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo that found women aged years were more likely than other age
groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators
The multivariate logistic regression revealed that
the knowledge of obstetric danger signs among pregnant women was associated with parity The probability of knowing
obstetric danger signs decreased by among primipara mothers compared to nullipara mothers This finding contra
dicts the finding reported in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo However it is consistent with the results
reported in other studies
In this study the mean score of attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization was More than half of the study
participants had a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization This finding was lower than the
finding reported in Oromia Region Ethiopia Our finding is higher than the result reported in Northwest Ethiopia
A possible explanation could be differences in study setting and health program implementation This study
revealed that pregnant mothers with a high perception of pregnancy risk were more likely to have a positive attitude toward
skilled delivery service utilization than pregnant mothers with a low pregnancy risk perception This is because having risk
perception could develop a positive attitude towards health service utilization The utilization behavior of individuals is
driven by their perception to develop a positive attitude and take over the action It was also observed that pregnant mothers
who were multiparous were more likely to have a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization than
nulliparous pregnant mothers This may be because pregnant mothers who experienced previous births were more likely
to benefit from maternal health services and learn from their experiences
The results of this study have important policy implications Determining the level of the pregnancy risk perception
knowledge of obstetric danger signs and attitude of pregnant women towards skilled delivery service utilization can
predict their preventive practice and identifying variables is crucial for developing appropriate risk communication
methods and measures
Limitations
Regarding limitations of this study bias might be provoked in prompting the participants to mention the danger signs
though the authors tried their best to avoid it In addition reports of the pregnant mothers may under overestimate the
result because the data was collected by self report
Conclusion
In this study pregnancy risk perception attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization and level of pregnant
women s knowledge of obstetric danger indicators in Lemo and Ameka Districts of Hadiya Zone were low

The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments
childhood mortality and health of surviving children

Abstract
The potential death toll from an epidemic is larger than the number of deaths directly
associated with the infection In this study we find that prenatal exposure to a cholera
epidemic in Peru increased childhood mortality and that surviving children were
more likely to be underweight and to suffer from diarrhea We further find that a sig
nificant part of this mortality happened during the first day of life and that prenatal
exposure to cholera decreased prenatal care and institutional deliveries suggesting
that the mortality and possibly other longer term effects were partially driven by a
reduction in prenatal investments

Introduction
Epidemics have been on the rise for the past several decades and will likely continue
to do so in the near future The potential death toll attributable to an epidemic is
considerably larger than the number of deaths directly associated with the infection
Children exposed to an epidemic while in utero are particularly vulnerable infected

pregnant women can transmit the disease through the placenta and even if the virus
or bacteria does not affect the fetus directly symptoms of the disease such as dehy
dration high fever or stress can affect the fetus in ways that are not visible until after
the child is born or even later in life Additionally the economic hardship that an
epidemic imposes to pregnant women and their households and the potential satu
ration of the healthcare capacity can affect parental investments including maternal
nutrition vaccines and skilled care during pregnancy and during birth We know
from a number of studies in epidemiology and economics that in utero is a critical
developmental period and that shocks during this period including epidemics have
long term consequences Almond and Currie We know less about their effect
on postnatal childhood mortality and the potential mediating role of prenatal invest
ments In this study we aim to contribute to this literature by exploring the effects of
prenatal exposure to the Peruvian cholera epidemic in the early
There have been seven cholera pandemics in the last years The seventh began
in the early in Asia and spread through Africa and Europe in the early
Cholera rates remained relatively low during the and were confined to Asia
and Africa but in the early an outbreak began in Peru that became the first
cholera epidemic in Latin America since Lam et al Peru suffered the
most severe outbreak of cholera of the region and the health system collapsed in many
regions of the country Cueto With a large majority of the population work
ing informally without access to medical paid leave the epidemic also generated
important economic consequences for households and Bradford
From an empirical perspective studying the cholera epidemic in Peru is conve
nient because it began unexpectedly Disease control experts are largely at a loss to
explain why cholera has returned to South America in the first epidemic since
Brookes p The bacteria seemed to originate from the Pacific Ocean the
first cases spread from the coastal cities of Peru to other regions of the country and
later to other countries as well The abruptness and severity of the epidemic as well
as the speed of contagion provide us with a nearly ideal natural experiment In April
a professor from the University of Maryland School of Medicine commented
about the cholera epidemic in Peru It s pure guesswork as to where it is going
Brookes p In retrospect it seems that the spread of the disease over differ
ent regions of the country over time in particular during the first year of the epidemic
was largely determined by each region s geographical proximity to the initial cases
Within a region contagion was more likely under unsanitary conditions but not even
households with access to piped water at home were safe from contagion because
water was not sufficiently chlorinated Cueto
We apply a difference in difference methodology exploiting the spread of the
cholera epidemic in Peru by month and region Our data comes mainly from two
sources the Population Census of in which mothers were asked the birth date
of their youngest child born alive and whether or not that child was alive at the time
of the interview and the Health and Demographic Survey of which includes
information of childhood mortality and parental investments and allows us also to
control for mother fixed effects

We find that an increase in I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during
the last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by per
centage points or according to our most conservative estimate The event study
shows that this effect was not driven by a pre existing trend We also find that later
mortality is concentrated in girls and that surviving children are more likely to suffer
from severe diarrhea and have lower weight for age and are more likely to be under
weight Finally we find that the epidemic increased first day mortality and reduced
prenatal care and institutional deliveries suggesting the mortality and possibly other
longer term effects were partially driven by a reduction in prenatal investments
There is a well established literature that shows that in utero is a particular sensi
tive stage in life for the formation of human capital Most of this literature focuses
on long term effects of prenatal exposure to a variety of shocks Almond and Currie
The seminal study of Almond finds that in utero exposure to the
influenza pandemic had long term negative effects in terms of education attainment
physical disability income and socioeconomic status Closely related to our study
Ogasawara and Inoue and Ritter find negative long term effects of pre
natal exposure to the cholera epidemic among adults in Japan and Peru respectively
A relatively smaller number of studies have shown that in utero shocks may have an
effect on postnatal childhood mortality In particular it has been shown that expo
sure to pollution Jayachandran extreme rainfall Rocha and Soares
extreme heat Banerjee and Maharaj and violent conflict Dagnelie et al
increases infant mortalityl This paper aims to contribute to this literature by ana
lyzing the effect of prenatal exposure to an epidemic on childhood mortality Our
results are particularly relevant in a context where official reports of deaths due to
epidemics in many countries differ considerably from estimations of the number of
excess deaths FT These estimations however do not disentangle what pro
portion of the excess deaths is due exclusively to underreporting of direct deaths from
that attributable to indirect deaths According to our estimations the total number of
children who died due to exposure to the cholera epidemic while in their last trimester
in utero was approximately while the official number of total cholera deaths for
is This means that the human cost of the epidemic was approximately
larger if we consider the effect of prenatal exposure on postnatal childhood mor
tality Moreover the official mortality rate from the cholera epidemic in Peru during
is in every inhabitants while our estimated mortality rate due to
prenatal exposure is in every children that were born alive in
With this paper we also aim to contribute to the literature by providing evidence of
the potential role of prenatal investments in particular prenatal care and institutional
deliveries as mediators between the in utero shock and the effect on childhood mor
tality and possibly longer term human capital outcomes Prenatal care is important to
prevent and treat conditions that might affect the mother and or the fetus but it is also
Other important studies that investigate postnatal early childhood shocks on mortality rate are included
in the review of Almond et al
As of July Peru has more than excess deaths per million inhabitants the highest rate in the
world which largely exceed reported numbers of Covid deaths Fl

important because it can affect maternal behavior such as smoking alcohol consump
tion nutrition and weight gain folic acid intake among others see for example
Evans and Lien and these behaviors have been shown to affect birth outcomes
and have long term human capital outcomes Aizer and Currie Nilsson
Simon Bharadwaj et al Barreca Institutional deliveries typically
involve skilled professionals with adequate equipments during and immediately after
birth which are important because they can perform C sections when needed resus
citate newborns at birth and treat maternal infections among other things According
to the World Health Organization approximately of all under five child deaths
are neonatal deaths and approximately half of all neonatal deaths occur after a home
birth and without any healthcare
There is also more rigorous evidence of the impact of institutional births and
access to healthcare on birth outcomes and infant lives Currie and Gruber
Maitra Daysal et al Godlonton and Okeke Goodman Bacon
Adam et al Okeke and Chari Friedman and Keats a Moreover
there is evidence that skilled care during and immediately after birth can treat prema
turity underweight and other conditions affecting newborns with proper care such as
artificial lung surfactant and specialized nutritional supplements that has long term
consequences on human capital Bharadwaj et al Epidemics have the poten
tial to affect access to prenatal care and institutional deliveries this has been seen for
example in the case of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa Jones et al Strong
and Schwartz although this evidence comes from correlational studies The
Ebola epidemic is probably an extreme case given the high probability of getting
infected in hospitals in addition to the fear of getting tested and isolated Strong and
Schwartz WHO In the case of COVID there is evidence that the
lockdown in India increased mortality rate by among dialysis patients The main
channels in this case appear to be barriers to transportation and disruption in hospital
services Jain and Dupas
In this study we show that even epidemics involving less contagious diseases
and that do not impose a need for social isolation such as the cholera epidemic can
generate a reduction in prenatal care and institutional deliveries Moreover many
other shocks that have been analyzed in the fetal origins literature droughts wars
famines and hurricanes among other things have the potential to affect access to
skilled care during pregnancy and birth hence the results of this paper can apply to
a wide range of shocks
Finally this paper speaks to the literature on diarrheal diseases childhood mor
tality and malnutrition Although we have found that the cholera epidemic reduced
prenatal investment we cannot discard the potential direct role of the disease in our
mortality estimates and on the health status of the surviving children The World
Health Organization estimates that each year diarrheal diseases such as cholera kill
around half a million children under five and are the leading cause of malnutrition
On a positive note Christensen et al show that certain interventions focused on enhancing health
worker performance led to improvements in maternal utilization of clinics during the Ebola crisis in rural
Sierra Leone
Springer
The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments childhood
Typically these estimates come from contemporaneous effects of these diseases and
hence most programs target children after they are born This study suggests how
ever that protecting children from these diseases after they are born might already be
too late
Background cholera and the cholera epidemic in Peru
Cholera is one of the most common diarrheal diseases along with Rotavirus E coli
Shigella Campylobacter and Salmonella WHO It is generated by a bacte
rial infection The main effect is acute diarrhea and all the other consequences are
believed to derive from this main effect Seas and Gotuzzo Profuse diarrhea
causes dehydration pathogens damage the intestines causing an excessive amount of
water and other nutrient rich fluids to be secreted rather than being absorbed Among
pregnant women particularly during the third trimester severe dehydration is associ
ated with a reduction of amniotic fluid reduced blood flood to the placenta placental
hemorrhage hypotension preterm births and miscarriages Grados and Battilana
Grout et al Hirschhorn et al Ciglenecki et al
Over the last years there have been cholera pandemics The last pandemic
still lingers in many countries As of approximately billion people were
at risk for cholera and approximately million cholera cases occur annually in
countries where it is endemic while approximately cholera cases occur in
non endemic countries Ali et al In terms of deaths approximately
and people are reported to die annually of cholera in endemic countries and
non endemic countries respectively these numbers do not include estimations of the
impact on mortality derived by in utero exposure to the disease Today approximately
million of individuals live in hotspots with a prevalence of cholera higher than
WHO Most of these hotspots are located in African countries and the
rest are located in the Middle East and Central Asia where the healthcare capacity
and quality is very poor Moreover the spread of cholera around the world is likely
to increase due to global warming Chowdhury et al Shope Emch et al
The cholera epidemic in Peru started in the early in the middle of an eco
nomic crisis Real GDP per capita fell circa between and Paxson
and Schady The situation of the health sector was also precarious Individuals
were supposed to have access to free healthcare including prenatal services labor
and delivery In practice however the capacity of the health sector was very limited
The public expenditure in health in was of the GDP one of the lowest from
Latin America at the time Many health centers did not function normally because of
a lack of personnel Pollarolo The travel costs for many individuals were sig
nificantly high given the long distances to the closest health center some times as far
as or more hours away INEI In addition there were important opportunity
costs in particular for informal workers the large majority of workers for whom a
day without working was a day without earnings
Naturally a health system like this was not prepared to deal with an epidemic
Many hospitals simply collapsed and the probability of a patient being rejected due
Springer
P l Ritter R A Sanchez
to lack of capacity or personnel increased significantly Here are some quotes that
reflect this situation
hospitals received a growing number of patients that was sometimes four
times greater than the number of bed and staff available In several cities staff
had to be taken from other hospital services to look after cholera some hos
pitals focused only on patients stricken with the disease and the physicians
requested the help of one relative per patient According to one physician from
Cajamarca hospital during the epidemic all doctors had to forget their original
specialty Cueto p
The emergency room of the hospital looked like a battlefield Sick
patients barely fit in the suffocating room Some of them were seated ted on
the floor other lying in beds and others many were left to lie on the floor
l The few nurses and auxiliary personnel extraordinarily called were insuf
ficient to assist the patients Several nuns with their white robes joined the
effort to attend patients In some cases even police officers became sponta
neously improvised nurses our translation from p
IN Valdivia Rey
The lack of capacity to attend patients during the cholera epidemic was very
generalized according to a nationally representative survey applied in October and
November only of people who were sick and wanted to get attention got
access to health services Pollarolo This evidence illustrates how the cholera
epidemic increased the costs of getting access to healthcare in that it eroded the
already limited capacity of the health sector increasing the patients waiting hours
and the probability of being rejected It is not surprising therefore that we find that
the cholera epidemic reduced prenatal care and institutional births
The epidemic reached suspected cases and a total of deaths a mor
tality rate of per inhabitants and per cases in the first year
and a total of accumulated suspected cases and accumulated deaths
by September By the end of the disease had spread to fourteen countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean totaling cases with Peru responsible
for of all cases presented in the Americas et al The epidemic
was caused by the bacterium Vibrium zero group Lanata The
means of contagion is through food handling and consumption with drinking water
being the most common vehicle of dissemination Gotuzzo Maguifia Vargas
et al Working age adults were disproportionally affected by the disease and
becoming infected with cholera typically resulted in medical expenses as well as to
days without working and Bradford
Figure I shows that the largest number of cases was reported in the number
decreasing over time with a peak of approximately per inhabitants per week
in the regions of the jungle The mortality rate was also much higher in as we
can see in Fig
As explained in the Introduction disease control experts could not explain why
cholera returned to South America in nor could they predict where it was going
Brookes In retrospect however several factors seemed to influence the inten
sity of the disease by region and time The first of these is the geographical location

and time of the first case The disease was first reported in the areas around the coastal
cities of Chancay Chimbote and Piura at the end of January Epidemiological
studies suggest that the massive contamination of phytoplankton and seafood in the
warm part of the sea in the North of Lima explains the explosive spread of the dis
eases Gotuzzo Maguifia Vargas et al In general cholera is more likely
to develop in coastal ecologies Collins Importantly this is believed to be the
first case not just the first diagnosis since adults and children had been tested for
some time before without any sign of the bacterium Vibrium Cholerae Gotuzzo
From these zones the epidemic advanced to other urban and rural areas of
Peru spreading from coast to the highlands finally penetrating the Peruvian jungle
as we can see in Fig

in the first months of the year when it is summer on the coast it spread more homo
geneously over the year in the jungle where it is warm and humid all year around
and the incidence of cholera in the highlands is lower which is colder and drier all
year around
Naturally poor levels of basic sanitation with inadequate processing of drinking
water also seems to have influenced the expansion of the epidemic Gotuzzo
Maguifia Vargas et al Water even piped water was commonly not or not
sufficiently chlorinated and low water pressure and continuous breakdowns in the
service forced people to store water in containers where contaminations was even
more likely Untreated sewages emptied into the sea rivers and lakes or used to
irrigate agricultural land Cueto
Finally belonging to the human blood group O has been associated with increased
severity of the disease and approximately of the indigenous population in Peru
is blood type O Matson et al Individuals with blood type O are not more
likely to be infected by the bacterium but the cholera toxin exerts a more potent
effect on cells expressing the blood type O associated glycan Harris et al The
relationship between blood type O and the severity of the disease has been confirmed
in very different settings and in the particular case of Peru in it was found that

Data and summary statistics
Our data make use of four sources of information The first source of data is the
Population Census of Peru of INEI which asks women age or older
whether their youngest child born alive is still alive It also asks the birth date month
and year of that child The mortality rate corresponds to the proportion of those
children by cohort and region who have died We restrict our sample initially to
years of cohorts to but in our main specification we narrow the sample
from to for reasons we will explain in Section
The second source of data is the Health and Demographic Survey DHS of
This dataset collects information on all children born alive in the previous years of
the survey and records whether or not they are still alive at the time of the interview
meaning we do not have to rely only on the youngest child in this case Moreover
this data set allows us analyze within siblings effects It also includes information of
parental investment and other nutritional and health question about the children We
also limit this data set to children born until
The third source of data provides information about the incidence of cholera reg
istered in Peru during the years to which was obtained from a report
produced by the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health of
Peru Ognio This information is disaggregated by week year and
region with the exception of Apurimac and Madre de Dios for which information is
lacking
Finally the fourth source of data is from Willmott and Matsuura which
provides terrestrial air temperature and precipitation information per month and
meteorological station which we match to regions
Table shows summary statistics of our sample of children corresponding to the
youngest child born between and to women age or older in Peru
has regions but as we mentioned above we only have data on cholera incidence
in of them There are a total of observations that result from collapsing the
data at the region month level We weight the means by the number of children born
alive per region and month
Children are on average years old The mothers are on average years old
are indigenous have an average of children in total years of educational
attainment and of them are illiterate Forty nine percent of the children have
piped water at home have access to a toilet or cesspit The average mortality
rate is I The average temperature and rainfall by trimester was oc and mm
respectively
The average cholera incidence during the third trimester in utero for those chil
dren born in is for children born before that year the incidence is zero
with a maximum incidence of The cholera incidence is calculated by dividing
the number of cases by the population of the region as of Cholera cases are
collected from diagnosis made on the basis of symptoms not blood tests This type

exploit the within sibling variation We weight the means using the sampling weights

Approximately half of the births are institutional births that is in public hos

More precisely of birth are at home are in hospitals health centers and
private clinics or offices and is others Approximately of births that occur in
medical institutions or health centers are assisted by a doctor or obstetrician On the
contrary less than of the births at home are assisted by a doctor Most of them are
assisted by a traditional midwife typically without license a relative or no body

with the date of each prenatal control as well as with special comments of the doc
tor for example whether the woman is experiencing problems with the pregnancy
This information represents a complement and a more objective measure than the
mothers report of whether they had prenatal controls Similarly reported having
had a tetanus vaccine The tetanus vaccine was during those years the only vaccine
required to be given to pregnant women It has a duration of years and it is typically
administered to the pregnant woman in her second or third trimester
Empirical strategy
We estimate three models We first apply a difference in difference DD approach
or more accurately a Fuzzy difference in difference De Chaisemartin and
d Haultfoeuille exploiting differences in the intensity of the cholera epidemic
by month and region Under certain conditions that we explain below this model esti
mate a Local Treatment Effect on the switchers or compliers We collapse the data
at the region month level and weight the regressions by the number of children born
alive per region and month In Appendices A and B we show the estimation using
total population as weights instead Our main specification is the following
t t t pm t r
where stands for the mortality rate as of July of Census interview date
of children born alive in month m and year t to women age or more in
who at the time of the census lived in region r Unfortunately we do not know the
region of residence when a given woman was pregnant with her treated child but in
Appendices A and B we estimate our results using only children born to women who
did not relocate during the years preceding the census between and
and our results are very similar
ChJrm t stands for the cholera incidence during the jth trimester in utero of the
child For example Ch
Ica represents the week incidence before April
in the region of Ica Our data does not provide day of birth so we assume all
children were born on the day of the month Our data also does not provide
information on gestational age at birth hence we assume weeks of gestation and
we follow the medical literature regarding the definition of the trimesters the first
trimester comprises weeks I to the second trimester comprises weeks to and
the third trimester comprises weeks to Exposure to cholera however could
have reduced gestational age at birth So in Appendices A and B we estimate our
regressions assuming and weeks of gestation
The medical literature affirms that third trimester is the most sensitive for cholera
cases Hirschhorn et al but we also estimate the effect of exposure to cholera
during the other trimesters to confirm this previous result In addition we estimate
the effect of exposure to cholera in the first trimester after birth because prenatal and
postnatal incidence of cholera might be correlated and postnatal exposure may also
have an effect on childhood mortality Cholera incidence of further away periods is
Springer
The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments childhood
less likely to be correlated with the incidence while in utero and less likely to affect
childhood mortality since typically around half of childhood mortality happens soon
after birth Finally we additionally estimate the effect of exposure to cholera in the
trimester before conception as a placebo test
pm t stands for month year of birth fixed effects Qnt r stands for month region fixed
effect d rtrend stands region specific trends and stands for control variables
ethnicity number of children which in this case is also the birth order age and
education of the mother whether or not they have access to piped water to a toilet or
cesspit and average temperature and rainfall by trimester in utero Standard errors are
clustered at the regional level Since we only have data from regions in the census
and regions in the survey we present the p values of wild bootstrap inferences to
correct for the small number of regions following Cameron et al
This empirical strategy addresses several potential sources of bias First of all
the regions fixed effects control for time invariable regional variables that might be
correlated with cholera infection and childhood mortality Second the region specific
trends control for the underlying trends in mortality which were already increasing
during those years in most regions The region month of birth fixed effects control
for regional specific seasonal variables that can be correlated with the intensity of
cholera and childhood mortality Finally the month and year birth effects control for
any potential nationwide shock that could affect mortality rates during those months
Month and year birth effects also control for differences in mortality by children age
As with any other DD application we assume that our results are not biased by
changes in unobservable variables that are correlated both with the cholera epidemic
and with childhood mortality As a way to increase the credibility of this assumption
in Appendix A we show with placebo regressions that our observable variables do
not vary meaningfully with the variation in cholera intensity that we exploit We also
restrict the sample to those born by the first semester of with the objective of
including only children who were conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic and
in this way rule out the possibility that our results are generated by selective fertility
In addition to the traditional assumptions a Fuzzy DD approach has two addi
tional assumptions a stable treatment effect over time and homogeneous treatment
effects for switchers of both treatment and comparison groups Our comparison
group are region months combinations that were affected by the cholera epidemic
in a smaller degree than the region months combinations from treatment group
In Appendix A we relax these assumptions and estimate Intertemporal Treatment
Effects following de Chaisemartin and D Haultfoeuille
Our second model is an event study similar to that of Cutler et al and Alpert
et al among others This non parametric model allow us to test whether the
intensity of the cholera epidemic was greater in regions and months in which child
hood mortality and our other outcomes were already growing The following is our
event study specification

stands for cholera incidence corresponding to the last trimester in utero
of the child of region r born in month m of year Thus gives us the effect
on mortality of a percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children
who effectively were in utero in while Fl gives us the effect on mortality of a
I percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children who were in utero
in a year before the epidemic started gives us the effect on mortality of a
I percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children who were in utero
in years before the epidemic started and so forth It is important to note that
even in the absence of pre existing trends for t are not necessarily equal
to because they give us the effect on mortality of postnatal exposure to cholera
However the largest part of childhood mortality happens in the first year of life and
so most of the children that die in our sample has already died before their first
year of life and so for t should be noisier and probably smaller than the
effect of the exposure while in utero More importantly if the event study shows no
long term trend in increasing mortality rates leading up to the cholera epidemic then
that is evidence that our effects are not endogenously driven by omitted variables
correlated with the spread of the epidemic
Finally we estimate a third model with the survey data applying the same DiD
strategy but including a mother s fixed effects Working with this data and empirical
strategy has advantages and disadvantages The main disadvantage is that we have
considerably less statistical power for our estimations first we only exploit within
sibling variation second the data contains a representative but small sample of the
population and third the data is divided in larger regions instead of the Hence
we lose much of the cross sectional variation
The main advantage of this augmented empirical strategy and additional data set
is that it removes several of the concerns that we have with our first model and data
First of all this model controls for selection at the mother s level As we have seen
in the Introduction while not even experts seemed to have anticipated the cholera
epidemic at that precise time with our DD model we cannot completely discard the
possibility that the effects are driven by differences in the sample of women who gave
birth during the cholera epidemic With this third model however we control for
such potential differences Second with the census data we estimate only the effect
on last born child hence should we not want to assume the same average treatment
effect between last born and early born children our first model estimates a Local
Treatment Effect LATE on last born children With this third model and data how
ever we include all children age to irrespective of whether or not they were last
born I lence the external validity of this model is greater Third since the data we use
to estimate this model was collected at the end of and at the beginning of
it reduces the likelihood that the region of residence is other than the native region
of children exposed to the epidemic Finally with this data we observe the age of
death and hence we can estimate the effects on mortality by age of death For more
robustness and sensitivity tests on this model please see our Appendix B
Before concluding this empirical section we would like to make a final note about
our main regressor Other studies use maternal infection rate as the main regressor
for example Almond Unfortunately we do not have mother s infection rate
or infection by gender or age However we believe our regressor cholera incidence

at the regional level is a more appropriate way to address our research question
With the Covid epidemic we now know more than ever that an epidemic can
affect individuals not just through the disease itself but through other mechanisms
We believe this is part of our contribution to the literature By exploiting the variation
of the cholera incidence at the regional level we incorporate the potential effects
of for example the saturation of the health infrastructure of a region This can be
particularly harmful for pregnant women that need attention several times during
their pregnancies and of course during the delivery This is especially true in poor
countries and was especially true during the cholera epidemic in Peru as we have
seen above
Results from census data
Table presents the estimated effects of exposure to cholera on childhood mortality
according to different specifications The first column shows the effects of estimat
ing the difference in difference specification for the entire period between January
and July We estimate the effect of the three trimesters in utero All
regressions include birth month year and month region fixed effects region specific
trends and control for ethnicity birth order or number of children born alive age
and education of the mother whether they have access to piped water to a toilet and
temperature and rainfall by trimester p values of wild bootstrap inferences shown
in parentheses and confidence intervals shown in brackets According to the
first column exposure during the trimester has the greatest effect on childhood
mortality an increase of standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by percentage
points which represents and increase of or standard deviations The med
ical literature also affirms that the third trimester is the most sensitive for cholera
cases Hirschhorn et al We also find that an increase of standard deviation
in the incidence of cholera during the first trimester in utero increases average child
hood mortality rate by percentage points which represents and increase of
or standard deviations Finally we find that an increase of I standard deviation
in the incidence of cholera during the second trimester in utero decreases average
childhood mortality rate by percentage points This result might seem odd at
first however this is actually possible it could be the result of miscarriage and of
the surviving children being a healthier sub set of the total cohort Selective mortal
ity miscarriage has been noticed by many researchers Bozzoli et al Currie
and Vogl In fact according to Saona et al most miscarriages due to
cholera infection in Peru occurred during the first and second trimester of pregnancy
In the rest of the columns we estimate the same regression but restricting our
data to the period between January and December By including only the
first year of the epidemic we reduce the possibility of selective fertility Moreover
since the epidemic was quite unexpected when it appeared but over time individuals
in particular educated individuals became aware of the illness and learned ways to
prevent it we would expect that the effect is less likely to be endogenous in the first
year of the epidemic In Appendices A and B we restrict the sample even further
Springer
The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments childhood
to those born by the first semester of with the aim of including only children
conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic In column we can see that the effect
of exposure to cholera during the third trimester remains statistically significant in
all the specifications In the case of exposure to cholera during the second trimester
the negative effect is no longer statistically significant and in the case of exposure
to cholera during the first trimester the coefficient is statistically significant only
in some of the specifications Columns and show the estimates of exposure to
cholera only during the third and first trimester respectively In particular we can
see that the estimate for the exposure during the third trimester is very insensitive
to controlling for the incidence during other trimesters This result is not surprising
given that the intensity of cholera varied significantly within regions over time even
within months and given that we are working with census data and therefore have
good statistical power
In column we show the effect of exposure during the weeks in utero and
we can see a significant effect on mortality an increase of standard deviation in
the incidence of cholera during the weeks in utero increases average childhood
mortality rate by percentage points or
Column includes the estimation of the effect of cholera during the first trimester
after birth It is somewhat surprising that postnatal exposure during the first trimester
after birth does not affect childhood mortality rate However we need to keep in
mind that typically of childhood deaths happen in the first month after birth
and a third of neonatal deaths occur in the first day of life This means that some
of the children in our sample were not actually exposed to postnatal incidence of
cholera because they were already dead after the first month In fact we will see in
the next section that there is a significant effect on first day mortality Another expla
nation could be that breastfeeding reduced babies exposure to the epidemic There
is evidence that mothers respond in this way to protect babies from contaminated
water Keskin et al This does not have to be a premeditated response since
breastfeeding is very generalized during the first trimester of life
Finally in column we include as a placebo the estimation of the effect on mor
tality of cholera during one trimester before conception It is reassuring to find no
significant effect but this result is not sufficient to prove causality During the
and early Peru was going through a very bad economic situation including an
increase in infant mortality Baird et al Paxson and Schady Hence our
results could be driven by a previous trend Figure shows event study for exposure
during the third trimester and we can see however that there is no previous trend in
those regions and in those months with higher incidence of cholera in in com
parison with the rest of regions and months This result provides good evidence that
our estimation is causal Moreover Fig presents an event study of maternal edu
cational attainment as a placebo test that provides evidence that there was no sample
selection in the mothers of children affected in greater magnitude by the epidemic In
Appendix A we show more placebo tests and robustness checks that increase even
further the reliability of our results The event study for exposure during the first
trimester in Fig shows what we were observing in the regressions a much noisier
and mostly non significant effect on mortality

These results are most likely a lower bound estimate for several reasons first
the epidemic likely generated a sizable number of miscarriages which tend to be
concentrated among those who are physically weakest meaning the survivors will
tend to be a healthier subpopulation Bozzoli et al Currie and Vogl
Second the epidemic killed a large number of adults meaning pregnant women who
survived a cholera infection were probably the healthiest and our sample does not
contain information on motherless children Third we do not have the age of death
for children and we observe only whether children have died before mid and
the epidemic started in Hence we can only see whether the children affected
by the epidemic died at age or before and some children might have died after
reaching that age

Table shows heterogeneous effects by poverty The level of poverty by district
is defined by the proportion of households with at least one unsatisfied basic need
which was calculated by the INEI from the Census We define poor districts
as districts with a larger proportion of poor households than the median district As
expected the effect of exposure to cholera during the third trimester on mortality is
greater among poorer districts Interestingly though the effect of exposure to cholera
during the first trimester on mortality is greater among the less poor districts This
last result could be derived from a smaller number of miscarriages among the less
poor districts which in turn reduces the selection effect
Table also shows heterogeneous effects by maternal education We define
women with high educational attainment as those women with educational attain
ment higher than the median and women with low educational attainment as those
women with educational attainment lower than the median Again as expected the
effect of exposure to cholera during the third trimester on mortality is greater among
children of less well educated mothers
Results from survey data
In this section we present the results from the estimations using the survey Data
DHS One of the shortcomings of this data aside from the obvious fact that
it is a survey and therefore has significantly fewer observations than a census is
that the configuration of regions in this data is different than in our cholera data and
in the census data the country is divided in larger regions instead of the We
thus lose much of the cross sectional variation With this data however we have the
advantage of knowing the age of death and we can estimate within siblings effects
Table presents the estimated effects of exposure to cholera on mortality using this
data In the first column we show the result of running the difference in difference

just as we did with the census data As expected our estimate is significantly less
precise the point estimate of exposure to cholera during the third trimester is approx
imately times larger but it is not statistically significant Columns to show the
effects of estimating the within siblings effect on total mortality on mortality in the
first months of life on mortality in the first month of life and on first day mortality
respectively We concentrate on early life mortality only because at the time of the
survey approximately half of the children born in were less than months old
We can see that including the mother fixed effect approximately triplicates the esti
mate and limiting the age of death to months or less increases the significance We
find that an increase of I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last
trimester in utero increases three month mortality by percentage points or
and first day mortality rate by percentage points or This last result is very
interesting and suggests that a significant part of the deaths might have occurred due
to complications at birth The magnitude of the effects are large but so are the con
fidence intervals the effects represents only and of a standard deviation of
three month mortality and first day mortality respectively Also this is a sample of
mothers less well educated as we saw in the summary statistics
Table shows the effect of the epidemic on some fetal health indicators following
Goodman Bacon sex composition low and very low birth weight size and
gestational age Column shows the effect on the sex composition of children born
alive We do not observe a statistically significant effect on the probability of a child
being born female but we cannot dismiss this possibility out of hand Column
shows the effect on low birth weight Unfortunately only about half of households
answered this question We do not find any significant effect on low birth weight in
our data there are no children with a very low birth weight nor any effect on the
perceived size of the baby at birth as shown in columns and or in the likelihood
of being premature as shown in column In column we follow Kling Liebman
and Katz Anderson and Hoynes et al and construct a summary
indicator for fetal health with the objective of increasing the statistical power of
our estimation This indicator is the simple average across standardized measures of
each component low and very low birth weight size and whether the child was a
preterm baby The standardization of each variable is made by subtracting the mean
and dividing by the standard deviation Since all the indicators of fetal health are
negative we multiply the indicator by to get a positive indicator We can see that
there is no significant effect on this indicator either
Table presents the estimated effects on prenatal investments We find no signif
icant effect on the number of prenatal visits but exposure to cholera during the third
trimester in utero reduces the probability of having an prenatal card and of a mother
having had a tetanus shot in the last years Column shows that exposure to cholera
during the third and first trimester in utero reduces the likelihood of an institutional
birth by percentage points or In column we construct another summary
indicator this time for prenatal investment with the objective of increasing the

find that I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last trimester in
utero decreases prenatal investment by standard deviations These results sug
gest that childhood mortality in particular first day mortality could have been driven
at least in part by the lack of skilled care during pregnancy and birth
With respect to the potential magnitude of the effect of prenatal investments on
mortality the effects for example of institutional births on mortality rates esti
mated by previous studies are significantly large between and Daysal
et al Godlonton and Okeke Okeke and Chari Friedman and Keats
b We find that I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
last trimester in utero reduces institutional births by percentage points Based
on previous studies we would expect an increase in mortality between and
percentage points which corresponds very closely to our estimates I lence a large
proportion of the first day mortality and to a lesser extent month mortality could
be explained by the effect of the cholera epidemic on institutional births and more
generally prenatal investments
Table shows the effects on some health indicators of surviving children at the
time of the interview Columns I and show no significant effect on being ill or
having at least one episode of diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the interview respec
tively Column however shows that an increase of one standard deviation in the
incidence of cholera during the third trimester increases the likelihood of severe diar
rhea defined as diarrhea for at least days by percentage points or Column
shows that an increase of one standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during
the first trimester decreases height for age by standard deviations but column
shows no effect on the probability of the child being stunted Columns and
show that an increase of one standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
first trimester decreases weight for age by standard deviations and increases the
likelihood of being underweight by percentage points or respectively
Tables and show heterogeneous effects In these tables we do not show
the coefficients of the exposure to cholera during the second trimester in order to
save space and focus the attention on our main results We cannot identify districts
in the survey data which is why we cannot construct the heterogeneous effect by
poverty with this data but in this data we observe maternal education and sex of the
child Table shows heterogeneous effects by education The effects on total mortal
ity estimated with the census data month mortality and severe diarrhea estimated
with the survey data are concentrated among children of less well educated mothers
The effect on prenatal investments however is larger for children of better educated
women and the effect on day mortality does not show much difference by edu
cation One potential explanation for these results is that on the one hand the effects
on total mortality month mortality and severe diarrhea are mostly driven by the
impact of the disease while in utero which presumably affected less well educated
women to a greater degree On the other hand the effect on first day mortality is
driven by a combination of the impact of the disease and the impact on prenatal
investments and the latter presumably depends more on the saturation of the health
system in populated areas where women tend to be more educated
A similar pattern can be seen in Table the effects on month mortality and
severe diarrhea are concentrated among female children The effect on prenatal

investments however is larger for males and the effect on day mortality does
not show much difference by sex Larger results for females are not uncommon in
the fetal origins literature This result is typically attributed to stronger fetal sur
Vival for women and a positive selection effect among surviving boys Dagnelie
et al There is not obvious explanation of why the effect of on prenatal invest
ments seems larger for males but again the lack of differential effect by sex on
first day mortality might be explained by the fact that this mortality is driven by a
combination of the impact of the disease while in utero and the impact on prenatal
investments
Magnitude of the effects and estimation of the additional deaths
from the epidemic
With the census data we find that a percentage point incidence of cholera dur
ing the last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by
percentage points With the survey data results are much larger in magnitude but
also significantly less precise Applying the same methodology the point estimate
is approximately five times larger and it is not statistically significant Applying
the fixed effect methodology we find that I standard deviation in the incidence of
cholera during the last trimester in utero increases month mortality rate by
percentage points If we look at the effects in terms of standard deviations the mag
nitudes are not so different from each other with the census data we find an increase
on total childhood mortality of standard deviations while with the survey data
we find an effect on three month mortality of standard deviations Assuming
the difference between the census estimate and the survey estimate using the same
methodology give us the magnitude of the imprecision of the survey estimates we
would expect that the true effect is five times smaller that is approximately per
centage points or As a comparison Jayachandran finds that the wildfires
in Indonesia during the months in late and early caused an increase in the
under three mortality rate of assuming half of the deaths were miscarriages
Rocha and Soares find that I standard deviation increase in rainfall gener
ates a decrease of in infant mortality rate and Banerjee and Maharaj find
that excessive heat during pregnancy days on average increases infant mortality
by
According to our estimation the total number of children who died due to expo
sure to the cholera epidemic while in their last trimester in utero was in the range

extra deaths not estimated in the official number of cholera deaths of which

tality Moreover the official total mortality rate due to postnatal exposure to the

cholera epidemic in Peru is in every inhabitants while our estimated mor
tality rate due to prenatal exposure is in every children who were born
alive in The striking difference in these numbers shows that in utero exposure
to an epidemic can be more deadly than postnatal exposure Naturally this will vary
from epidemic to epidemic cholera might affect children in utero much more than
other diseases Nevertheless we have seen that lack of prenatal investment is also an
important driver of the effect on mortality This means that even if the disease has no
direct effect on the fetus the economic consequences of the epidemic as well as the
saturation of the health system can impose severe consequences in terms of childhood
mortality
Concluding remarks
Epidemics have been on the rise for the past several decades and will likely continue
to do so in the near future Much of the economic literature has focused on the conse
quences of viral outbreaks Influenza V Ebola in spite of the fact that
the number of bacterial outbreaks have increased as much as have the number of viral
outbreaks and the two most common outbreaks in the last two decades have been
bacterial outbreaks Salmonellosis and cholera Smith et al Poor countries
in particular are highly vulnerable to bacterial infections given the high prevalence
of antibiotic resistance WHO and more generally given their lack of access
to basic health services clean water and sanitation WB In this study we find
that an increase in standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last
trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by approximately
according to our most conservative estimate This means that the human cost of the
epidemic was approximately larger if we consider the effect of prenatal expo
sure on postnatal childhood mortality Moreover the official mortality rate from the
cholera epidemic in Peru during is in every inhabitants while our
estimated mortality rate due to prenatal exposure is in every children
that were born alive in
We further find that the epidemic increased first day mortality and reduced prenatal
care and institutional deliveries and that later mortality is concentrated among girls Addi
tionally we find that surviving children are more likely to suffer from severe diarrhea
have lower weight for age and are more likely to be underweight These results
provide evidence that prenatal investments in particular prenatal care and institu
tional deliveries can act as mediators between the in utero shock and the effect
on childhood mortality and possibly also on surviving children s health status and
even longer term outcomes Epidemics in particular but also many other shocks that
have been analyzed in the fetal origins literature droughts wars famines and hurri
canes among other things have the potential to affect access to skilled care during
pregnancy and birth hence the results of this paper can apply to a wide range of
shocks

Appendix A Robustness difference in difference model census
data
This section presents placebo estimates and sensitivity analysis to further increase
the reliability of the results estimated with our first model In these tables we do not
show the coefficients of the exposure to cholera during the second trimester in order
to save space and focus the attention on our main results Table tests whether
mothers who gave birth in regions and times affected by the cholera epidemic are
different from the rest of mothers in several observable variables Columns I to of
show that there is no significant correlation between the variation of the epidemic
that we exploit and the maternal educational attainment in years and levels with the
probability of a mother to be illiterate and with mother s age In column we observe
a negative relationship with respect to the probability of the mother of being indige
nous however this correlation attenuates the effect of the epidemic on childhood
mortality since childhood mortality was larger among indigenous mothers exposed
to the epidemic
Columns and of Table test whether access to piped water and a toilet or
cesspit as opposed to open defecation are correlated with the spread of the disease
We find no significant correlation between these variables and the variation of the
epidemic that we exploit Unfortunately we do not have access to variables regarding
sanitation at the time of the epidemic only at the time of the census years after the
epidemic broke up but it is still reassuring to see no significant correlation These
results are maybe unsurprising since at the regional level and over time and at least
in the first year the abruptness and severity of the epidemic as well as the speed
of contagion make the geographical proximity of the regions to the initial cases the
main drivers of the disease
Columns and of Table present other placebos for the correlation with the
number of children born alive per mother and on the size of the cohort of last chil
dren born alive Pregnancy rates could have decreased as a response to the cholera
epidemic We can see however that there is a statistically significant correlation with
the total number children born alive per women but the correlation is positive and
very small This result is not surprising given that most children in our sample were
conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic Moreover we will see below that our
results remain very similar even when we limit the sample to those children born
in the first semester of that is conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic
Finally the exposure to the cholera outbreak while in utero may have reduced the
probability that a family replace a lost child and this in turn would bias our results
on mortality If that were the case exposure to cholera would reduce the number of
all the children born alive and would increase size of the cohort of last children
born alive As we have seen above there is no negative correlation between expo
sure to cholera during the third trimester and the number of all children born alive
nor is there any positive correlation with the size of the cohort of last children
born alive
Finally Table tests whether temperature are rainfall were correlated with the
spread of the disease Column reveals that there is no significant correlation

between temperature in the third trimester in utero and the variation of the epi
demic that we exploit in that same trimester Likewise column reveals that there
is no significant correlation between temperature in the first trimester in utero and
the variation of the epidemic that we exploit in that same trimester Columns
and show rainfall is indeed positively correlated with cholera incidence Never
theless including or not rainfall as a control in our regressions has virtually no
effect in our results except for additional statistical significance in some of our esti
mates The lack of sensitivity of our results to the inclusion on temperature and
rainfall as control variables is in part due to the inclusion of month region fixed
effects in our regressions which diminish the role of seasonal factors on childhood
mortality
We test the sensitivity of our results to other specifications and samples including
children born to women who did not relocate to a different district during the years
preceding the census between and and our results are very similar We
also show that the estimated effect on mortality is concentrated on those children
born in the first half of that is those who were already in utero when the
epidemic broke out Please refer to Tables A and A of the working paper Ritter
and Sanchez to see these results
As we mentioned in Section a Fuzzy DD approach has two important and
somewhat strong assumptions a stable treatment effect over time and homoge
neous treatment effects for switchers of both treatment and comparison groups We
relax these assumptions and estimate Intertemporal Treatment Effects following de
Chaisemartin and D Haultfceuille and exploiting the Stata command Did
Multiplegt de Chaisemartin et al Please refer to Figure A I to Figure A
and Table A of the working paper Ritter and Sanchez to see these results
This exercise shows that the Fuzzy DiD assumptions are too strong for our setting
but the bias seems to go against our results Since our Fuzzy DiD model is more
conservative and it has more statistical power we keep it as the main specification of
the study
Appendix B Robustness survey data
Table presents placebo regressions for the correlation with birth order tempera
ture and rainfall We do not observe any significant correlation Additionally we test
the sensitivity of our results to other specifications Please refer to Tables B to B

cant effect of exposure to cholera during the first trimester after birth or during one
trimester before conception

ABSTRACT
Background The standard treatment for gestational choriocarcinoma is chemotherapy
Objective To describe the risk of recurrence with expectant management of gestational choriocarcinoma that has
reached a normal human chorionic gonadotropin level after tumor removal without adjuvant chemotherapy
Methods A retrospective multicenter international cohort study was conducted from to involving
gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers with patient s follow up extended until Clinical and
biological data of included patients were extracted from each center s database The inclusion criteria were i
histological diagnosis of gestational choriocarcinoma in any kind of placental tissue retrieved ii spontaneous
normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin level following choriocarcinoma retrieval iii patient did not
receive any oncological treatment for the choriocarcinoma iv and at least months of follow up after the first
human chorionic gonadotropin level normalization
Results Among patients with retrieved gestational choriocarcinoma and whose human chorionic gonado
tropin level normalized without any other oncological therapy none had a recurrence of choriocarcinoma after a
median follow up of months The median interval between choriocarcinoma excision and human chorionic
gonadotropin level normalization was days The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
World Health Organization risk score was in of the cases
Conclusions This multicenter international study reports that selected patients with gestational choriocarcinoma
managed in gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers did not experience any relapse when the initial
tumor evacuation is followed by human chorionic gonadotropin level normalization without any additional
treatment Expectant management may be a safe approach for highly selected patients

Introduction
Gestational trophoblastic diseases GTD encompass among others
premalignant complete and partial hydatidiform moles and malignant
lesions called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia GTN one of which is
gestational choriocarcinoma GCC GCC is a rare and aggressive GTN
subtype with a high metastatic potential Although most GCC occur after
a molar pregnancy they can also be found after any other kind of
pregnancy i e ectopic pregnancy miscarriage or term delivery The
incidence of GCC is estimated to be approximately
term pregnancies and complete hydatidiform mole
Standard treatment of GCC is chemotherapy with a regimen based
on the tumor s risk profile An International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics FIGO World Health Organization WHO scoring sys
tem based on eight prognostic factors has been established to evaluate
the risk of resistance to single agent chemotherapy Low risk tumors
i e with a FIGO WHO risk score lower or equal to are treated with
single agent chemotherapy whereas high risk tumors i e with a FIG
O WHO risk score higher than are treated with multiagent chemo
therapy Monitoring serum human chorionic gonadotropin hCG is
used as a reliable tumor biomarker
The early initiation of low risk GTN adequate treatment is associated
with a year survival rate of However the histology of
choriocarcinoma is predictive of a decreased effectiveness of first line
single agent treatments compared to post mole GTN It has been
suggested that patients with histopathological evidence of choriocarci
noma and a FIGO WHO risk score of or may benefit from upfront
multiagent chemotherapy in case of pre treatment hCG level
mlU mL or metastatic disease
The diagnostic confirmation of GCC often requires expert histo
pathological review which may delay the final pathological diagnosis
During this reviewing interval hCG level can decline spontaneously and
eventually normalize without additional therapy
The objective of this international study conducted in GTD reference
centers was to assess the recurrence rate of GCC after primary complete
tumor removal followed by hCG normalization without adjuvant
therapy

Patients registered in trophoblastic diseases reference centers pro
vided informed consent for anonymous data analysis and storage in local
databases and informed consent was waived if deidentified and anony
mized records were reviewed with institutional review board approval
or ethics committees of the respective participating centers approval
where required
Patients enrollment
Patients were included in this study if they were diagnosed with GCC
in any kind of pathology specimen second third trimester placenta
product of curettage uterus fallopian tube or metastasis resection
Ovarian choriocarcinomas were included only if molecular genotyping
proved the gestational origin Referent pathologists of each center have
systematically reviewed all initial histological diagnoses At least
normal serum hCG level following GCC removal without any additional
treatment was necessary Patients who received a single methotrexate
injection for an initial context of a suspected ectopic pregnancy prior to
the diagnosis of GCC were not excluded from the study At least
months of follow up at one of the reference centers after the first
normalized hCG level was required
Patients with a previous history of GCC cured by chemotherapy or
patients with non gestational choriocarcinoma were excluded
Patients with metastatic disease were not excluded from the study
Initial workup and management of gestational choriocarcinoma
Along with clinical history and physical examination an initial im
aging workup was performed at the time of GCC diagnosis for the
anatomical staging It was considered complete if it included imaging of
all the following anatomical regions pelvis ultrasound or MRI
abdomen CT scan or ultrasound and chest X ray for FIGO score CT
scan imaging Brain evaluation CT scan or MRI was performed
selectively in women with suspected distant lesions
The FIGO WHO risk score was calculated for each patient based on
available data For the item antecedent pregnancy in the absence of
molecular genotyping we considered either the current term pregnancy
for intraplacental choriocarcinoma or the last known pregnancy When
the patient reported no previous pregnancy we scored missed abortion
by default
For the item interval from index pregnancy we used the interval
between last known pregnancy termination and the excision of
choriocarcinoma
We defined the first hCG value available as the item pre treatment
hCG Since the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma was not suspected at the
time of placental removal in most cases first hCG level was measured
after tumor evacuation for of patients n which may have
underestimated the FIGO WHO risk score

had for example no imaging since the hCG level was already normalized

The median interval between GCC primary removal and hCG
normalization was days range For of the patients hCG
level had normalized within months post removal Statistical analysis
showed a correlation between first hCG post evacuation level and time

First hCG post evacuation level accounts for
of total variability of necessary time to tumor marker normal
ization High first hCG post evacuation levels were therefore associated
with a longer interval for hCG normalization

Discussion
Principal findings
This multicentre international study shows no relapses of GCC after
primary complete evacuation followed by hCG level normalization
without any additional treatment These results highlight the opportu
nity to avoid chemotherapy exposure in highly selected patients
Results in the context of published literature
The centralization of care in expert GTD centers has contributed to
the improvement of GCC management in terms of treatment morbidity
and mortality The process of histopathological review in these
reference centers requires time and is associated with a delay between
specimen evacuation final diagnosis of GCC and treatment initiation In
several cases hCG level normalizes within this time interval Manage
ment of patients with normal tumor marker level and no evidence of
residual disease after GCC removal is a particularly controversial issue
Some published data leave open the question whether non
metastatic GCC should be managed with

immediate chemotherapy
Very limited data are available on
the specific subset of patients with normalized hCG level after GCC
evacuation It is not clear if postponing chemotherapy is an
undertreatment
A retrospective study compared expectant management versus im
mediate chemotherapy for low risk and non metastatic GCC In this
population of patients managed by surveillance only achieved
complete sustained remission Interestingly among the cases with
normalized hCG level no patient required chemotherapy which is
concordant with our observation
Regarding the specific condition of intraplacental choriocarcinoma
a systematic review considering non metastatic cases showed no
relapse in out of patients managed by surveillance only
However it is not clear which criteria were applied to decide between
prophylactic chemotherapy or simple surveillance The authors of this
study recommend to avoid adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
non metastatic disease and normal hCG level but lifelong hCG moni
toring is required
The population of the present study is heterogeneous in terms of
pregnancy gestational age first second or third trimester and meta
static status Moreover of patients were older than years old
which is a known risk factor for resistance to monochemotherapy in the
treatment of GCC
The duration of post normalized hCG monitoring is still debated after
chemotherapy for GTN Published data show that most recurrent GTN
appear in the first year of follow up regardless of the FIGO WHO score
risk
Recurrent GCC occurs usually within the years
The
consensus is to follow up patients for at least year after cessation of
therapy though with some centers advocating up to years of
follow up
In the present study the median follow up was
years which is in accordance with practice in most centers and allows
the diagnosis of the vast majority of recurrences
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study are the multicentric international design
and the involvement of recognized expert trophoblastic diseases centers
with systematic histopathological review This cohort of patients is
the largest cohort available in the literature in this very restricted sub
group of patients
We also acknowledge some limitations such as the retrospective
design FIGO scores were calculated thanks to available data sometimes
without knowing the index pregnancy since genotyping is not routinely
done Our conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution and
the surveillance only decision must be validated in a multidisciplinary
expert GTD center to avoid metastatic disease as a deleterious conse
quence of postponing chemotherapy
Clinical and research implications
Our results highlight the consideration of an expectant approach in
highly selected cases of GCC when the hCG level falls and eventually
normalizes after complete tumor removal especially in early stage Iow
risk disease These results need to be validated in a larger and pro
spective study In the future it may change the FIGO recommendation to
initiate chemotherapy in all cases of GCC histology This management
should always be validated by an experienced team in gestational
trophoblastic reference centers
Conclusions
This international multicenter study shows that patients with a pri
mary diagnosis of GCC managed in GTD reference centers do not relapse
when the initial tumor excision is followed by a normalization of hCG
level without adjuvant treatment These results however should be
interpreted with some reservation as they only concern a selected cohort

ABSTRACT
Background Maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality depend on identifying of pregnancy risks
and risk management There is a dearth of information about the experiences of high risk pregnant
mothers in self mitigation of the risk in the socio cultural setting of Iran This research was conducted
to explore the risk management experiences of high risk pregnant mothers
Methods This Qualitative study was conducted in educational hospitals in Mashhad Iran from July
to December The purposive sampling method was used to recruit the participants based on
medical or obstetric high risk conditions in pregnancy Qualitative data were obtained from in depth
and semi structured interviews Mothers experiences of pregnancy in a risky condition were
asked and the interview continued until data saturation Data were analyzed using the MAXQDA
software and the Elo and method
Results Maternal experiences for risk management in pregnancy were formed by nine sub categories
and three categories the excitement of emotion including feeling worry and despair gladness
in the shadow of hope and optimism momentary shocking and excitement and inactivity and
helplessness self contemplation including active analysis of the ways of moderating the risk
cognitive denial and ignoring the risk and witnessed action including problem focused and
rational actions and avoidance and inefficient engagements
Conclusion Risk management experiences of pregnant women with high risk pregnancies include a
wide range of positive and negative feelings effective and ineffective thoughts and behaviors Mutual
collaboration between mothers and midwives obstetricians by providing high quality risk management
counseling can lead to choosing effective risk management strategies

INTRODUCTION
A high risk pregnancy HRP refers to
pregnancies in which the mother or the fetus has
an increased risk of complications compared to
uncomplicated pregnancies l Besides maternal
death fetal complications e g fetal death
premature delivery low birth weight and other
poor outcomes more likely increase due to
HRP The prevalence ofl IRPs in Iran and other
countries ranges from to In the
past it was not recommended for childbearing
in high risk conditions due to the mother and
baby with more complications Recent advances
in medical treatments have enabled many
women with chronic illnesses to get pregnant
and experience motherhood
Women s risk perception affects decision
making and behavior in pregnancy This
means that mothers must control their
environment diet activity and any risk for
raising their chances of fulfilling the goal of
childbearing A qualitative study of pregnant
women in Iran found that challenges of
family anticipation for motherhood future
pregnancies and challenge of adaptation in
pregnancy were experiences of high risk
pregnant women Many pregnant women with
hypertensive disorders felt that they weren t
well informed of management decisions
and had a desire to be involved in decision
making A study found that thoughts and
feelings about safety the physical environment
and the perceived psychological influence
of the location of birth are the factors that
women consider when deciding on place of
birth process Barriers to management of
diabetes during pregnancy were financial
barriers to maintaining a healthy diet and
exercising communication difficulties lack
of social support and barriers related to
diabetes care ll A grounded theory study has
found becoming the best mom that I can be
is a complex process Women need to rebuild
the self and regain control of their lives This
process needs reorganization of the problem
dealing with their shame and embarrassment
identifying an understanding healthcare
provider and considering the consequences
of the depression and its management A
systematic research finding recommended
that the maternal health experiences should
be highlighted particularly when it comes to
decision making about care
Despite the fact that pregnancy outcome
will be safer with risk management no
qualitative study to investigate management
of risk in high risk pregnant Iranian women
has been conducted in Iran One study
evaluated Risk Management Model of Iran s
Health System According to the Ministry
of Health and Medical Education statistics in
Iran HRPs were cared with standard practice
set by the reference books as a single policy
across Iran HRP management includes
medical interventions and supportive cares
Experiences during HRP have a unique
meaning for the person The researcher s
experience indicates that prenatal care is
carried out based on standards and without
considering the views and opinions of
mothers in Iran Therefore mothers may
not act correctly when the recommendations
and the mother s point of view conflict
which is dangerous for the mother s health
Mother s desire is to preserve the health of
the fetus and herself The experiences and
behaviors of Iranian pregnant women with
regard to the management of HRP remain
mainly unexplored Understanding this matter
and aligning the prenatal care according to
the mother s discretion can be beneficial in
advancing or improving the health of the
mother and the fetus in HRPs The choice
for a qualitative study is its effectiveness in
obtaining the perceptions and experiences and
understanding concerns and feelings of people
with health issues The present qualitative
study was conducted to better understand the
experiences of women with HRP regarding
the management of risk during pregnancy
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current qualitative study which used the
content analysis approach was conducted on
ijcbnm sums ac ir
women with HRPs from July to December
in Mashhad Iran The participants were
selected using a purposeful sampling method of
the women referred to educational hospitals
participant and health centers participant in
Mashhad and the sampling continued until data
saturation The inclusion criteria were Iranian
women with HRP based on the obstetrician s
diagnosis and standard definition of HRP I
outpatient condition willingness to contribute to
their experience and ability to speak Persian and
communicate verbally to provide the researcher
with complete information The exclusion
criteria were congenital fetal abnormalities
during the pregnancy or unwillingness to
continue the study
The data were gathered through in depth
semi structured face to face interviews with
participants until data saturation The
interviews took place in a private and quiet
room in a hospital or healthcare center each
lasting from to minutes The interviews
were conducted by corresponding author
after obtaining informed written consent
Sampling continued until data saturation i e
no new data or new category was acquired
The interview started with general questions
such as
What was your experience of
pregnancy How do you feel during this
pregnancy What have you done during
this
Do you think these actions
are enough What else have you done
differently than other pregnant women
What else have you done to maintain this
pregnancy The interview continued then
with open questions Can you explain more
about the ways you have tried so far to save
this pregnancy and Which medical
recommendations are acceptable to you All
interviews were recorded after the permission
of the participants and obtaining their written
informed consent
The data were analyzed concurrently
with data collection using the conventional
content analysis method as described by Elo
and The analysis consists
of three phases preparing organizing and
IJCBNM January Vol No

reporting In the preparation phase the
researcher corresponding and first author
listened to all of the interviews transcribed
them verbatim and studied the text to gain
an in depth understanding immersion of
the data repeatedly The organization stage
included the selection of meaning units and
codes reduction and compression process of
similar codes appearance of subcategories
and finally the abstraction process to form the
main categories The final list of categories
was formulated with a joint effort by all the
research team members after multiple joint
meetings and agreed upon by all group
members The final stage consisted of
reporting the extracted categories
For data trustworthiness the Lincoln and
Guba method was assessed which
included the four criteria of credibility
dependability
transferability
and
confirmability To ensure the credibility
of the data the researcher thought about it
continuously engagement with the data
The coded texts were made available to
other members of the research team for
validation were also given to participants
and were asked to revise the researcher s
correct understanding of their experiences
member check re interview Data were
evaluated to ensure dependability constantly
To express the transferability information
such as demographic characteristics
interview techniques data collection
methods researcher s observations and the
data analysis process were fully provided in
the present study To achieve confirmability
all stages of the study data collection
and data analysis were continuously
meticulously documented from beginning
to the end For data management the
MaxQDA software version was used
The present research was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Mashhad University

RESULTS
A total of mothers with HRP aged to
years participated in the study The demographic
characteristics of the participants are listed in
Table Analysis of the interviews resulted
in extracted codes and after exclusion of
the duplicate codes a total of main codes
remained These codes were classified into nine
sub categories and three main categories as
shown in Table
l The Excitement of Emotion
l a Feeling Worry and Despair
Worry was the first emotion of most
mothers when facing the risks that they were
going to experience in their pregnancies
Expressing worry and despair depended on
the type of risk factor in mothers as chronic
diseases and the presence of several risk
factors concurrently The possibility of
infertility was a vague concern about the
family consequences added to the worries
about pregnancy
I kept telling myself that it s my problem
we can t have children so I have to bear it
Then I said that the people around me my
mother in law might say after a few years
why you don t have children PS
For some of the participants the problems
encountered in previous pregnancies were
repeated and resulted in poor pregnancy
outcomes the feeling of despair prevailed
over other emotions
Every time I tell myself this time my
pregnancy will be successful but as soon as
my bleeding starts again I tell myself that
I won t get pregnant again I can t do it
anymore how many more times will I have
to get pregnant and will it be futile P

Witnessed action
Childbearing based on discretion in marital life
Resistance to risk acceptance
l b Gladness in the Shadow of Hope and
Optimism
If controlling the risk was possible from the
doctor s point of view physicians permitted
the mothers to get pregnant despite the risk
These mothers tried to regain peace with hope
in God joy with positivity in pregnancy and
peace of mind with a healthy pregnancy
As soon as the doctor allowed me to
get pregnant it was enough for me I left
the gladness behind I believe that in
this pregnancy God got me that so far no
problem has happened so God will care for
me afterwards as well this gives me peace
l c Momentary Shocking and Excitement
If mothers hear stressful news they are
shocked Hearing about the possibility of
not getting pregnant or the threat to the
health of the fetus such as the possibility of
abnormality abortion or death of the fetus
without any background they immediately
had a quick shock reaction
When the doctor said that I can t get
pregnant with myoma and uterine surgery
and they might remove the uterus I just cried
It wasn t my fault I just cried out loud
IJCBNM January Vol No
I d Inactivity and Helplessness
Mothers with chronic diseases and
frequent history of poor outcomes in previous
pregnancies needed more treatments costs
and were exposed to more drug side effects
These repeatable and boring measurements
caused the feeling of fatigue and helplessness
with pregnancy so they did not do anything
else due to the feeling of helplessness in some
stages of treatment
I have to take an injection every day
my body gets hives No matter what I do
the itching doesn t go away it bothers me
I couldn t find the drug sometimes It s very
expensive and now it s still five months
I m really wearied Sometimes I don t do
anything anymore P
Self contemplation
a Active Analysis of the Ways of Moderating
the Risk
Some participants thought about the risk
adjustment methods for themselves Each
mother evaluated the solutions according to
the ability in her personal and family life
My biggest worry is during childbirth I
thought to myself if I can take someone with
me as a companion if I have a caesarean
Khadivzadeh T Shojaeian Z Sahebi A
section if I give birth to my baby painlessly
or whether I can go to the city where I work
where they will know me more
Some mothers used to bear the problems
more easily hoping for the future of pregnancy
and imagining the joys of the child in the
future as one strategy
When my asthma bothers me I think I
will start planning for happiness and a new
life right now and not to be boring for myself
and my husband P II
Some mothers were investigating possible
alternative solutions to reach the desired
number of children
Until now no one told me that I could use
a surrogate I said to myself when I can get
pregnant myself why a surrogate
will definitely look for other methods P
b Cognitive Denial
Some mothers did not believe in the
importance of the risk In their opinion there
was no difference between them and the other
mothers compared themselves with other low
risk mothers They did not need to take more
care
I do the same things as other mothers
who get pregnant I go to the doctor I do the
tests I don t need to do anything else P l
c Ignoring the Risk
Some mothers desired to continue
childbearing despite the risk they comforted
themselves and tried to reduce the risk in their
minds to help themselves and then take action
When I m very worried I say to myself
that there are many pregnant women whose
conditions are much worse than me For
example one of them had had six cesarean
sections so far and nothing happened so
there will be no problem for me either I know
everything myself and should be careful
Some mothers believed that childbearing
was the only way to achieve what they wanted
and there was no other way for them they felt
compelled to get pregnant despite the risk
Therefore the risk does not matter against
the desire
If I hadn t been get pregnant I wouldn t
have been able to do anything else with my
life instead of having a baby My husband
wanted a child and being bothered during
pregnancy is not very important for saving
my life P
Witnessed Action
a Problem focused and Rational Actions
Mothers showed various actions in
encountering to HRPs The practical solution
for many mothers was to try all possible
solutions as using peer experiences relevant
support and alternative solutions Every
mother chose the method that was possible
and effective for her and tried to make it easier
for herself to bear the risk and problems
Before I got pregnant I read a lot about
the pregnancies of other mothers with my
conditions I traveled to another city to be
cared by good specialist doctors This way I
see other mothers in my conditions who got
pregnant and I can ask what they did
Some mothers tolerated the problems
obeyed medical advice and tried to reduce
the risk with methods spiritual solutions
patience family involvement and flexibility
According to their discretion they moderated
the risk and ultimately trusted in God and
were not dissatisfied
I did everything I couldfor this pregnancy
I went to the doctor I did all the screening
tests they said I put my trust in God I prayed
I read the Qur an for her health and thanked
God that it has progressed this far God is
great
Getting pregnant for some mothers such
as heart patients or chronic diseases was
associated with more problems than other
mothers It was to preserve the health of the
fetus and mother In this way they accept
all kinds of hardships and difficulties with
all their soul The health of the fetus was a
priority for these mothers
I didn t have a child no matter what
the doctor recommended I still refused and
became pregnant It is important for me to
keep the child I try to use everything I can
ijcbnm sums ac ir
to reduce my stress I cope with illness and
conditions everyway I take medicine
Ifollow a diet just to give birth to a healthy
child
b Avoidance and Inefficient Engagements
In addition to the thought of ignorance
of the risk some mothers showed avoidance
behavior and inefficient engagements in their
actions They consciously knew that they
should not get pregnant They did not take any
measures to assess the risk before pregnancy
They justified the risk of pregnancy to factors
other than medical issues or avoided going
to the doctor out of fear they did not take
preventive measures
If I wanted to wait for the doctors to give
me permission to get pregnant I didn t know
how long it would take and then they might
say no you shouldn t get pregnant that s why
I didn t go to the doctor before I got pregnant
Even now that I m pregnant when I go to the
doctor I don t ask anything
Some mothers consciously resisted medical
advice advice not to get pregnant They put
the doctor against the fait accompli and got
pregnant They justified that the appropriate
time to have a child with their living conditions
was now or decided to continue childbearing
regardless of the risk until they have desired
number of children
I didn t ask the doctor before I got
pregnant Then I told my doctor my baby is
already big it was time to have another child
and I am pregnant now
DISCUSSION
The main aim of this study was to explain
high risk pregnant mothers experiences from
risk management The results showed that
the mother s feeling was more prominent as
the most significant element of measuring
behavior after being informed about the risks
of pregnancy Mothers who had a poor history
of a previous pregnancy or chronic diseases
such as heart disease or pregnancy with several
risk factors felt more worried and disappointed
IJCBNM January Vol No
Risk management in high risk pregnancy
because they felt more at risk On the other
hand in mothers whose risk factor was less
severe such as age or the risk of pregnancy was
controllable from the mother s point of view at
the same time as worry feelings of happiness
and optimism were more expressed in the
mother The results of another study showed
that pregnancy along with having an unhealthy
and high risk body in diabetic women brought
a sense of lack of control which led to the
feeling of worry and guilt about high blood
glucose levels constant pressure and difficult
interactions with health care professionals
In a systematic review high risk mothers
experienced a wide range of emotions Their
behavior influenced expectations social norms
pregnancy complications fetal abnormalities
and pregnancy related diseases Therefore
shock fear despair sadness isolation and
loneliness anger sadness guilt and mental
health disorders were commonly seen in these
mothers In another study mothers experienced
emotions such as fear anxiety and sadness with
happiness in a HRP Another systematic review
found that the increase or decrease in maternal
happiness during pregnancy was influenced by
factors such as age life with a sexual partner
social support previous pregnancy experience
desired pregnancy and health status
In the present study mothers started self
evaluation after the initial stages of facing
the problem and subsiding the physiological
reactions According to the mothers
perception of personal capabilities and risk
control the thoughts were in the direction
of strengthening positive feelings or denying
the risk and avoiding responsibility Thoughts
of mothers who had a feeling of peace and
hope were in the direction of reducing the
effects of the risk Mothers who felt worried
and helpless blamed themselves and focused
on the obstacles by denying the responsibility
of managing the risk In one study high risk
mothers who had a sense of self efficacy
positively searched for information and in
stressful situations used individual approaches
such as control avoidance and distraction to
stressful information
Khadivzadeh T Shojaeian Z Sahebi A
Our results showed that the next step after
the targeted imagination to overcome the risk
was managing and practical determination of
effective and ineffective behaviors Therefore
the mothers behaviors problem oriented
strategies versus avoidance strategies
were included Actions were being patient
seeking support from relevant trusting
in God and imams controlling stressors
versus shirking responsibility refusing to
take preventive measures and trying to get
pregnant without paying attention to the risk
factor The methods or strategies a person
uses to overcome stressful situations play an
important role in his her mental health In a
study difference in behavior during pregnancy
was caused by differences in cultures In
another study literacy income and education
were efficient on health behavior Strategies
used by women with phenylketonuria in
one study included seeking knowledge and
support learning skills coping strategies
with evaluation and reassuring to minimize
harm to the fetus In one study the mothers
choices depended on perceived risk severity
judgment and beliefs about risks of pregnancy
and childbirth mother s weighting of various
influencing factors and prioritizing and
balancing the risk factors The interpretation
of safety and risk was different in mothers
who chose home birth or hospital birth but
the goal of both groups was the health and
well being of the fetus In a review studyr
researchers found that the behavior of mothers
during pregnancy was influenced by values
beliefs perceived risk priorities and different
capabilities the way to collect information
and examine them The main theme of all
mothers behaviors during pregnancy was
maternal and fetal health All mothers were
trying to fulfill the pregnancy in a way that
would ensure maternal and fetal health and
that care and problems during pregnancy
would not prevent them from satisfying other
personal and family needs
As a limitation of this study the purposeful
sample method and enrolment of volunteered
participants might have been a selection
bias Another limitation was that the care
providers did not participate in the study
The strengths of this study are the use of a
qualitative approach and that the study is the
first to explore Iranian pregnant women s
experiences of risk management during a
HRP We recruited the participants with
maximum variation sampling e g mothers
with different risk factors throughout
pregnancy
CONCLUSION
Risk management experiences of pregnant
women within HRPs include a wide range of
positive and negative feelings effective and
ineffective thoughts and behaviors ofthe mother
Mothers who faced several risk factors or chronic
diseases during pregnancy felt helpless focused
on the obstacles to having a healthy child and
avoided responsibility and effective behaviors
On the other hand tirelessness and efforts to use
all possible solutions and risk management to
achieve the goals were the characteristics of the
mothers who with positive thinking and belief
in the ability to manage risk and using available
resources tried to bring their pregnancy to
fruition despite the risk The pregnant mothers
desire to choose the best approach for both the
child s health and their well being is based
on their assessment of the pregnancy risks
Mutual collaboration between mothers and
midwives obstetricians can lead to choosing
effective risk management strategies Further
studies on midwives and obstetricians about risk
management in pregnancy are recommended

Abstract
Background Computerized clinical decision support CDSS digital information systems designed to improve
clinical decision making by providers is a promising tool for improving quality of care This study aims to
understand the uptake of ASMAN application defined as completeness of electronic case sheets the role of CDSS
in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery outcomes
Methods We have conducted secondary analysis of program data government data collected from public
facilities across four districts each in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan The data collected between
August October baseline and the data collected between December March latest was
analysed The data sources included digitized labour room registers case sheets referral and discharge summary
forms observation checklist and complication format Descriptive univariate and multivariate and interrupted time
series regression analyses were conducted
Results The completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period and in facilities with
more than deliveries a month In multivariate logistic regression analysis the introduction of technology
yielded significant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices We have observed reduction in fresh still
births rates and asphyxia but these results were not statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
However our analysis showed that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of
program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased
Conclusions Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care and delivery
outcome Future studies with rigorous study design is required to understand the impact of technology in
improving quality of maternity care

Introduction
Globally it has been proven that effective and quality of
care at the facility level particularly around childbirth
and immediately after the birth can significantly con
tribute to the reduction of maternal deaths stillbirths
and neonatal deaths Over the last decades efforts
in ensuring skilled birth attendance resulted in increased
institutional deliveries this in turn moved higher pro
portion of avoidable maternal and neonatal mortality to
health facilities Therefore improving quality of care
around childbirth and immediately after birth is impera
tive to prevent adverse outcomes for pregnant women
and new borns
In India despite a tremendous increase in rate of insti
tutional deliveries maternal and neonatal deaths did
not show equivalent reduction in the last decade It
was found by few studies that the increase in the rate of
institutional deliveries was not matched with overall im
provement in quality of maternity care Quality of
care is a multi dimensional concept that incudes avail
ability of evidence based guidelines strengthened infra
structure resources enabling environment attitude of
health providers all these in turn result in patients and
providers satisfaction and improved health outcomes
To address these issues the Government of India
Gol launched the quality improvement initiative under
the name Dakshata means adroitness to build pro
vider adherence to key evidence based clinical practices
during intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods
Dakshata uses the World Health Organization s Safe
Childbirth Checklist SCC as a framework for
improving providers competency Although Dakshata
intervention has not been evaluated other quality of
intrapartum care improvement initiatives using SCC in
Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka
demonstrated significant improvement in adherence to
evidence based clinical practices Moreover a study from
Rajasthan showed reduction in perinatal mortality
which fell by However these studies detected
certain clinical practices that either did not improve sig
nificantly initiation of partograph counselling on dan
ger signs or declined over months period use of
SCC administration of oxytocin soon after delivery
Thus it is imperative to identify and test innovative so
lutions for improving quality of care in order to acceler
ate reduction in maternal and neonatal death in India
One such solution is computerized clinical decision sup
port CDSS digital information systems designed to
improve clinical decision making by providers a prom
ising tool for improving quality of care by improving ad
herence to clinical guidelines practitioner s
performance patient outcomes and
quality of clinical documentation thus contributing
to quality improvement and overall efficiency of health
Page of
care delivery While there is significant research on
CDSSs generally but evidence of use of CDSS for mater
nity care is limited In rural health facilities in Burkina
Faso Ghana and Tanzania CDSS was not found to sig
nificantly improve quality of antenatal and delivery care
A study conducted in South Africa showed that
CDSS lead to overall improvement in adherence to clin
ical guidelines but it was not statistically significant
In Nigeria McNabb et al reported that decision support
via mobile phones led to significant improvement in
health counselling technical services quality of health
education and patient satisfaction
ASMAN intervention
In this paper we describe the findings from implementa
tion of ASMAN The Alliance for Saving Mothers and
Newborns a provider focused package of interventions
that leverages technology to reduce maternal and early
neonatal mortality through the adoption of key tech
nologies that improve capacity building and service de
livery efforts focused on the provision of quality care
during childbirth and the first h after delivery
The ASMAN project takes an integrated quality im
provement approach
Competency building through provision of
training for Medical Officers MOs Staff Nurses
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife ANM on clinical skills
and quality of care as per the established labour
room protocols and standards For this purpose the
project adopted Gol approved Dakshata training
package for building the capacity of service
providers Post training follow up and on site men
toring were conducted by the program team to en
sure translation of skills into practice
Introduction of technology intervention to facilitate
timely and correct clinical decision making by pro
viders For this purpose ASMAN an android based
application for electronic recording of intrapartum
and immediate postpartum care integrated with
Clinical Decision Support e partograph knowledge
enhancement and other features was introduced at
project sites The ASMAN application runs on a
tablet stationed in several important areas of the
health facilities including registration triage the
labor room postpartum areas operation theatre
and post operative wards
The ASMAN application had the following
components
Case management Digitized case sheet from
admission until discharge with integrated clinical
rules admission notes e partogram Safe Childbirth

remote support center have access to all cases
ASMAN program implementation took place across
public facilities in four districts each in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh states of India The key stakeholders of
ASMAN were Governments of Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan This project was piloted between June
to May with support from Reliance Foundation
Tata Trusts MSD for Mothers Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and United States Agency for International
Development USAID Jhpiego was the lead implemen
tation agency The respective state governments were
consulted to select specific intervention districts that
had higher neonatal and maternal mortality rates as
compared to the state average districts without ongoing
intervention for improving quality of intrapartum and
postpartum care Within those districts government
health facilities that had a relatively high case load of
or more deliveries per month and therefore greater need
for intervention were selected
This program implementation offered an opportunity
to evaluate the role of a CDSS in improving quality of
care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum
periods assess its impact on delivery outcomes identifi
cation and referral of key maternal and neonatal compli
cations in selected public facilities
Methodology
Research aims
To our knowledge no studies from India have described
the impact of CDSS on clinical outcomes during the
intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods Along
with the lack of evidence on effect of CDSS in improving
quality of maternity care this gap represents a crucial
Page of
research priority for India with global relevance
Through this analysis we attempt to answer the follow
ing questions
What was the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers
How did the ASMAN application affect adherence
to key clinical practices
What was the trend of maternal pre eclampsia
eclampsia postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal
fresh still births birth asphyxia complications
during the project implementation
What was the trend of identification and referral of
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
postpartum haemorrhage during the project
implementation
Study design and study setting
We have conducted secondary analysis of program data
government data collected from public facilities
across four districts each in two states of Madhya
Pradesh Jabalpur Khargone Ratlam and Vidisha and
Rajasthan Ajmer Bhilwara Kota and Jhalawar This
de identified dataset was provided by the government of
both states The data collected between August Octo
ber was considered as a baseline and the data
collected between December March was
considered as a latest assessment The study was per
formed in accordance with ethical principles outlined in
the World Medical Association W MA Declaration of
Helsinki where privacy and confidentiality of per
sonal information was assured by getting access to de
identified data
Study tools and data collection
The following tools were used to collect data
ASMAN application data has digitized all labour
room registers case sheets referral and discharge
summary forms of Government of India Every
woman who comes to any ASMAN facility for
delivery is registered in the application All forms
are filled by the health providers at the project
facilities in real time Details from patient history
labour room case sheets partograph until
discharge is collected in the ASMAN application
We have used data from ASMAN application to
understand filling ratio at admission delivery
post delivery postnatal care PNC and discharge
Data of all those women who had delivered at
ASMAN facilities and their newborns between
November and March in Rajasthan
and Madhya Pradesh states are used for this ana
lysis Till March data of women
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
who delivered and newborns were en
tered in ASMAN application
The observation checklist was developed based on
WHO SCC and was approved by GOI as part of
monitoring activities under Dakshata program
This checklist was designed to measure adherence
to essential practices around childbirth These
practices were divided by pause points practices
that are necessary to perform on admission just
before pushing or before caesarean soon after
birth h and before discharge This tool was used
to explore adherence to practices at the baseline and
latest assessment periods The program officers
with medical background collected this information
the observation assessment on average took h
Complication format Maternal and New Born
Complications Identification and Referral
Monitoring System Since there is no formal
mechanism in the government systems to monitor
childbirth and new born related complication and
management complication format was introduced
by ASMAN program team with the support from
the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
The complication reporting format captured data on
key maternal and newborn health indicators from
the labour room postpartum ward Sick Newborn
Care Unit SNCU admissions and discharge
department of the facility This format captured data
on total deliveries type of deliveries fresh stillbirths
preterm births maternal and neonatal death
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
sepsis postpartum haemorrhage sepsis neonatal
complications neonatal asphyxia and sepsis refer
in and refer out data for maternal and neonatal
complications One nodal person preferably a
labour room staff was selected from each
intervention facility to act as the key contact person
for this initiative and was validated regularly by
ASMAN program team This tool was used to
explore effect of ASMAN application on delivery
outcomes
Data analysis
To describe uptake of ASMAN application we com
puted the filling rates of key data fields of the applica
tion and analysed the differences by pause points level
of health facility and average annual delivery load at the
health facilities
To analyze the change in adherence to evidence based
practices after roll out of the intervention we combined
the baseline assessment and last periodic assessment
data sets For overall univariate analysis of adherence to
key clinical practices before and after comparison we
computed means for before and latest intervention
Page of
periods and compared them using chi square test For
adherence to evidence based practices we also per
formed multivariable logistic regression analysis for each
practice while adjusting for level of facility average de
livery load at the facility and availability of resources re
quired for each key practice
To analyze trends in maternal and neonatal complica
tions and referrals we utilized the monthly complication
format data which was shared by all ASMAN interven
tion facilities As the intervention was rolled out in a
staggered manner at different time points across project
health facilities we categorized the complication data of
each facility into two time periods corresponding to be
fore and after intervention roll out
Within each time period we further grouped monthly
data into quarterly data months data such that each
quarter represented a time interval relative to the inter
vention roll out For example Q and Q denoted
the periods corresponding to months before and
months after intervention rollout respectively The
month of intervention roll out together with subsequent
months were denoted as QO or quarter O or the time
interval corresponding to intervention roll out Data of
corresponding quarters was combined for all facilities
and this dataset was used for generating simple time
series plots line bar for analysing the trends before and
after intervention roll out
Single group interrupted time series regression analysis
was performed on two dependent variables fresh still
birth rate and incidence of neonatal asphyxia We
have conducted interrupted time series analysis for these
two outcomes as these were primary outcomes of the
intervention Monthly data was utilized for carrying out
this analysis yielding data for time points before and
after intervention roll out respectively M to M
before roll out and M to M after roll out Coef
ficients or parameters which represented a shift in the
level intercept of the dependent variable and a shift in
the rate of change slope of dependent variable after
intervention were computed along with confidence
intervals Newey west standard errors were utilized to
account for autocorrelation
For all statistical tests of significance p value
was considered significant We used Statistics package
for the Social Sciences SPSS version Stata version
and Microsoft Excel for data analysis

Discussion
Our study described the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers the role of ASMAN appli
cation in improving adherence to key clinical practices
delivery outcomes and maternal complications We have
observed that introducing ASMAN application resulted
in statistically significant improvements in adherence to
key clinical practices However overall completeness of
case sheets in ASMAN application was low across all
levels of facilities We have observed reduction in fresh

still birth rates and asphyxia but these results were not
statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
On the other hand our analysis showed that identifica
tion of maternal complications has increased over the
period of program implementation and at the same time
referral outs decreased
Uptake of ASMAN application
We have included completeness of case sheets in appli
cation as a measure of data quality as it is a commonly
assessed dimension of data quality mentioned in a re
view Although using medical records has been
criticized for measuring quality of record keeping prac
tices instead of quality of care it was argued that patient
case records should be part of quality of care assessment
because individual case records are essential not only for
case management and peer review but also for assessing
the impact of health interventions Additionally it
was noted that clinical record keeping enables continuity
of care and improves communication between different
health providers
Fig Trend of neonata
Our results indicated that the filling ratio during the
post partum period was low across all type of facilities
The poor clinical documentation was reported in a re
view of obstetric records conducted in India with
the extent of documentation varying between as
sessment of mother s condition at the discharge and
admission date Similarly a multicenter retro
spective review of clinical records of cesarean delivery in
five low income countries identified poor quality record
keeping with missing information on key events man
agement of complications and delivery outcomes
Furthermore we have found that the filling ratio across
all pause points was low at the district hospital level and
high delivery load facilities In our qualitative study
health care providers mentioned that staff shortage pa
tient urgency high caseloads prevented staff to complete
all fields in the application According to a study
conducted by Chaturvedi and colleagues Madhya
Pradesh state of India documentation was better at dis
trict hospitals due to higher qualification of the staff in
those facilities and availability of forms at the district
hospitals Although the present study did not conduct

more it was noted by the same study that the data
captured electronically was easily available to providers
compare to paper based records Understanding the rea
sons for the low filling ratios at the PNC period would
require further research The low filling ratio at facilities
with delivery load more than could be explained by
bigger client provider ratio could be reasons as per an
ecdotal experience
Adherence to key clinical practices
Our study revealed that quality of care across all pause
points improved during the implementation of ASMAN
application Furthermore labor room staff in the
qualitative study mentioned that ASMAN application
improved their ability to take a complete history and
physical exam identify high risk patients manage cases
confidently facilitate provider communication improve
reporting processes and ensure continuity of care for re
ferral patients In our study we have observed that
examinations around identification and management of
complications initiation of partograph identification of
post partum haemorrhage increased significantly These
results indicate that ASMAN application has the poten
tial to improve quality of care provided around the
childbirth These are very encouraging results as timely
identification of complications is crucial because over a
third of maternal deaths a significant proportion of
pregnancy related life threatening conditions approxi
mately half of all stillbirths and a quarter of neonatal
deaths are attributed to complications that occur during
labour childbirth or the immediate postpartum period
Our findings are in line with the results of three
systematic reviews on the role of CDSS use on providers
adherence to clinical practices According to

Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Garg and colleagues better performance of pro
viders was observed in studies where users were auto
matically prompted to use the systems compared with
studies in which users were required to actively initi
ate the system Additionally the same review ob
served better performance in studies in which the
trial authors also developed the CDSS software
Moreover a synthesis of high quality systematic re
views showed that the positive effect of CDSS
depends on the services which it was used CDSS
positively impacted providers performance in studies
on drugs ordering and preventive care measures
Kawamoto et al identified four features strongly
associated with a decision support system s ability to
improve clinical practice a decision support pro
vided automatically as part of clinician workflow b
decision support delivered at the time and location of
decision making c actionable recommendations pro
vided and d computer based Additionally CDSS
should also provide periodic performance feedback
request documentation of the reason for not following
system recommendations and share decision support
results with patients
While there are studies on benefits of CDSS in general
there is very limited research on benefits of CDCC in
maternity care Duysburgh et al did not find a sig
nificant improvement in quality of antenatal and delivery
care with the use of CDSS assessed in Burkina Faso
Ghana and Tanzania They have concluded that history
taking counselling health education laboratory investi
gations and examination and monitoring of mothers
and newborns during childbirth were not performed ac
cording to the standards A study conducted in South
Africa for improving compliance of health care workers
with antenatal care guidelines found overall improve
ment but it was not statistically significant
McNabb et al reports significant improvement in health
counselling technical services quality of health educa
tion and patient satisfaction as a result of a mobile
phone decision support during antenatal care in Nigeria
Furthermore studies conducted in India on the role of
CDSS in the management of cardiovascular diseases
and hypertension demonstrated positive role of
CDSS in improving care adherence to guidelines coun
selling and follow up with patients that resulted in blood
pressure reduction
Delivery outcomes and maternal complications
Improved practices around childbirth have a potential to
prevent birth asphyxia and complications due to prema
turity which are some of the main causes of fresh still
births and early neonatal deaths Our results
revealed that there was a significant decrease in fresh
Page of
still birth and asphyxia however this decrease wasn t sta
tistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
These results are in line with the global evidence on the
lack of evidence of potential impact of CDSS on patient
outcomes Thus according to the sys
tematic review majority of the studies assessed patient
outcomes often without adequate statistical power to de
tect clinically important differences Jaspers and col
leagues found only few studies on impact of CDSS on
patient outcomes though many of these have been too
small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinic
ally important effect Furthermore a systematic re
view and meta analysis found that CDSS linked to
electronic health records did not detect statistically sig
nificant reduction in morbidity and mortality
The lack of statistically significant improvement in de
livery outcomes could be attributed to the small sample
size and short follow up periods which is not long
enough to assess the impact of CDSS on patient out
comes
During the course of the program implementation
we have observed that identification of pre eclampsia
is increased while referrals for the same conditions
decreased This change could be attributed to the
improved assessment at the time of admission
Moreover we have observed the same trend in iden
tification and referral of postpartum hemorrhage that
could be explained by increased administration of
oxytocin within min of delivery
Strengths and limitations
The results of our study contributes to the dearth of lit
erature on the role of CDSS in maternity care From the
onset of the program our team trained and worked
closely with the focal point in each facility to ensure
quality of data and timely reporting Furthermore as a
part of program implementation all providers were
trained in distinguishing and reporting fresh still births
Additionally data reported from facilities were regularly
validated by our team The availability of data before
and during the program implementation allowed us to
estimate the role of CDSS in improving quality of intra
partum care and delivery outcomes Our study has few
limitations Firstly it is possible that providers carried
out the patient management according to the standards
but didn t record it in application Secondly our assess
ment involved direct observation of provider practices
as a result potential Hawthorne effect would have hap
pened To minimize Hawthorne effect we trained our
project officers using standard observation checklist and
standard operating procedures Lastly due to utilization
of program data in our analysis establishing causal claim
is limited
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Conclusion
To our knowledge this is the first study that provides
and evidence on the role of technology to improve the
quality of intrapartum care and delivery outcomes in
India However the results of this study could be gener
alized to another country with similar settings Our
study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality
of intrapartum care and delivery outcome Future studies
with rigorous study design are required to understand
the impact of technology in improving quality of mater
nity care These studies could provide evidence on redu
cing the burden of maternal and neonatal death
attributable to inadequate quality of care in India and
globally

Associations between pre pregnancy psychosocial risk
factors and infant outcomes a population based cohort
study in England
Katie Harron Ruth Gilbert Jamie Fagg Astrid Guttmann Jan van der Meulen
Summary
Background Existing studies evaluating the association between maternal risk factors and specific infant outcomes such
as birthweight injury admissions and mortality have mostly focused on single risk factors We aimed to identify
routinely recorded psychosocial characteristics of pregnant women most at risk of adverse infant outcomes to inform
targeting of early intervention
Methods We created a cohort using administrative hospital data Hospital Episode Statistics for all births to mothers
aged years in England UK who gave birth on or after April and who were discharged before or on
March We used generalised linear models to evaluate associations between psychosocial risk factors recorded
in hospital records in the years before the week of pregnancy ie teenage motherhood deprivation pre
pregnancy hospital admissions for mental health or behavioural conditions and pre pregnancy hospital admissions
for adversity including drug or alcohol abuse violence and self harm and infant outcomes ie birthweight
unplanned admission for injury or death from any cause within months from postnatal discharge
Findings Of births initially assessed were eligible and were included in the birth outcome analysis
Among the eligible births were births to teenage mothers age years were births to
previous teenage mothers were births to mothers who had a history of hospital admissions for mental

Introduction
Psychosocial factors in pregnant women that are not
addressed can have adverse effects on outcomes of preg
nancy for both mothers and their infants l Guidelines
from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
recommend that women with complex social risk factors
should be identified during pregnancy so that additional
support can be provided These guidelines recognise
that vulnerable women often experience a range of
social risk factors simultaneously and highlight the
specific needs of teenage mothers aged years women
who misuse substances and women who experience
domestic violence
Targeted support for women before and during preg
nancy has the potential to improve outcomes at and after
birth through promoting preconception health and

reproductive choices and mitigating the adverse effects of
maternal stress Postnatal support can positively affect
the quality of caregiving and child attachment and the
development and behaviour of the child furthermore it
can mitigate the effects of adversity and reduce the risk of
unmet medical need or child injury Appropriate early
intervention can therefore lead to improved maternal and
neonatal outcomes and health education and social
outcomes throughout childhood
In England maternity services and primary care
during and after pregnancy are universal and freely
available for the approximately births per year
with home visiting support delivered through the
Healthy Child Programme g The frequency of home
visits and contact varies according to a proportionate
universalism model meaning that whereas support is

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies published in English between
Jan and May using the MeSH terms
pregnancy outcome birthweight infant mortality OR
infant newborn AND maternal age adolescence parity
social class substance related disorders violence OR
mental disorders We reviewed studies from high income
countries that addressed maternal risk factors before and
during pregnancy in relation to birth outcomes or infant
hospital admissions or mortality Previous cohort and
administrative data longitudinal studies have examined the
association between young maternal age and parity and
specific maternal or infant health outcomes and they have
found that young maternal age is associated with low
birthweight preterm birth and increased health care use
throughout childhood Population based cohorts also report
links between poor maternal mental health during pregnancy
and low birthweight or preterm birth and between poor
maternal mental health during pregnancy and injury and
respiratory symptoms in children Other studies have found
increased risks of infant morbidity and mortality or poor child
development associated with risky behaviours of the mother
recorded during pregnancy including smoking drug or alcohol
misuse or poor diet mother exposure to intimate partner
violence maternal mental health or lack of antenatal care
Many studies have also highlighted disparities for those with
lower versus higher social status and differences in risk of
adverse infant and child health outcomes by ethnicity race or
Aboriginal status Most studies focused on single risk factors
we did not find any studies using population based
administrative data to quantify the association of multiple
psychosocial risk factors that are routinely recorded by health
services before or during pregnancy and infant birthweight
injury admissions and mortality
Added value of this study
This population based cohort study examined data from more
than million mother baby pairs in National Health Service
hospitals in England UK over years This study showed that
pre pregnancy psychosocial risk factors routinely recorded in
universal scale and intensity is proportionate to the level
of need and disadvantage g In practice groups who
stand to benefit from additional support ie for whom
early intervention might be effective are identified as
those likely to experience adverse health outcomes
Previous evidence has identified associations between
poor birth and infant outcomes and risk factors that
are routinely recorded in hospital records such as
young maternal age parity risky behaviours including
smoking drug or alcohol misuse or poor diet exposure
to intimate partner violence maternal mental health
and poor engagement with antenatal care services
Routine hospital records can be used to identify
psychosocial risk factors and their influence on child
hospitalisation records before weeks of pregnancy
ie previous birth before years of age hospital contacts
related to adversity or mental health or behavioural conditions
and deprivation were associated with substantially increased
risks of low birthweight preterm birth injury and death during
the months from postnatal discharge Maternal age of less
than years for the current or previous birth was an important
risk factor but hospitalisations before pregnancy for drug or
alcohol abuse self harm or violence or for mental health or
behavioural conditions were also important irrespective of
maternal age These groups could potentially benefit from
health and social interventions before and during pregnancy
Implications of all the available evidence
This research shows a need for effective interventions before
during and after pregnancy to reduce the downstream burden
on health services and prevent long term adverse effects for
children including low birthweight unplanned admission for
injury and mortality In addition to the of mothers who
were teenagers at the current or a previous birth we found that
the of women aged years who could be routinely
identified from hospital data before pregnancy as having a
history of admission to hospital for adversity or mental health or
behavioural conditions also had poor birth and infant outcomes
as did those living in the most deprived population quintile
Improved data collection sharing and linkage across multiple
data sources and efforts across primary and secondary care to
respond to psychosocial risk factors in women using health care
especially among maternity and health visiting services
could improve support for women before during and after
pregnancy and potentially reduce adverse outcomes
More research is needed to develop effective interventions for
women with different risk factors Given the disparities in
outcomes across quintiles of deprivation ie poorer outcomes
for the of births to women living in the most deprived
areas strategies to address the root causes of social
disadvantage are also required Our findings apply to England
but could be generalisable to other countries with similar
maternal risk factors
However most previous studies focused
outcomes
on single risk factors and there is a gap in the evidence
on which of these risk factors when considered
together are associated with the highest risk There is
an absence of studies using routine records to explore
multiple psychosocial risk factors across maternal age
groups before and during early pregnancy
Understanding which women are most vulnerable and
how to identify them in time for intervention is the first
step to the effective development and targeting of early
health and social support programmes This study used
population based hospital data to evaluate the association
between multiple maternal psychosocial risk factors
that can be identified routinely and early in pregnancy

Methods
Study design and participants
This study is a population based cohort study in England
Hospital records were obtained from Hospital Episode
Statistics HES an administrative database holding
detailed information for all admissions to the National
Health Service hospitals in England Admission records
allow the entry of up to fields of clinical diagnoses
coded using the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems Revision
ICD IO
The study population consisted of a cohort of mother
baby pairs which was created by probabilistic linkage of
deliveries and livebirths within HES We included
mother baby pairs when births were singleton births
mothers were aged years at delivery delivery
occurred on or after April and discharge
happened before and on March We excluded the
small number of births to mothers aged years and
older because adverse outcomes for this group might
relate to biological age rather than the social risk factors
and these age related risk factors are less likely to be
amenable to intervention We excluded births to mothers
younger than years because of the small numbers For
mothers with multiple deliveries during the study period
we used a random number generator to select one
mother baby pair for inclusion in analyses to avoid
clustering of outcomes within mothers We did not
restrict analyses to the first child so that we could
consider parity and so that our findings would be more
widely generalisable Approvals for the use of HES data
were obtained as part of the standard Hospital Episode
Statistics approval process and ethical approval was
obtained from London South East Research Ethics
Committee reference LO HES records were
made available by NHS Digital
Outcomes
We chose outcomes that might be amenable to support
for women before during or after pregnancy and that
align with the priorities of English National Health
Service antenatal care and the Healthy Child Pro
gramme First we described birthweight because
low birthweight is a predictor of substantial morbidity
Birthweight was modelled as a continuous variable and
babies born weighing less than g were categorised
as having low birthweight We also described gestational
age based on best estimates from menstrual dates or
www thelancet com public health February
Articles
ultrasound and size for gestation at birth These
variables were derived from maternity fields in infant or
mother HES records We then evaluated the number of
infants with one or more unplanned hospital admissions
for injury within months from postnatal discharge
Reducing hospital admissions and accidents is a high
impact area of the Healthy Child Programme and
th come is considered to be amenable to change
through postnatal support delivered by health visitors
Admissions were defined as unplanned on the basis of
the method of admission code ie excluding elective
admissions and comprised episodes of care in any
hospital captured within the HES data starting more
than days after the end of the birth episode We used
published lists of ICD IO diagnosis codes to identify
admissions for injury appendix pp Finally we see Online for appendix
measured infant mortality in the months following
postnatal discharge referred to as post discharge
mortality We evaluated these infant outcomes from
postnatal discharge rather than birth to reflect events at
home in the care of parents and to allow for different
lengths of stay during the birth or delivery admission
Risk factors
We pre specified a number of psychosocial risk factors
on the basis of the guidelines for antenatal care for
women with complex social needs namely teenage
motherhood ie mothers aged years at delivery
previous teenage motherhood ie mothers aged years
or older at delivery with a previous birth when aged
years history of adversity related admissions
for violence substance misuse or self harm history of
admissions for mental health or behavioural conditions
excluding self harm and living in areas of high
deprivation
To define histories of adversity or histories of mental
health or behavioural conditions we examined hospital
admission records in the years before the mothers
week of pregnancy We chose weeks on the basis of
recommendations that nearly all women have their
first antenatal contact usually a booking appointment
before this time Guidelines recommend that women
are examined by weeks of pregnancy but the first
examination is often later for women with risk factors
approximately of all women are seen by weeks of
gestation Although recording of these risk factors might
also occur after weeks of pregnancy we aimed to define
risk factors that could be identified early in pregnancy We
used a year look back period for hospital admissions
because this period before birth is likely to have effects on
outcomes and should be in the patient records or could be
asked about by clinicians We also examined the number
of women identified as having a history of mental health
conditions or adversity within year and within years
before the weeks of pregnancy We identified previous
admissions for adversity violence substance misuse
self harm or mental health or behavioural conditions
Articles
on the basis of published lists of ICD IO diagnosis codes
appendix pp We chose to categorise self harm
within the adversity category because it is a behaviour or
event which can be a manifestation of a mental health
condition and to align with previous literature
Quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation were derived
from the national distribution of the Index of Multiple
Deprivation on the basis of the postcode of residence
at delivery Areas of high deprivation were defined
as those within the most deprived quintile We also
described parity and ethnicity Mothers were classified as
primiparous if the number of previous pregnancies
recorded on the maternity record was zero unless we
found a previous delivery for the mother present in HES
records from onwards Previous teenage birth
was defined according to age at first birth recorded in
HES a small proportion of mothers might have been
misclassified if they had their first birth before
ie IO years before the study period or before entering
the HES cohort eg immigrant mothers Ethnic group
was derived from the maternal record
Statistical analysis
Because this study was a population based study no
sample size calculation was done We first calculated the
number of women experiencing each risk factor and the
association between risk factors and maternal age group
We then used generalised linear models to estimate
the association between individual year of maternal
age psychosocial risk factors and outcomes using
Schoenberg B splines for age to allow for a non linear
effect This approach is based on a set of reference
points or knots with the number of points chosen to
balance smoothness and goodness of fit To avoid
overfitting in such a large study cohort we present
results from models with a minimal number of a priori
reference points at ages and years Results
are presented graphically with interactions for each
maternal risk factor These plots do not present mortality
and previous teenage birth because of the low numbers
For unplanned admissions for injury and post discharge
infant mortality but not birthweight we excluded
mother baby pairs in which the baby would not have
been exposed to the mother after the birth episode ie
those discharged to social services or not surviving to
postnatal discharge appendix p
To quantify the risk of adverse outcomes for women with
each psychosocial risk factor we derived risk differences
from generalised linear models with a log link and relative
risks from generalised linear models with an identity link
comparing women with each risk factor to women without
that risk factor We derived adjusted estimates to help
understand how much of the associations were explained
by concurrent risk factors Adjusted models for birthweight
included all psychosocial risk factors defined previously
plus maternal age years
whereby the year age group combines the two year
groups because of the low numbers ethnicity and parity
Models for unplanned admission for injury counted
infants who had died from any cause after postnatal
discharge as having the outcome because death was a
competing risk for admission All models used robust
standard errors to allow for clustering of women within
hospitals On the basis of these adjusted models we
derived population attributable fractions PAFs to
quantify the percentage of outcomes in the study
population attributable to each risk factor
We used multiple imputation with chained equations
for missing values of birthweight gestational
age and deprivation O The imputation
models included birthweight gestational age quintile of
deprivation delivery by caesarean section pregnancy or
delivery and neonatal risk factors identified from ICD IO
codes appendix p ethnic group parity infant sex
maternal age and psychosocial risk factors previous
teenage motherhood history of adversity history of
mental health or behavioural conditions we used five
imputations A complete case analysis was done as a
sensitivity analysis In both analyses unknown or
missing ethnicity was treated as a separate category
Analyses were done in Stata

Discussion
Our population based cohort study fills an evidence
gap by examining which women should be considered at
high risk for adverse birth and infant outcomes on the
basis of multiple psychosocial risk factors recorded
routinely in hospital records during or before pregnancy
All of the psychosocial risk factors current or previous
teenage birth a history of adversity or mental health or
behavioural conditions or living in the most deprived
areas were associated with the adverse infant outcomes
of low birthweight unplanned admission for injury and
post discharge mortality The effect of these risk factors
was consistently high across all maternal age groups
Overall of women had at least one risk factor and
although teenage mothers were at highest risk of poor
infant outcomes the majority of women with at
least one risk factor were older than years at delivery
A major strength of our study is that we considered
multiple psychosocial risk factors and outcomes using
national data linking over million delivery and birth
records Without this linkage it would not have been
possible to evaluate how maternal exposures before
pregnancy influence infant outcomes A further
strength is that outcomes were based on national policy
priorities and that effect sizes were similar to those for
other well recognised risk factors for poor infant
outcomes For example the crude risk differences in
birthweight observed in this study were similar to those
seen when comparing smoking and non smoking
mothers g and relative risks were comparable

injuries By considering and adjusting for a range
of psychosocial risk factors within a national cohort
our study fills a gap in evidence on which factors are
associated with the greatest population attributable risk
Our study was limited by definitions of mental health
or behavioural conditions and adversity that were based
on hospital data we only captured cases that were severe
enough to be recorded in a hospital admission record
However we included up to diagnostic codes and
so would have captured admissions related to these
conditions even when these conditions were not the
primary cause of admission We did not have information
on smoking or body mass index on the amount of
support families received eg number of home visits by
midwives or health visitors participation in the Family
Nurse Partnership FNP teenage pregnancy units and
housing or other services or on childhood developmental
outcomes However only up to a quarter of the of
first time teenage mothers in our study would have
received FNP during this period and any benefits of this
intervention are likely to have led to an underestimation
of the effects of psychosocial risk factors We did not
capture stillbirths or miscarriages which might also
have underestimated the effect of psychosocial risk
factors Our study included only singleton births and
we excluded mothers either younger than years or
older than years Future research could consider other
relevant outcomes eg presentations to emergency
departments and explore associations for the of
births to mothers with multiple deliveries during the
study period which were excluded in this study
Evaluating regional variation in risk factors and outcomes
could also be informative for policy Our findings apply
to England but could be generalisable to other countries
with similar maternal risk factors
Proportionate universalism the resourcing and
delivering of services that are universal but have a scale
and intensity proportionate to the level of disadvantage
is key to reducing health inequalities For this strategy to
work effectively susceptible groups need to be identified
early on the basis of disease burden or determinants of
health We show that routine hospital data can inform
www thelancet com public health February
Maternal age years
Figure Crude unadjusted association between maternal age and infant
mortality in the months from postnatal discharge
who to target and provide an approach for quantifying the
numbers of women at high risk Presentations to
hospital for emergency care for mental health or
behavioural conditions or adversity before weeks of
pregnancy provide important opportunities for
interventions before pregnancy including support for
reproductive choice eg ensuring timely access to
contraception and preconception health to improve
birth outcomes Such presentations during and after
pregnancy should also prompt emergency care services to
involve primary care and other community services to
support the mother and child to improve child outcomes
for example through access to mental health care or
intensive home visiting to build parenting capacity
ensure child safety mitigate the effects of adversity and
help prepare for subsequent pregnancies However
providing a universal service remains important for
identifying women with needs not meeting thresholds for
admission Improved data collection and completeness of
risk factor recording during antenatal visits and health
visiting contacts and improved data sharing and linkage
across health social care and education services could
support antenatal and health visiting services in making
Articles
judgements for individual families and strengthen
referral pathways between community and health care
services Such linkage would also facilitate research on
uptake and the wider societal benefits and costs of early
interventions and the opportunity costs of increased
targeting schemes in terms of diverting services from the
universal model
A further requirement for proportionate universalism
is effective interventions Interventions and specialised
services that are offered to women vary across England
The FNP which is targeted at first time teenage mothers
is one of the only programmes specifically recommended
within the Healthy Child Programme g However the
FNP only targets first time teenage mothers of
this study population whereas the highest risk of low
birthweight and preterm birth in our study was seen in
women with a history of mental health or behavioural
conditions or adversity who account for of women
across all age groups Health visiting as an intervention
for birth outcomes is too late more evidence is needed
on the propensity for these women to benefit from
interventions before and during pregnancy including
whether different models of care are needed for younger
versus older women with psychosocial risk factors
Our study provides evidence to support health services
planning and evidence to support decisions about
whether and how scarce universal public health services
should be targeted in the context of decreasing funding
for public health services and the workforce including
health visiting In terms of population attributable risk
deprivation was a key factor followed by teenage
pregnancy of women were current or previous
teenage mothers Similar to previous studies these
effects were not fully explained by adjusting for other
risk factors Our findings indicate that primary
prevention strategies could be targeted at the population
level on the basis of age and socioeconomic background
Such strategies need to integrate cross sectoral agencies
this integration has for example been done by the
multifaceted policy intervention to reduce teenage
pregnancies in England the Teenage Pregnancy
Strategy which involved health and education agencies
and both contributed to a decline in teenage births and
attenuated the steep deprivation gradient Previous
research has also shown that the effects of teenage
motherhood persist for previous teenage mothers giving
birth again in their meaning that strategies to
improve reproductive choices for young women about
the timing of their pregnancies could have lasting
effects There is a need to understand how existing
services eg for teenage pregnancies contraception
sexual health services and drug and alcohol services can
best be integrated with support in early years to address
the needs of women affected by psychosocial risk factors
Our results also support previous evidence showing
that having a history of admissions for mental health or
behavioural conditions or adversity is an important
potential risk indicator for poor infant outcomes that
should be considered when supporting individual
women in clinical practice A UK study using primary
care records showed that a majority of mothers registered
with a general practice had received mental health
treatment or diagnosis between the birth of their child
and the child s birthday Parental mental health is
strongly linked to child and adolescent mental health and
mortality in early adulthood The high prevalence of
these parental health problems points to the need for
services in primary care mental health and maternity
and child health to be more responsive to the needs of
parents to improve outcomes for parents and their
children
Our findings show disparities in adverse outcomes for
the of women with one or more of the psychosocial
risk factors measured in our study Given that our study
was not able to account for mental health problems not
recorded in hospital admission records and that we only
considered the highest quintile of deprivation our results
are probably an underestimate of the true burden of
adverse infant outcomes in the community Effective
interventions before during and after pregnancy
are needed to reduce the downstream burden on
health services and prevent long term adverse effects for
children Upstream public health and economic
strategies are important to reduce socioeconomic
disparities Within health care efforts are needed across
primary and secondary services to address potential
effects of psychosocial presentations among women on
pregnancy and child outcomes

The impact on postpartum care by telehealth
a qualitative evaluation of the patient
Check for updates
perspective
OBJECTIVE During the COVID pandemic many
obstetrical practices began to provide postpartum care via tel
ehealth to minimize patient and clinician risk Telehealth
during the pandemic has been associated with increased post
partum visit attendance overall and reduced racial disparities
in attendance
In this study we aimed to investigate
patient preferences regarding postpartum visit modalities
barriers to or facilitators of telehealth in the postpartum
period and patient experiences with postpartum tele
health including perception of the clinician patient relation
ship and contraceptive counseling
STUDY DESIGN We conducted a qualitative study using
individual semi structured interviews Methods are reported
according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualita
tive Research guidelines This study was approved by the
University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board and
all participants provided informed consent
Interviews were conducted with patients who had a telehealth
postpartum visit scheduled between October and Jan
uary at a single institution with no exclusions Each
interview was performed within weeks of when their
appointment was scheduled Participants were purposively
sampled by age race insurance status parity and mode of
delivery to reflect the local patient population with the goal of
obtaining thematic saturation among both patients who were
and those who were not able to attend their visits
Interviews were transcribed by ADA Transcription Services
Mount Holly NJ and uploaded to NVivo QSR Interna
tional Burlington MA Qualitative data analysis was per
formed using grounded theory and coded using a systematic
approach by coders All transcripts were at least coded twice
with excellent intercoder reliability kappa O
RESULTS A total of interviews were performed The par
ticipant characteristics are shown in Table In total of
participants attended their visit and half of those had an in
person postpartum visit for a previous pregnancy for compar
ison Representative quotes for each theme described are
shown in Table
Overall patient s perspectives on the visit modality were
mixed Importantly patients noted their preference was fluid
and depended on the purpose of the visit and their circum
stances In our sample of patients preferred an in person
visit and preferred a telehealth visit It was noted that
the preference of of the cohort was dependent on

col MFM
external factors such as the mode of delivery and need for
further testing Interviewees emphasized the value of shared
decision making regarding visit modality unless otherwise
clinically indicated
For those who attended the telehealth postpartum visit the
majority of respondents focused on convenience as the pri
mary facilitator Patients described the lack of need to arrange
childcare and transportation and less time spent waiting Par
ticipants also discussed their ability to multitask while com
pleting their visits such as actively breastfeeding In addition
patients appreciated the ease of scheduling in person follow
up visits when warranted
Participants across the groups were split when asked about
barriers to attending postpartum care Although the majority
reported that telehealth relieved the need for childcare some
patients expressed difficulty engaging with the appointment
because of child related distractions For some childcare pre
vented them from attending the telehealth visit altogether
The most reported barrier among those unable to attend tele
medicine visits was scheduling challenges Some of these
patients also reported privacy concerns such as the inability
to find a private space for this visit On the other hand most
interviewees who were able to attend reported that technolog
ical difficulties were the biggest barrier expressing confusion
with operating the videoconferencing application or poor
connectivity Both groups voiced concerns about visit logis
tics such as needing frequent reminders and some reported a
lack of confidence in obtaining the requested vital signs at
home
Although most participants attending the telehealth visit
reported meaningful clinician engagement some discussed
concerns related to clinician attention Others reported feel
ing that the visit lacked comprehensiveness and that even
with video functionality their physical examination such as a
cesarean incision could not be appropriately checked
Patients reported increased comfort with telehealth if they
had met the same clinician in person previously
Furthermore most participants reported having in depth
contraceptive counseling and having their decision respected
In contrast some patients outlined negative experiences dis
cussing perceptions of pressure to decide unawareness of
patient LGBTQ status or an unclear plan on how to obtain
the desired contraception method in person such as an intra
uterine device
CONCLUSION This qualitative analysis provides insight on
patients preferences regarding postpartum visit types bar
riers to and facilitators of telehealth postpartum care and

Exemplary quote
l think there are certain periods when telehealth visits is absolutely enough But there s I think some critical
parts that it is better to be seen actually be seen by a provider
Because juggling a newborn and that new schedule just log in from the comfort of your own home without
having to think about what you re gonna do with the newborn and working around their schedule it just made
it so much less stressful
It was nice because I m breastfeeding an infant so all I had to do was turn on my camera and I could continue
to take care of my daughter
Because right now it s a pandemic and I don t want to go inside of the building and risk my health or risk
anybody inside of that building s health
Which it is hard to find a space I guess and a time when you re doing telehealth and you have kids at home
l had a telephone appointment and it never said what time it was and I had missed the phone call
You feel more comfortable saying things in person than you do over the phone and being recorded like a
privacy thing
So the sound and image I mean we corrected the sound through talking on the phone But I could see the
image was still moving Not moving Pausing and freezing a lot
It s a big difference because I can check my blood pressure but I m not sure if I m doing it correctly
l really wanted to have an in person even though the virus situation because I would feel totally secure by
visiting the office and he has all the testings done Because I m pretty sure that some of the testings were also
just not done because of the telehealth visit
I d much rather do a video than a phone call I feel like that s more personal
If I could barely see her the provider she could barely see me probably So she could probably barely see my
incision And she said it was healing properly and fine but how can you really know for sure if you don t see it
in person
l do feel like over telehealth I was there seemed to be more flexibility with the time I definitely felt like my
appointments were longer with the telehealth calls than they were in person And maybe there is something to
be said about that
I d met her before in person so it was just a pretty comforting conversation
The provider just asked what kind of birth control I wanted to do and I m not totally sure exactly which one I
want yet But she discussed the pros and cons of each and how each type of birth control worked she
prescribed me something that we re thinking I m gonna go with but I can obviously change my mind

Background Elective single embryo transfers are being increasingly used to curb the increase in multiple gestation rates However
it has been documented that single embryo transfers could still result in twins and on rarer occasions in triplet pregnancies Main
Body A literature review was done to highlight the possible mechanisms leading to embryonic splitting In this review the
incidence of zygotic splitting was addressed and the notion of chorionicity was explained Risk factors for zygotic splitting and
suggested mechanisms for both twin and higher order pregnancies were suggested and discussed Conclusion The hypotheses
that we have so far remain unproven due to the rarity of zygotic splitting as well as the ethicolegal considerations of human
embryo research The presence of such incidents necessitates extensive counselling of the couple
Introduction
Multiple gestations are the most frequent complications
associated with assisted reproductive techniques ART To
decrease the rate of twin and higher order multiple gesta
tions the elective single embryo transfer eSET is currently
encouraged However blastocyst stage SET was still found to
be associated with multiple gestations The present data
revealed that the frequency of embryo splitting post eSET
is with the rate of monozygotic twin and triplet
pregnancies being and respectively
However dizygotic twin and triplet pregnancies can also
be encountered post eSET Both monozygotic and dizy
gotic pregnancies can occur in the setting of fresh embryo
transfers in natural or modified natural frozen embryo
transfers FET and rarely in medicated FET cycles
Such events challenge the twinning dogma proposed by
Corner
Incidence of Zygotic Splitting after SET
Single embryo transfer is becoming the most favored
method of ART conclusion in recent years as it decreased
the complications associated with multiple gestations In
Japan for example up to of cycles account for SET
However multiple gestations in the form of mono or
dizygotic twinning are still encountered The classic defini
tion of when one embryo undergoes fission into or more
genetically identical embryos is called monozygotic splitting
while when different embryos implant a dizygotic preg
nancy ensures According to Ikemoto et al the rate of mul
tiple gestation after eSET is with the frequency of twin
and triplet pregnancies being and respectively
The frequency of zygotic splitting post SET was estimated to
be The findings of monochorionic and multiple
chorionic pregnancies in blastocyst eSET confirmed the fact
that embryo splitting took place after the transfer However
not all pregnancies are monozygotic As per Osianlis et al
the calculated dizygotic rate in their paper was with
an overall Di Di birth rate of Based on these numbers
they concluded that of the multizygotic pregnancies
are due to actual embryo splitting while the other could
be explained by concomitant natural conception at the same
time of the ART conception On another level the Japanese
ART national registry database along with a survey done by
Yamashita et al documented triplet pregnancies of
which were single gestational sac pregnancies were
double gestational sac pregnancies and were with ges
tational sacs It is worth mentioning that the trichorionic
pregnancies had zero fetuses in cases fetus in cases
fetuses in cases and three fetuses in cases One qua
druplet case was also documented
Chorionicity
Chorionicity refers to the placenta the origin of which can be
determined accurately Zygosity on the other hand which is
the origin of the fetus can be predicted in half of the cases as
multiple gestation pregnancies can originate from one or
multiple embryos especially when the sex of the babies is dis
cordant Given this fact same sex twins or triplets could be
true monozygotic or dizygotic in origin The only way to
accurately diagnose the zygosity is to do DNA fingerprinting
which is expensive and thus not performed in daily practice
In contrast monochorionic multiple gestations are
always monozygotic Originally it was thought that the
earlier the embryonic division the more separate and inde
pendent the fetuses were In other words cleavage stage
divisions were believed to result in dichorionic diamniotic
pregnancies while blastocyst stage divisions resulted in
monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancies
According to Konno et al dichorionic pregnancies were
found to be more common with ART As such we can
conclude that SET can result in monozygotic monochorio
nic and multichorionic as well as dizygotic pregnancies
multichorionic pregnancies
Risk Factors
Naturally occurring twinning especially the dizygotic form
is believed to be linked to a genetic predisposition most com
monly located on chromosome Some ethnicities
were found to be more predisposed to dizygotic twinning
where the rate reached in Nigeria This con
trasts with the naturally occurring monozygotic twinning
which was found to be nonaffected by the ethnicity or the
genetic makeup of the couple ART on the other
hand has increased the incidence of monozygotic twining
It has been shown that the patient s young age might predis
pose to zygotic twinning while unexplained infertility was
found to be protective It was proposed that ART
associated embryo manipulations such as FET per se blasto
cyst culture and assisted hatching could be risk factors for
zygotic splitting while the zona manipulation of the oocyte
in the form of intracytoplasmic sperm insemination ICSI
was not Interestingly there was no difference in
Journal of Pregnancy
the splitting rate neither between the cleavage stage and
the blastocyst stage transfers nor between fresh and frozen
embryo transfer cycles Another risk factor for splitting
is a lower inner cell mass ICM grading of B or C It is
thought that loose intercellular connections may induce
the ICM fission This has been documented through
the time lapse imaging The quality of the culture media
is also thought to stimulate zygotic splitting An increase in
the free radicals concentration due to increased glucose con
centration in the culture media used for prolonged culture
could lead to ICM splitting at the site of glucose induced
apoptosis of certain regions of the ICM The new sequential
culture systems with antioxidant activity might explain the
lack of increase of the rate of embryo splitting despite the
major increase in the number of IVF cycles and embryo
transfers worldwide When coupled with the improvement
in the embryologists training and experience the rate of
splitting associated with a blastocyst transfer has been found
to decrease The OR for embryo splitting decreased
from to when comparing the periods of to
and to Embryo biopsy on the other
hand was not found to increase the risk of embryo splitting
contrary to what was believed before
Suggested Mechanisms of Division
It has been shown that blastomeres from a cell stage
embryo can develop into an ICM and trophectoderm hence
any division after this stage could give rise to or more
embryos with an implantation potential Of the sug
gested mechanisms abnormal cellular axis formation and
cytoplasm folding in the secondary oocyte prior to fertiliza
tion or during the actual fertilization lead to duplication It is
speculated that gonadotropin stimulation might disrupt the
fine balance and gradients of signalling molecules affecting
the polarity of the oocyte This is thought to lead to the for
mation of cells referred to as daughter cells or tertiary
oocytes that could be fertilized This is speculated to be
caused by the displacement of the meiotic spindle due to
oocyte aging postovulation This disruption might lead to
the duplication of the axes and formation of embryos upon
fertilization or the fission of the ICM into at the blastocyst
stage This theory would be replaced later on by the for
mation of zygotes postfertilization of the secondary oocyte
and not blastomeres Other studies advocated the fis
Sion to happen closer to the cleavage stage and thus the
sequence of events happening during hatching would then
explain the type of the twin gestation If both blastocysts
were released at the same time then the resultant pregnancy
would be a dichorionic diamniotic twin gestation If on the
other hand the blastocysts fused with the conservation of
separate ICMs prior to hatching then monochorionic
diamniotic twins would appear If complete fusion of the
trophectoderm and the ICM happened then monochorionic
monoamniotic twins would be created Another
suggestion was that the ICM would split due to mechanical
compression during hatching through the manipulated zona
pellucida of the embryo which is also referred to as atypical
hatching This atypical hatching is referred to as
Journal of Pregnancy
shaped hatching which usually takes place when the
embryo is squeezing out through the hatch of the hardened
zona pellucida due to prolonged culture to blastocyst stage
and in cryopreserved thawed blastocysts especially with the
application of the day prehatching protocol It is
speculated that this phenomenon might also be the culprit
for the monozygotic triplet gestations that have been docu
mented post SET Another possible explanation to dual
or even more ICM is the nature of human blastomere
plasticity Studies have shown that isolated trophectoderm
cells when cultivated could give rise to a whole new embryo
with an implantation potential As such if a blastomere
gets separated from the trophectoderm into the blastocele
due to low grade compaction of the trophectoderm this
blastomere could give rise to an ICM Theoretically each
ICM should give rise to a separate fetus with the surround
ing amnion while the chorion develops during the implanta
tion The mechanism of chorionic differentiation between
mono and higher order chorionicity in monozygotic preg
nancies is still unknown
Triplets Possible Explanation
The explanation of embryo splitting into three is challenging
since triplets after SET is a very rare event What is known so
far is that to have implantation an embryo with an intact
ICM should be present The number of the ICM that the
embryo has will define the number of fetuses that will be
seen on the pregnancy ultrasound The chorionicity of the
pregnancy will depend on the number of zygotes present at
the time of implantation In theory the chorion should rise
from trophectoderm cells thus it would be logical to con
sider that the higher the order of the chorionicity the higher
the number of separate embryos available for implantation
In the setting of monochorionic triplets it is believed that
the blastocyst harbors three distinct ICMs The mechanism
of their creation might be similar to the ones suggested for
the monochorionic twin gestation The trigger factor for
the splitting into and not into is still unknown In the set
ting of the multichorionic triplets a suggested explanation
might be the complete division of the hatching embryos
resulting in and not only fully hatched embryo Another
possible explanation for this is if the origin of the sister ICMs
is a trophectoderm blastomere Since the implantation
potential of reconstructed embryos cannot be tested at this
point due to ethical reasons one can only postulate that such
cellular plasticity might confer to the newly formed ICM the
whole genetic makeup necessary for a successful implanta
tion and healthy fetal development
The question that arises here is that whether the embryo
initially had multiple ICM followed by trophectoderm split
ting upon hatching or the splitting of the ICM took place
during hatching due to the mechanical pressure exerted by
the hardened zona pellucida The latter might explain the
high incidence of blighted ova in triplet pregnancies Due
to the abnormal cell division in the embryo s as well as
increased cellular stress the ICM fails to continue its
division resulting in a blighted ovum
Conclusion
Zygotic splitting is a well described event in ART yet the
complete mechanism of these events is not completely eluci
dated The hypotheses that we have so far remain unproven
due to the rarity of zygotic splitting as well as the ethicolegal
considerations of human embryo research The presence of
such incidents necessitates extensive counselling of couples
undergoing SET

Introduction
Models of abortion care are continually evolving and expanding
Historically advocates lawyers journalists clinicians and researchers
have used a variety of terms to refer to different types of abortion In
Weitz and colleagues published an editorial laying out the need
to develop consensus on standard terms because the terminology
used to describe abortion procedures influences political legislative
and medical institutions
Ill
Standardization of abortion nomen
clature and terms used to refer to different types of abortion will in
crease uniformity and accuracy in communication about abortion care
The Society of Family Planning s recommendation is to use the terms
medication abortion and procedural abortion for common use in clinical
guidance journal articles print materials websites media advocacy
policy briefs and other communication about abortion care These
recommendations align with recommendations from several other
organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists
the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
and the
COMS Project We recognize the importance of language and its role
in providing access to care that is both equitable and that centers the
patient experience We also recognize that language is complex and
nuanced We encourage medical societies and others in sexual and
reproductive health rights and justice fields to use these terms while
also inviting discussion and continued research on the optimal ap
proach to abortion nomenclature
Recommendations
a Abortion primarily with medications including mifepristone
misoprostol and misoprostol alone should be referred to as
medication abortion regardless of the setting context gestational
duration or legal status
Conflicts of interest The authors report no conflicts The Society of Family Planning receives no direct support from pharmaceutical companies or other industries for the

Historically a variety of terms have been used to refer to medi
cation abortion medical abortion the abortion pill s
abortion with pills pharmaceutical abortion medicinal abortion no
test abortion no touch abortion medically induced and induction
termination
The term medication abortion is now widely used in the United
States which suggests ease of comprehension and adoption by the
media advocates and policy makers It is also the accepted term in
clinical practice and scientific publications However widespread
public knowledge that one can end a pregnancy with medications
remains limited In a nationally representative survey of
participants assigned female at birth were aware of medication
abortion In another study done in less than a third of
U S adults reported having heard of mifepristone
Furthermore
people who report being aware of medication abortion often erro
neously confuse it with emergency contraception
The term medication abortion is preferable because the me
chanism that medications are involved is intuitively understood
unlike medical abortion Medical may imply that the abortion is
being done for medical reasons is a medical necessity or requires a
complication of pregnancy to be completed Medical also implies
the medical infrastructure or health care system is required or in
volved However medication abortion can also safely occur outside
of the formal health care system as with self managed medication
abortion
Greater use of the term medication abortion may
facilitate and expand public knowledge that an abortion with pills
exists as an option
b Abortion primarily with instrumentation including uterine as
piration manual or electric dilation and curettage dilation and
evacuation or dilation and extraction should be referred to as
procedural abortion or abortion procedure regardless of the set
ting context pregnancy duration or legal status
The following terms have been used to refer to procedural
abortion surgical aspiration in clinic procedure instrumentation
surgery put to sleep anesthesia abortion manual electric vacuum
aspiration suction abortion and uterine scraping The term proce
dural abortion conveys that it involves a mechanical intervention
that is facilitated by a skilled clinician
This avoids creating ar
tificial distinctions based on the stage of the pregnancy e g by
trimester specific tools or resources available to the clinician or
setting The term procedural abortion may be new for patients but
greater use of this term may facilitate a more accurate under
standing of what it involves
The term procedural abortion groups multiple clinical abortion
techniques using a common term For specific documents or con
texts such as medical charts research or patient counseling spe
cifying the technique used to perform the abortion procedure may
be necessary
While there is greater variation in preferred nomenclature for this
type of abortion there is broad consensus that the terms surgical and
dilation curettage should be avoided The term procedural avoids a
false suggestion that the procedure involves incisions Surgical abor
obfuscating the training requirements for
tion is a misnomer
provision Physician assistants nurse practitioners midwives and
other clinicians who are not clearly labeled as surgeons can provide
high quality and safe procedural abortion care The use of the term
surgical has fueled a perception that abortion carries substantial risks
when it is in fact an essential and extremely safe intervention
Labeling abortion procedures as surgery may evoke for the
patient scary imagery of a sterile surgical suite with scalpels and
monitors that is inconsistent with offce based care contributes to
wider misunderstanding
and provides an erroneous rationale
that abortion care must be done in an ambulatory surgical center Most
procedural abortions are safely completed in an outpatient clinical care
Contraception
setting similar to an intrauterine device IUD insertion and do not
The complexity of support services required is

usually related to the type of pain relief anesthesia or analgesia of
fered to the patient rather than the abortion procedure performed The
term dilation and curettage is also a misnomer as guidelines re
commend against the practice of using a sharp curette to scrape the
uterus and it is no longer the recommended primary method used in a
procedural abortion
Continued discussion
During the development of this document we identified multiple
areas where further discussion research and consensus are needed
specific to abortion nomenclature and terminology
Qualifiers such as induced spontaneous missed medically in
dicated and elective are often used to describe abortion or in
efforts to distinguish abortion from pregnancy loss or to differ
entiate why a patient is seeking abortion
Although out
side the original scope of the document it is important to uplift
this conversation as it directly impacts the broader abortion
nomenclature paradigm On a policy level using disparate lan
guage to describe care reinforces abortion stigma enabling leg
islation that limits patients options
There seems to be
consensus that qualifiers such as medically indicated and elective
are not needed when describing abortion or pregnancy loss in
clinical guidance research publications print materials websites
media advocacy legislation and other communication with the
public However more work is needed to explore how to best use
the terms recommended in this guidance and still recognize the
patient preferred language in individual counseling
Current international classification of disease ICD and current
procedural terminology CPT codes for pregnancy loss and
abortion include descriptors such as missed and induced
which may contribute to confusion stigma and bias
Consideration should be given to using medication and procedural
to describe the management of pregnancy loss i e medication
management of pregnancy loss and procedural management of
pregnancy loss
The terms medication abortion and procedural abortion may not
translate into other languages or be used commonly in practice
outside of the United States More work is needed in order to
explore and uplift ideal terminology in languages other than
English and to build international consensus
The terms gestational duration and pregnancy duration may be
preferable to the term gestational age which personifies the fetus
Conclusion
As abortion care models expand we need to review our termi
nology and refine our language as needed These recommended
terms may continue to evolve and we invite continued discussion
and research on the topic among all stakeholders Additionally for
specific documents or contexts such as medical charts and research
further clarification detail and definitions may be needed to de
scribe the specific type of intervention and model of care When
counseling people seeking to end a pregnancy there may be a
need to use terminology that is aligned with each individual s un
derstanding and values However for common use in clinical gui
dance research publications print materials websites media
advocacy legislation and other communication with the public we
encourage those in the sexual and reproductive health rights and
justice fields to use the terms medication abortion and procedural
abortion Using uniform language will support greater shared public
knowledge of the different abortion types minimize myths and
misperceptions and ensure public discussions reflect the latest

preferred terminology Given that abortion is increasingly in public
discourse and the terminology used to describe abortion influences
political legislative and medical institutions the use of standard
terminology is as important as ever

Purpose Studies focusing on safety outcomes typically require large populations to comprehensively characterise the patient
groups exposed to the medicines under investigation However there is often less information for subpopulations such as
pregnant or breastfeeding women particularly when new medicines are considered It is important to understand what
information can be obtained from drug utilization studies DUS involvmg pregnant women in the early years postmarketing
to provide supportive information for safety studies The aims of this literature review are to identify and review DUS for
new medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding and list and summarise key information items to be reported in a DUS for
new medicines in pregnancy Methods To identify postmarketing DUS of new prescription medicines or enantiomers in
pregnancy a systematic literature review was undertaken in PubMed and Embase between January and June In
addition the complete database of the ENCePP EU PAS Register was systematically searched to June Results We
identified published DUS on new medicines in pregnancy from the ENCePP EU PAS Register and none from other sources
No studies on breastfeeding were identified The identified publications reported the medicme s use for the first to years
after marketing approval No reports assessed utilization in the first years of approval It was usual to issue interim reports
annually studies All studies concerned conditions managed in ambulatory care primary care and outpatient facilities and
included some primary care prescribing Most n only had prescribing dispensing data available at individual level for
ambulatory care outpatient prescribing was included in three of these studies Three studies held a limited amount of in hospital
prescribing data A DUS can confirm at an early stage whether there are suffcient exposed pregnancies m available data sources to
ensure a safety study is powered to detect a difference in the prevalence of adverse pregnancy or infant outcomes or if additional
data from other databases are needed A DUS may also help address methodological considerations such as selection of
comparators DUS can be performed embedded in a DUS in the general population in a cohort of women of childbearing age or
in a cohort of pregnant women Conclusion This review summarises key aspects of a DUS for new medicines in pregnancy DUS
for new medicines in pregnancy should be planned before marketing scheduled for the first to years after release with annual
interim progress reports and reported in peer reviewed journals By offering detailed information on data sources exposure
timing prevalence and location coprescribing comorbidities coexposures and demographics a DUS will offer a firm foundation
for safety studies and will help to contextuahze spontaneous reporting of serious adverse events
Introduction
Humans are exposed to new medicines for the first time in
the context of preapproval clinical trials However some
of the clinical trials exclude pregnant and breastfeeding
women due to ethical legal and safety concerns of repro
ductive toxicity of the new medicine Therefore informa
tion regarding the use of new medicines during pregnancy
and breastfeeding is often listed as missing in the summary
of product characteristics and a postapproval plan is needed
to evaluate the safety of the newly approved product
During drug development and before marketing authori
zation is granted the safety of a new medicine is evaluated in
preclinical studies including reproductive toxicity studies in
mammals In addition the safety information for new medi
cines may be supplemented by pooling data from patients
who unexpectedly become pregnant during the preapproval
clinical trials In the absence of safety concerns or signals
related to pregnancy exposure during drug development once
the new medicine is on the market it is subjected to safety
monitoring using pharmacovigilance procedures Solicited
or spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions
ADRs including adverse pregnancy outcomes e g congen
ital anomalies and pregnancy exposure with and without
ADRs are collected by marketing authorization holders and
regulatory authorities such as the EMA however it is esti
mated that only of all ADRs are spontaneously reported
and reporting is vulnerable to bias Therefore there
is a need to supplement spontaneous reports and solicited
reports of ADRs with data from other sources for exam
ple by secondary use of routinely collected healthcare data
to further investigate the potential harms risks and benefits
Use of whole population data removes selection bias including
volunteer bias Even if use of a medicine is not recom
mended or contraindicated in pregnancy women unaware
of their pregnancies may receive a prescription or there may
be no alternative to treat maternal conditions Therefore
many new medicines are first used in secondary or tertiary
care under specialist supervision however some healthcare
databases do hold information on hospital prescribing DUS
were defined by the World Health Organization as studies
which study the marketing distribution prescription and
use of medicinal products in a society with special emphasis
on the resulting medical and socioeconomic consequences
The thalidomide tragedy may have faded from public
consciousness but the failure to act on the teratogenicity
and neurodevelopmental harms of valproic acid derivatives
for over two decades from to indicates that
the problem persists It has been reported that it takes
on average years confidence interval CI
years to determine the safety of a new medicine in pregnant
women therefore there is a need to help expedite the
safety evaluation for new medicines and enantiomers A
drug utilization study DUS can help by adding effciency
to medication safety evaluation during pregnancy
Several guidelines and books consider
DUS in the general nonpregnant population The book

GUARD provides examples of DUS and Rasmussen
et al list the core concepts that can be used in DUS these
authors list appropriate analytical approaches for designing
a DUS e g basic epidemiological measures adherence
combinations of medicines switching polypharmacy and
drug misuse A tool was developed in to assess
the quality of DUS and drug utilization reviews however
this tool was created for primary data collection often in
relation to audit or prescribing quality rather than pharma
coepidemiological studies involving routine healthcare data
bases The EQUATOR network offers guidelines on
observational studies and pharmacoepidemiological
studies using routine healthcare data To our knowl
edge there is no specific guideline for DUS during preg
nancy using secondary data sources that details items to be
captured recorded and reported The objectives of this liter
ature review are to identify and review DUS for new
medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding list and sum
marise key information items to be reported in a DUS for
new medicines in the last years in pregnancy and
report on the earliest timeframe between introduction to
the market and evaluation of DUS during pregnancy
This publication is part of the Innovative Medicines Ini
tiative IMI ConcePTION project which aims to build an
ecosystem for better monitoring and communication of
medication safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding The
results of this study will help guide future DUS for new
drugs in pregnancy and potentially breastfeeding breast
feeding was omitted due to lack of data
Methods
Literature Search To identify postmarketing DUS of new
medicines in pregnancy a systematic review was undertaken
in two stages In PubMed Embase and the ENCePP
EU PAS Register were searched The publication date was lim
ited to through The search was
restricted to publications in English for further details on
the search strategy see Appendix The inclusion criterion
was assessment of the utilization of new medicines during
pregnancy or breastfeeding New medicines were defined
as those that reached the market within years of the date of
data analysis or review New medicines include new mole
cules enantiomers generics biosimilars and formulations
In addition data were collected on routes of administration
and indications In the ENCePP EU PAS Register preg
nancy were selected as other population and drug utiliza
tion study was selected under scope of study The register
did not have an option to search breastfeeding lactation
Studies identified via the ENCePP EU PAS Register were
included if they mentioned that they were going to study drug
utilization in pregnancy or breastfeeding in their protocol
Screening Studies with only the abstract available were
excluded
All titles and abstracts were initially screened to identify
DUS Full texts of potentially relevant studies were then

Data Extraction Five reviewers JS KW MS JM and
DM undertook data extraction from the included studies
using a data extraction Excel sheet Information on key
aspects of a DUS was extracted from the title introduction
methods tables results and discussion of each included study
The key aspects of the studies were the pertinent items of
information reported Each study was scrutinized by two
researchers independently and findings were compared The
findings were consistent and there were no disagreements
Data Synthesis All the extracted information from the
included studies was captured in Excel tables
Developing Recommendations Information items
reported in the published studies and protocols were tabu

returned to all studies and calculated the number of stud
ies reporting each information item This number is
included next to each item and helps us understand which
items are commonly included
Results
After removing the duplicates a total of unique poten
tially relevant studies were identified in PubMed and
Embase However none of the studies were DUS for new
drugs The search in the ENCePP EU PAS Register identified
studies Thirty seven studies were excluded because they
did not include a study concept protocol or study report
n or because they were not in English n Of the
studies screened were DUS Twenty three were
excluded because they did not study a new drug and were
excluded because they did not included data on either preg
nancy or breastfeeding Figure PRISMA

For a new medicine on the market readers will need to
understand when the new medicine was approved by regula
tory authorities and when it was launched and available in
the countries regions under investigation There are cases
where there is a considerable delay between the regulatory
approval date and the availability of the new medicine in
routine care mainly driven by reimbursement decisions
guidelines or prescribers caution There may be fur
ther delays before data are available for research due to time
lag in the databases Table lists information that is perti
nent to contextualization of the results of a DUS If informa
tion is unobtainable or unknown this should be noted
The last part of the introduction should explain the pur
pose of conducting the DUS Table describes appropriate
objectives for DUS For example a DUS can help determine
whether the contributing databases are adequate for possible
further safety studies on a new medicine e g if the medi
cine and timing of administration are fully recorded
Items for a DUS Methods and Results
Databases Table lists items to be considered in the
methods and results section of a DUS for a new medicine
DUS typically use large population based databases e g
prescription databases reimbursement claims databases or
linked health service records If the DUS is used to plan a
future pregnancy safety study the numbers of exposed and
unexposed pregnancies in the DUS can be used to determine
the achievable level of precision for the risk of predefined
adverse pregnancy outcomes If several databases are
included results should be stratified by country database to
identify similarities and differences between databases This
will determine if it is appropriate to plan a meta analysis
or aggregated multilevel analysis in further studies Potential
confounding factors should be included to address threats to
validity in real world settings any associations between
maternal medicines and infant outcomes may be con
founded by concomitant exposures and demographic fac
tors All possible confounding variables should be
described by group with or without inferential analyses
Items for a DUS Considerations for Study Discussion
Table describes topics that should be considered for inclu
Sion in the discussion section
Discussion
We identified very few published DUS designed to deter
mine the use of new medicines in pregnant or breastfeeding
women Most studies were aimed at determining if pregnant
women were taking the medicine of interest From the eight
studies that presented results five did not identify any
women prescribed the medicine of interest and two did not
present any information on pregnancy in their study reports
Publication bias is possible given that studies identifying
zero or very few exposed pregnant women may not be pub
lished or if pregnant women exposed this may not be
published due to governance restrictions on reporting of
low numbers Low numbers of recorded exposures dur
ing pregnancy or breastfeeding during the medicine s first
years on the market militates against safety assessments
should the medicine be used by these vulnerable groups
Establishing consortia of databases including primary sec
ondary and tertiary care data for DUS in pregnancy and
breastfeeding would address this problem If no
exposed pregnancies are identified across several whole
population databases with primary secondary and tertiary
care prescribing it would suggest that the medicine is not
being prescribed to pregnant women and further safety

TABLE Discussion
Summary of results including items based on Table where appropriate
Findings should be compared with other DUS from other regions countries or
other medicines in same class or other treatments for the same indication or condition
ideally with putative explanations of any differences and similarities
Results should be discussed in the context of the regulatory approval status
on versus off label use in childbearing or pregnant women of the newly approved
medicine or existing treatment guidelines
Information on pregnancies
Identification of pregnancies start date might be diffcult to identify
Information on drug exposure
Drug exposure identified by prescriptions prescribed dispensed or reimbursed in
secondary sources may not fully represent actual exposure due to nonadherence or
irregular adherence
Not all databases have information on indication duration of prescription
Is all exposure captured For example are in hospital administrations
private prescriptions medicines that are not reimbursed included in the data
Nature of the database
Size of datasets
Whole population data
Representativeness of the national or regional population
Ability to capture all types of pregnancies in the database
The database best suited to the study depends on the purpose of the study
Explain selection of database
Timing of data collection prospectively collected data is free of recall bias
Completeness of data source number extent of geographies covered
Any regional differences may be related to prescribing guidelines or custom and practice
Representativeness of overall studied population e g not only the better educated
nonsmokers and older mothers
Is the medicine being used by childbearing pregnant women
Is the medicine prescribed in primary secondary or tertiary care
When in pregnancy for how long in pregnancy what doses for what indications
time trends
studies needing large samples would be premature mean
while voluntary adverse event reporting databases should
be scrutinized for serious adverse events including congen
ital anomalies
The studies identified addressed conditions generally man
aged in ambulatory care and ten of reported on long term
conditions However many new medicines are introduced in
secondary and tertiary care as this is where most severe condi
tions and sickest patients are treated New medicines are most
frequently developed for the most serious conditions for exam
ple in the UK in of new products launched were
to treat immunological and malignant disorders and for the
next highest categories cardiovascular and infectious diseases
However eight of publications identified had no in
hospital prescribing data and five had only primary care pre
scribing although some of the regimens recorded may be initi
ated by specialists based in secondary or tertiary care Table
DUS on new medicines for immunological and malignant dis
orders were not located despite this being the largest prescrib
ing category Large scale patient data on hospital
prescribing are scarce Many routine healthcare data
bases particularly in Europe do not include in hospital pre
scribing and therefore if the medicine is restricted to hospital
use it is not possible to undertake a DUS For example
most intravenous medicines particularly anticancer treatments
are administered in hospitals and not reliably recorded in pri
mary care Therefore restricting a DUS to ambulatory or pri
mary care without first ascertaining use in secondary care
may generate misleading and invalid conclusions regarding
prevalence of exposure in pregnancy
There was only one study that exclusively studied preg
nant women and only one study that focused on women of
childbearing age The other nine studies evaluated drug utili
zation in the general population for all users of the medicine s
in question as a stratification they estimated the frequency of
pregnant women prescribed the medicine of interest Three of
these studies stated in their protocol that they intended to
assess utilization in pregnancy however when the results were
published no data on pregnancy was presented EMA guide
lines on registry based studies state that feasibility analy
ses may be submitted separately or as part of a proposed
protocol for a registry based study However it is also impor
tant to publish information derived from pregnancies in feasi
bility studies as this can guide the protocols of future studies
The methods used for DUS of older products are very
similar to those identified for new products Most DUS for
new and established medicines focus on estimating the num
ber of pregnant women prescribed the medicine When new
medicines are considered initially few people are exposed
militating against a comprehensive evaluation of some areas
of concern particularly pregnancy and breastfeeding The
objective of a DUS for a new product should be to expedite
facilitate and guide the assessment of safety concerns during
pregnancy Drug safety studies can be planned in parallel or
sequentially using the same databases as the DUS As
observed in several of the studies the protocol of a DUS
can be written before the medicine is on the market When
planned as a phased approach the main objective may be to
determine when there is enough power to perform a safety
Journal of Pregnancy
study Determining sample size ensures that risk estimates
are precise if a study is too small it will yield wide confidence
intervals and imprecise estimates Other DUS objectives
include identification and prevalence of risk factors that may
be confounders such as comedications comorbidities smok
ing age education body weight substance misuse and any
differences between exposed and nonexposed populations
particularly women of childbearing age The DUS will also
generate knowledge of the unique characteristics of the data
sources regarding medicine exposure and can establish the
strengths and limitations of each database so that a range of
databases can be considered to account for known risk factors
For example the Nordic databases hold data on paternity
while Wales holds data on substance misuse When a
DUS is conducted in parallel with a safety study the informa
tion can inform decision points as to phasing and interpreting
the safety study results However complete and accurate data
linkage is essential for safety studies
Limitations and Strengths The biggest limitation of this
systematic review is that very few DUS for new drugs are
being published There were insufficient studies to illustrate
good practice however the available studies offered an over
view of the optimal structure for a DUS in this field
Tables These were considered in association
with existing reporting guidelines A central prob
lem with DUS for new medicines in pregnancy is the
absence of whole population databases for hospital prescrib
ing Prescription and administration data have been cap
tured electronically for many years in most hospitals
however even some well established national healthcare
databases have been unable to link this key data Therefore
pharmacoepidemiologists can only investigate potential
adverse effects of medicines amongst the less ill primary care
population while key signals for harm are missed due to the
fragmentation of data capture for the vulnerable unwell
hospital population New technical financial and gover
nance barriers are not immutable and integrated databases
may well emerge in the future While the majority of preg
nant women are healthy a few experience serious health
problems whose treatment can only be evaluated from hos
pital prescribing data the rarity of serious illness in preg
nancy necessitates combining data from large populations
Comprehensive information is even more important for
safety studies particularly where prescribing is expected to
be low or minimized due to manufacturers warnings
regarding unknown safety in pregnancy or contraindica
tions By accounting for all the items listed above
researchers increase the likelihood that the only remaining
plausible explanation for harm identified is the prescribed
medicine We made no recommendation in relation to
breastfeeding because no studies reported drug utilization
during or preceding breastfeeding very few databases hold
data on breastfeeding
Conclusions
This review of DUS for medicines new to the market illus
trates how DUS might add efficiency to the evaluation of
Journal of Pregnancy
medicines during pregnancy A DUS supports safety studies
by providing
i early confirmation as to whether there are suffcient
exposed pregnancies to provide adequate statistical
power to detect an association with an adverse preg
nancy outcome
ii context and information to evaluate whether addi
tional data from other data sources or more time
are needed
iii information on the most appropriate data sources
to use
iv guidance on the optimal methods for a safety study
such as selection of comparator medicines or
participants
These considerations are particularly relevant where
adverse outcomes are relatively common and with multiple
aetiologies for example small for gestational age or absence of
breastfeeding following antidepressant exposure This does
not detract from the reporting of major congenital anomalies
This paper offers suggestions as to considerations when
planning and reporting DUS for new drugs in pregnant
women Such studies may be planned before marketing
either embedded in a DUS in the general population or in
a retrospective cohort of pregnant women typically for the
first to years after release with annual interim progress
reports These reports may provide patient numbers or sta
tus progress updates to guide safety studies and augment
interpretation of spontaneous pharmacovigilance reports
which start as soon as the drug is marketed The results of
these interim reports final reports should be available in peer
reviewed journals so that researchers and physicians can
access the information easily DUS for new drugs and safety
studies can be planned with a phased or parallel approach to
expedite the knowledge generation regarding the safety of
medicines used during pregnancy and breastfeeding

Abstract
Background Pregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes Even in
uncomplicated pregnancies these changes can affect the quality of life QOL of pregnant women affecting both
maternal and infant health The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated
pregnancy and to assess its associated socio demographic physical and psychological factors in developed
countries
Methods A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines Searches were made in
PubMed EMBASE and BDSP Public Health Database Two independent reviewers extracted the data Countries
with a human development index over were selected The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of
the STROBE criteria
Results In total thirty seven articles were included While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout
pregnancy the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy Main factors
associated with better QOL were mean maternal age primiparity early gestational age the absence of social and
economic problems having family and friends doing physical exercise feeling happiness at being pregnant and
being optimistic Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction complications
before or during pregnancy obesity nausea and vomiting epigastralgia back pain smoking during the months
prior to conception a history of alcohol dependence sleep difficulties stress anxiety depression during pregnancy
and sexual or domestic violence
Conclusions Health related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical
mental and social dimensions of well being Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better
identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible
Keywords Quality of life Pregnancy Primary care Health related quality of life Measurement
Background
According to the World Health Organization quality of
life QOL is defined as individuals perception of their
position in life in the context of the culture and value sys
tems in which they live and in relation to their goals ex
pectations standards and concerns This is a very broad
concept and one that can be influenced in a complex
way by the physical health of the subject his or her psy
chological state and level of independence social

try to satisfy their patients with respect to their experi
ence during preconception and pregnancy periods
Traditionally used pregnancy outcome measures such
as morbidity and mortality rates remain essential How
ever they are not sufficient on their own because popu
lation health should be assessed not only on the basis of
saving lives but also in terms of improving quality of life
Over the past decades numerous instruments have
been developed to measure HRQOL in various patient
populations with basic approaches generic and
disease specific While generic measures for ex
ample the SF Short Form Item and
WHOQOL BREF World Health Organization s Quality
of Life Scale have broad application across different
types and severity of diseases disease specific measures
are designed to assess particular diseases or patient pop
ulations To our knowledge there is no review of the lit
erature to describe the quality of life of pregnant women
in primary care The objectives of this study were to de
scribe the quality of life during uncomplicated preg
nancy and to assess its associated socio demographic
physical and psychological factors in developed
countries
Methods
Type of study
The study consisted of a systematic review of the litera
ture in the PUBMED EMBASE and BDSP databases
BDSP is the French Public Health Database The
search was performed according to the Preferred Report
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses
PRISMA criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The search strategy and inclusion exclusion criteria
were developed by the whole group of authors after
which two authors LN and IG individually con
ducted the literature search Key search terms in
cluded Pregnancy Quality of life or Health

with reference to relevant index terms MeSH Emtree
or Thesaurus All observational studies e g cohort
cross sectional case control which were published in
English and French prior to March have been
considered no restriction in the starting date Devel
oped countries were chosen as a basis for the re
search to ensure epidemiological uniformity In order
to define a list of developed countries comparable to
France countries with a human development index
HDI of over were selected This list provided by
Page of
the United Nations UN is available online
Studies measuring quality of life with a single ques
tion were excluded Studies on specific popu
lations women with complicated pregnancy or on a
specific scale of quality of life sexual HRQOL or
HRQOL in relation to faecal incontinence etc were
also excluded as it is not possible to compare pa

Article selection and quality assessment
A preliminary selection was made from the titles then
another on reading the summaries and a lastly on a
reading of the entire article Publications related to the
selected articles as well as the bibliography of the se
lected articles were also examined Two independent re
viewers extracted the data LN and IG Disagreement
between reviewers was resolved by consensus The qual
ity of the articles was evaluated using the STROBE cri
teria ST rengthening the Reporting of OBservational
studies in Epidemiology
Analysis
The results were organised in two sections first a descrip
tion of the quality of life of pregnant women in developed
countries and second by the socio demographic physical
and psychological factors associated with their quality of
life When the study compared two quality of life scales
we used only the Gold Standard scale In the

subgroup we have retained the control group that was
most representative of the general population of pregnant
women where all subjects in the study would have re
sulted in a serious selection bias

The progression of the quality of life during the trimesters
Of the studies selected described the
progression of QOL using SF or SF Figs
The study of the SF PCS and MCS aggregate
scores revealed that there were significant variations
during the trimesters Fig
The PCS values ranged from to during the
trimester between and during the trimester
between and during the trimester For
SF values ranged from to in the trimester
and in the trimester and and in the
trimester The results of the studies indicated a decrease
in physical quality of life throughout pregnancy particu
larly related to decreased physical activity and functional
limitations related to physical health and physical pain
In terms of prevalence the Haas et al study in
showed an increase in pregnant women with poor
physical quality of life during pregnancy of preg
nant women in the second trimester and in the
third trimester The proportion of pregnant
women reporting generally poor health score O to
increased from to and and then
decreased to in the postpartum period
The MCS values were as follows for the SF in
the trimester values between a minimum of

Factors influencing quality of life
The results of studies on the factors associated with the
quality of life of pregnant women are presented in Ta
bles and Thirty three articles were selected for this
section
Socio demographic factors
The following socio demographic factors were strongly
associated with a better quality of life in studies
mean maternal age primiparity early gestational age
the absence of economic problems a high educational
level being employed being married having family and
friends With less consensus belonging to an ethnic mi
nority and alcohol consumption have also been associ
ated in studies with a poorer quality of life
Physical factors
Medically assisted reproduction obstetric complications
medical history possible hospitalisation and obesity were
factors frequently indicating a poor quality of life during
pregnancy in studies Physical symptoms associated
with pregnancy such as nausea and vomiting epigastral
gia reflux shortness of breath dizziness back pain and
sleep problems affected women s quality of life Exercise
was a factor that improved the quality of life of pregnant
women With less consensus we found other factors as
sociated with a poorer QOL such as smoking during the
months prior to conception a history of alcohol depend
ence and poor comfort
Psychological factors
Eight studies have shown that symptoms of depression
anxiety and stress were factors that had a strong nega
tive impact on the quality of life of pregnant women
Sexual and domestic violence was linked to a lower
quality of life as well as the experience of
life threatening events and the experience of infertility
Happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic were
factors related to a better quality of life
Discussion
Summary of results
Pregnant women especially during the third trimester
had significantly lower quality of life scores than
non pregnant women of the same age Physically the
quality of life decreased significantly during the course
of the trimesters On a psychological level several stud
ies reported an increase in quality of life relative to men
tal health during pregnancy and in others psychological
stability was seen Many factors were associated with the
quality of life in pregnant women Some factors associ
ated with higher well being were socio demographic
first time pregnancy a favourable socio economic sta
tus social support partner support Similarly the desire
Page of
to be pregnant and moderate physical activity were fac
tors associated with a positive quality of life A lesser
quality of life was attributed to physical factors such as
complications during pregnancy medically assisted
reproduction obesity prior to conception physical
symptoms such as nausea and vomiting sleep difficul
ties and otherwise attributed to psychological factors
such as anxiety and stress during pregnancy and de
pressive symptoms
Strengths and limitations of the study
To our knowledge this is the only systematic review of
international literature aimed at synthesizing data re
garding the quality of life of pregnant women Many fac
tors have been studied considering the different
dimensions of the quality of life for pregnant women in
general good health This work also has its limitations
the research only included articles written in English or
French Therefore the issue of generalizability should be
discussed In addition two other articles could not be
read in their entirety Within the selected studies few
studies were multi centric and only one study used in
formation from a large national survey In addition we
found a high degree of heterogeneity in the methodology
for population selection in choosing the quality of life
scale as well as in the results presented dimensions of
SF composite scores etc complicating the synthesis
study Specific HRQOL questionnaires were not in
cluded because they are focused more on specific prob
lems in pregnancy such as nausea and vomiting rather
than on women s overall well being and their quality of
life With regard to the quality of these studies three
studies did not explicitly take into account the con
founding factors in the presentation of the results
which may lead to confusion bias In addition a
large number of studies were cross sectional These
studies did not establish an associative cause and effect
relationship
Research and policy implications
In some countries the quality of life of pregnant woman
has been little studied In France for example only one
study provided information on pregnant women
well being study not included in our analysis cf
exclusion criteria In this study the mental health of
pregnant women was measured through the following
question On a psychological level how did you feel
during your pregnancy Well Quite well Quite poor
Poor Of the women interviewed reported
poor self rated mental health during pregnancy More
over sociodemographic characteristics indicative of so
Cial disadvantage were associated with a higher risk of
poor quality of life sometimes a social gradient was ob
served Since SF is a generic scale it allows

comparisons with chronic pathologies such as diabetes
The results obtained concerning physical activity and
pain in pregnant women can be compared to those ob
tained for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular dis
eases diabetes and cancer A study by Sprangers et
al in found an average value of in the Physical
Functions and in the Bodily Pain categories con
cerning diabetic patients In comparison we found
values between and for Physical Functions and
between and for Bodily Pain in pregnant women
Moreover quality of life refers to subjective elements
that may vary from one culture to another In the Coban
et al study undertaken in three countries over three
continents China Ghana USA the subjective con
cepts of well being or vitality were perceived and
measured in very different ways on the three continents
This study did not focus on the quality of life of fathers
According to the Abassi et al study the quality of life of
fathers was significantly higher during pregnancy and
postpartum than that of their partner Specifically
their physical quality of life was significantly higher
Their mental quality of life was close and there was no
significant difference between them and their partner in
two studies where this was studied Finally we
believe that it is necessary to systematically screen
women having a poor quality of life during pregnancy
Studies have to determine whether a single question is
sufficient in clinical practice or whether it is preferable
to have a more specific questionnaire before the
follow up consultation
Conclusions
Health related quality of life refers to the subjective as
sessment of patients regarding the physical mental and
social dimensions of well being Women s subjective per
ception of their health related quality of life is an essen
tial measure of the quality and effectiveness of maternal
and child health interventions However few women
less than speak spontaneously about their
psychological ill health to a health professional Health
authorities recommendations are needed to better de
tect a poor quality of life of pregnant women and to
evaluate the impact of care in terms of quality of life of
pregnant women Then given the diversity of factors as
sociated with the quality of life the medical and para
medical professions need to work in cohesion with
social agencies networks and associations

Severity of excessive gestational weight gain and risk
of severe maternal morbidity

A Check for updates
BACKGROUND Both obesity and excessive gestational weight gain
are associated with severe maternal morbidity but there is limited litera
ture evaluating whether the risk of severe maternal morbidity is further
increased by the degree or severity of excessive gestational weight gain
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine whether pregnant patients
with excessive gestational weight gain who gained more than lb were
at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity compared with those who
only moderately exceeded recommended gestational weight gain guide
lines A secondary objective was to determine whether patients who
gained lb more than the recommended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy body mass index group were at increased risk of
severe maternal morbidity compared with those who exceeded that upper
limit by a lesser amount
STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients
with live term singleton deliveries with excessive gestational weight gain
from hospitals within a large health system in New York between Janu
ary and February Excessive gestational weight gain was
defined as exceeding the recommended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy body mass index category using the National
Academy of Medicine gestational weight gain guidelines lb for a
body mass index of kg lb for a body mass index of
to kg lb for a body mass index of to kg and
lb for a body mass index of kg Patient height and weight
data were self repotted at the time of delivery hospitalization and retrieved
from the electronic medical record system Patients were classified into
excessive gestational weight gain groups moderate lb or severe
lb Patients with missing body mass index or gestational weight
gain were excluded The primary exposure was severe excessive gesta
tional weight gain The primary outcome was severe maternal morbidity
defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria
Logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of severe maternal
morbidity adjusting for race and ethnicity nulliparity advanced maternal
age gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal mood disorder For the
secondary analysis severe maternal morbidity rates were compared
between patients who exceeded their body mass index specific upper
limit of total weight gain by lb and those who exceeded it by lb
RESULTS A total of patients were included for analysis and
patients had severe excessive gestational weight gain The
overall rate of severe maternal morbidity was Severe maternal mor
bidity occurred in of patients with severe excessive gesta
tional weight gain and of patients with moderate
excessive gestational weight gain On regression analysis after adjust
ment for covariate factors patients with a severe excessive gestational
weight gain were more likely to experience severe maternal morbidity
than those with moderate excessive gestational weight gain adjusted odds
ratio confidence interval Patients with excessive
gestational weight gain of lb above the recommended body mass
index specific upper limit for gestational weight gain were more
likely adjusted odds ratio confidence interval to
experience severe maternal morbidity than patients who exceeded that
upper limit by lb
CONCLUSION Patients with live term singleton pregnancies who
gain more than lb are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity
compared with those who only moderately exceed gestational weight gain
guidelines Similarly patients who gain lb above the recommended
body mass index specific upper limit for gestational weight gain are at
increased risk Further study is warranted to determine the most effective
intetwentions to manage gestational weight gain and mitigate maternal
risk

the rate is much higher in populations
with more maternal comorbidities
Obesity is the most common comorbid
ity in reproductive age women and it is
a known risk factor for several other
medical comorbidities According to the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven
tion CDC of pregnant women in
the United States are obese before preg
nancy There is a well established asso
ciation between obesity and SMM In
addition previous studies have demon
strated that pregnant patients who
exceed gestational weight gain GWG
guidelines are at increased risk of SMM
compared with those who do not
However based on our review of the lit
erature few studies have evaluated
whether the risk of SMM is further
increased by the degree or severity of
excessive GWG EGWG
The most widely accepted GWG
guidelines are those published in
by the Institute of Medicine
now known as the National Academy of
Medicine Recommendations are pro
vided on the basis of prepregnancy
body mass index BMI classification
Thus EGWG is not defined by a single
threshold but rather by specific criteria

Why was this study conducted
Previous studies have shown that pregnant patients who exceed gestational
weight gain GWG guidelines are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity
SMM compared with those who do not However based on our review of the
literature few studies have evaluated whether the risk of SMM is further
increased by the degree or severity of excessive GWG EGWG
Key findings
In this retrospective cohort study of patients with EGWG those who
gained lb severe EGWG were more likely to experience SMM than
those who gained lb moderate EGWG after adjustment for covariate fac
tors adjusted odds ratio confidence interval
What does this add to what is known
Among pregnancies affected by EGWG the degree or severity of EGWG is posi
tively associated with a risk of SMM
pregnancies the upper limits of recom
mended GWG vary from to lb for
patients with obesity BMI of kg
and patients who are underweight
BMI of kg respectively
This study aimed to evaluate how the
severity of EGWG is associated with
SMM To provide more interpretable
and generalizable information we
assessed an arbitrary threshold of exces
siveness that could be applied across all
BMI groups one that was lb above
the upper limit of the highest recom
mended GWG of any prepregnancy
BMI group in the guidelines ie
lb for women who are underweight
Specifically our primary objective was
to determine whether pregnant patients
who gain more than lb severe
EGWG are at higher risk of SMM than
those who only moderately exceed rec
ommended guidelines lb We
hypothesized that patients who gained
more than lb would be at increased
risk of SMM compared with those who
did not A secondary objective was to
determine whether patients who gained
lb more than the recommended
upper limit of total weight gain for a
given BMI group were at increased risk
of SMM compared with those who
exceeded that upper limit but by lb
Materials and Methods
This retrospective cohort study evalu
ated all patients with live singleton
term deliveries with EGWG from
AJOG MFM January
hospitals within a large health system in
New York between January and
February A term delivery was
defined as occurring between
and weeks of gestation EGWG
was defined as exceeding the recom
mended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy BMI category
using the GWG guidelines lb
for patients who are underweight BMI
of kg lb for patients
with a normal weight BMI of
kg lb for patients who
are overweight BMI of kg
and lb for patients with obe
sity BMI of kg Patient
height and weight data were self
reported at the time of delivery hospital
ization and retrieved from the electronic
medical record EMR system this
included both prepregnancy and deliv
ery values Outpatient prenatal records
were not reviewed for this study because
of inconsistent access and availability

known
Previous studies have investigated
maternal outcomes associated with
EGWG There is an association between
EGWG and gestational diabetes melli

Some
studies have evaluated the association
between EGWG and SMM and at

in this study By evaluating a uniform
definition of severe EGWG lb
one that does not differ by prepreg

associated with a greater degree of
GWG The authors compared the out
comes among groups below within
to lb above and lb above
GWG guidelines based on prepreg

evaluated some severe maternal out
comes it did not comprehensively eval
uate all SMM outcomes Leonard et al
evaluated the association between
AJOG MFM January
GWG and SMM using the CDC crite
ria across each BMI group and con
cluded that higher GWG correlated
with increased risk of SMM but with
differential effects based on the prepreg
nancy BMI group In our study we
observed that patients with a GWG of
lb severe EGWG were at a higher
risk of SMM than those with a GWG of
lb moderate EGWG
Clinical implications
Severe EGWG is a modifiable clinical
risk factor for SMM Based on our find
ings patients with EGWG should
receive counseling about their increased
risk and early intervention and man
agement strategies should be imple
mented to reduce the likelihood of
adverse outcomes All pregnant patients
should track weight gain consume bal
anced diets avoid highly processed
foods and engage in moderate intensity
aerobic exercise Additional strategies
are warranted for patients who exceed
GWG guidelines and for those at the
highest risk of doing so such as those
with mood disorders
For these
patients at increased risk nutrition
counseling by registered dietitians may
increase adherence to dietary recom
mendations
Research implications
Although SMM was increased in the
group with severe EGWG we were
unable to detect a difference in the fre
quency of individual SMM indicators
eg blood transfusion between study
groups Based on our sample size it is
not certain whether the increase is
attributable to specific SMM indicators
or increased uniformly across all SMM
indicators Larger samples or popula
tion based studies may provide more
insight Moreover it is possible that the
effect of severe EGWG on SMM may be
modified by the presence or absence of
intermediate outcomes For example
many but not all pregnancies with
severe EGWG will be complicated by
macrosomia this fetal complication
increases the risk of postpartum hemor
rhage because of overdistention of the
uterus which may lead to a blood trans
fusion the most common form of
SMM Mediation analysis can be per
formed to better understand the under
lying mechanism or process by which
severe EGWG influences SMM risk
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths The
patient population is diverse resides in
both urban and suburban communities
and spans the socioeconomic spectrum

Conclusions
Patients with live term singleton preg

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective To explore work arounds at faith based obstetrics and gynecology residency programs to ac
complish family planning training
Study design We invited educational stakeholders to participate in telephone interviews that elicited
strategies for overcoming barriers to family planning training in religious settings
Results Eighteen out of invited programs leaders participated Work arounds included reliance on
non contraceptive indications for contraception and permanent contraception provision obtaining ethics
committee approvals for service provision and developing partnerships with offsite centers for training
Conclusion Ob gyn residency programs affiliated with religious hospitals utilize various work arounds
for family planning training and patient care These findings may inform other programs that face similar
barriers secondary to institutional or governmental restrictions

Catholic facilities are expected to follow institutional guide
lines set forth by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops known
as the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Ser
vices The Directives prohibit most reproductive services includ
ing contraception permanent contraception and abortion based
on their belief that sexual intercourse is reserved for the inten
tion of procreation and that life begins at conception
Recent
evidence demonstrates that non Catholic faith based hospitals also
face restrictions to abortion provision
As Roe v Wade is now
overturned many states are facing new regulations to abortion
provision
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
ACGME mandates comprehensive family planning education in
cluding abortion training at all obstetrics and gynecology ob
gyn programs regardless of institutional filiation with the abil
ity of individual residents to opt out based on personal or moral
Program leaders at religious hospitals particularly

Catholic sites have historically faced the challenge of providing
comprehensive family planning training while adhering to institu
tional guidelines In this study we sought to explore the barriers
that program leaders face and the strategies used to accomplish
comprehensive family planning training at faith based hospitals in
the form of work arounds
Materials and methods
We previously identified ob gyn residency programs in
which at least of resident time was spent at a Catholic or
other faith based hospital that prohibited reproductive services
and invited them to participate in an online survey study
These programs accounted for of the ACGME accredited
ob gyn residency programs in and are responsible for
approximately graduating residents each year In this study
the senior author invited the educational stakeholders mainly
program directors who responded to the original online survey
and expressed a willingness to participate in a follow up to
minute telephone interview We offered a gift card as
remuneration
Our telephone interviews explored onsite strategies offsite col
laborations ongoing barriers and respondents understanding of
institutional and educational requirements The senior investiga
tor MG conducted all interviews informed survey respondents
that participation was voluntary and any personal or institutional

names would be deidentified during analysis After full disclosures
we obtained oral consent We chose to write notes rather than
audio record given the sensitive nature of this study and partici
pant concerns for employment repercussions
To identify common work arounds and strategies investiga
tors performed directed content analysis of interview notes We
received exemption approval from the Colorado Multiple Institu
tional Review Board based on the deidentified nature minimal risk
to participants and exclusion of personal health information
Results
Eighteen of the ob gyn program leaders that primarily
train residents at a religious hospital completed the telephone in
terview of the participants were based at Catholic sites
Respondents included program directors one department
chair and one faculty attending tasked with family planning ed
ucation Seventeen interviews occurred between March and
November with one additional in April We considered
a lack of response to the interview invitation correspondence as
refusal to participate in the study
Many participants used online trainings and simulation for fam
ily planning procedures for contraception permanent contracep
tion and abortion care Table
presents key findings of the work
arounds reported by interviewed stakeholders organized by fam
ily planning method We did not detect contraception or perma
nent contraception training concerns among the eight non Catholic
faith based programs during interviews Respondents who previ
ously received Residency Review Committee RCC citations for in
adequate training explained how these citations were helpful as
they often provided leverage to improve training
Discussion
We found varying ways in which religious ob gyn residency
programs accomplished family planning training The extent to
which contraception and permanent contraception provision oc
curred onsite at Catholic facilities was often dependent on lo
cal interpretations of the directives and acceptance of work
arounds Regarding abortion training offsite collaborations were
most often employed as suffcient onsite training was not possi
ble at all the religious hospital sites Local factors including fac
ulty leaders state settings and malpractice concerns served as
modifiers to how feasible or successful community partnerships
occurred
In recent years of all U S ob gyn residency program di
rectors have cited some sort of institutional or governmental re
striction that interferes with abortion training With the fall
of Roe states may ban abortion potentially eliminating train
ing for almost half of U S ob gyn residency programs
This will cause a detrimental impact on the training of of
the total ob gyn residents in the U S
To continue com
prehensive training of future ob gyn physicians educational lead
ers will have to prepare for a changing and more restrictive envi
ronment Strategies employed by our respondents may guide such
ob gyn programs and those at religious settings that are transition
ing from osteopathic to ACGME accreditation status Our work may
also aid residency programs of other specialties that train physi
cians in family planning services including family medicine inter
nal medicine and pediatrics
Due to the nature of an interview study our findings were
limited by participation bias It is possible that respondents were
more likely to have strong opinions about abortion training in their
programs than those who did not participate We deliberately took
notes instead of audio recordings so that respondents would feel

more comfortable sharing their insights however some informa

sented primarily qualitative over quantitative data to provide the
most insight and guidance for future application Strengths of our
study include that the interviews were open ended both first and
senior authors trained and worked in a religious setting so were
knowledgeable on the topic and the senior author conducted all
interviews for consistency
The extent to which religious programs employed work arounds
reduced the need to seek offsite collaborations While this resulted
in improved training experiences this finding reemphasizes the
moral and clinical ambiguities that occur when Catholic programs
attempt to balance the directives and accreditation requirements
simultaneously These findings also highlight the varying de

BACKGROUND The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine uses social
media to increase awareness of the Society and its key programs and to
foster community and discussion around perinatal health especially on
Twitter The influence and role of the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Twitter account in public discourse around issues relevant to pregnancy
have not been studied
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the trends in engagement
with the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine on Twitter by analyzing Soci
ety for Maternal Fetal Medicine follower growth and discussion topics on
Twitter compared with Facebook and by quantifying public engagement
during the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting
STUDY DESIGN This retrospective study analyzed follower growth data
from August to July for the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Twitter MySMFM and Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Facebook
SocietyforMaternalFetalMedicine accounts We identified the top
tweets and Facebook posts during the study period using Twitter Analytics
and Facebook data The popularity of tweets and Facebook posts was deter
mined by impressions and reach respectively these metrics reflect the
number of times a post was viewed To evaluate annual trends in Society
for Maternal Fetal Medicine Twitter engagement we analyzed data associ
ated with the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meet
ing including the number of tweets using the hashtag SMFM Year and
overall impressions for the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Twitter
RESULTS The absolute number of new followers for the Society for
Maternal Fetal Medicine Twitter and Facebook accounts was similar
but the relative increase and rate of follower growth was higher for
Twitter than for Facebook The Twitter account consistently gained fol
lowers whereas the Facebook account experienced intermittent peri
ods of stagnancy or follower loss More than half of the top ranked
posts on Twitter and Facebook mentioned the COVID vaccine other
popular topics included COVID and abortion During the Society for
Maternal Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting the number of
tweets using the meeting hashtag consistently peaked on meeting day
coincident with the opening plenary session mean An
upward trend in annual pregnancy meeting tweets was observed each
year until the first virtual Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
meeting
CONCLUSION The trends in Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Twitter engagement suggest increasing use and popularity of the platform
for timely dissemination of pregnancy related news guidelines and
research The reduction in annual pregnancy meeting tweets and impres
sions in and suggests the potential negative effect of villual
meetings on Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine member engagement

AJOG MFM at a Glance
Why was this study conducted
The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine SMFM uses social media to increase
awareness of the society its members and its key programs This study aimed to
evaluate the trends in engagement with SMFM on Twitter and Facebook
Key findings
The SMFM Twitter account following has grown steadily over the past years at
a faster rate than Facebook COVID related posts garnered the most engage
ment on both platforms throughout the study
What does this add to what is known
Social media engagement around the SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meeting
increased annually until and when the meeting was held virtually
Our findings suggest that Twitter is an important tool for real time dissemina
tion and discussion of pregnancy related research
study quantified trends in engagement
with the SMFM around SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting by examining the
usage of the meeting hashtag during the
weeks surrounding the conference We
predicted that growth in SMFM Twitter
followers would surpass the rate of
growth for Facebook and that the virtual
format of the annual pregnancy meeting
in and would result in an
increase in meeting related tweets
Materials and Methods
Study design
This descriptive retrospective study
used SMFM Twitter and Facebook

AJOG MFM November
Content data
The top SMFM posts on Twitter and
Facebook January to July
were identified using platform specific
metrics For Twitter popular posts were
determined by the number of impres
sions Impressions are defined as the
total number of times a tweet appears
on a timeline or search result Post
impressions reflect the level of expo
sure to content which has been found
to be a more significant predictor of
post influence than the number of likes
comments or retweets of each post
For Facebook top posts were deter
mined using SMFM s Facebook account
Insights part of the normal Facebook
analytical data The posts were ranked
by reach or the number of people who
saw the SMFM posts at least once Simi
lar to Twitter impressions Facebook s
reach data reflect exposure to content
Post categories were determined by
identifying common terms or hashtags
used in the top ranked posts for each
platform
Twitter engagement during the
Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Annual Pregnancy Meeting
We quantified SMFM meeting related
Tweets around the annual pregnancy
meeting to evaluate the level of social
media engagement during a period when
member engagement is anticipated to be
high We used the social media analyt
ics platform Sprout Social to identify
the number of daily tweets containing
the meeting hashtag SMFMYY or
SMFMYYYY around the time of the
annual pregnancy meeting for each
meeting from to We exam
ined a week timeframe from week
before day of the meeting to week
after day to capture the period when
the use of the meeting hashtag is
expected to be the highest Sprout Social
is a comprehensive social media man
agement platform that tracks the total
number of tweets engagements and
more over time to provide insights into
online engagement To estimate the
audience of the MySMFM Twitter
account during the same period we used
Twitter Analytics to collect data on the
total number of MySMFM tweet
impressions We compared these data
with the total volume of meeting related
tweets collected via Sprout Social during
the same period
Data analysis and statistics
Trends in follower growth were deter
mined using a linear regression model
and the slopes for Twitter and Facebook
growth from to were com
pared The number of SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting related tweets was
calculated for each day of the confer
ence from to To determine
trends in Twitter activity we compared
the total number of tweets and impres
sions from day to day of the annual
pregnancy meeting for each year The
total number of impressions was nor
malized to the total number of tweets
given an expected proportional relation
ship between the variables Data
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
version GraphPad Software La
Jolla CA
Results
At the beginning of the study period
the SMFM Twitter account had
followers whereas the Facebook
account had followers Between
August and July the number
of followers gained was slightly higher
for Twitter for Twitter vs
for Facebook This growth translated
to a relative increase of for Twitter
followers compared with for Face
book followers although the Facebook
account had more followers overall
for Facebook vs for
Twitter The rate of follower growth
was higher for Twitter slope for
Twitter vs for Facebook Figure I
Although Twitter followers increased
continuously for the entire study period
Facebook follower growth varied Sur
prisingly the Facebook page experi
enced a net loss of followers during
month November By compari
son SMFM society membership grew
from January to January
To identify the content that garnered
the most attention and engagement on
SMFM Twitter and Facebook we ana
lyzed the top posts on each platform
The most popular SMFM Twitter and
Facebook discussion topics were related
to the COVID pandemic Table
The topics identified were COVID
vaccines COVID abortion and
other all posts that did not fit into the
other categories COVID or the
COVID vaccine were the focus of
of the top tweets and of the top
Facebook posts
Next we evaluated social media
engagement around the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting Tweets using the
SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meeting
hashtag increased between days and
peak and were the highest on days
and corresponding to the main ple
nary sessions Figure A On average
there was almost a fold increase in
meeting related tweets between days
FIGURE
and eg during the SMFM
Annual Pregnancy Meeting there were
tweets on day compared with
tweets on day representing a
fold increase in tweets The number of
daily tweets during the meeting
increased markedly in compared
with vs on day but
then decreased in n the
first meeting ever held virtually because
of the COVID pandemic Day
tweet volume increased in
n virtual meeting and
n in person meeting but did
not recover to levels
Contrary to our hypothesis that the
virtual meeting format would increase
social media use approximately half as
many total meeting related tweets were
posted during the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting compared with the
SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meet
ing vs respectively Despite
the drop in tweet volume in over
all impressions that year were higher
vs in
Figure
B This finding reflects the multiple
variables that affect impressions such
as number of retweets likes and com
ments and who is engaging with the
content In the second virtual
meeting and in person meeting
there was a slight increase in the volume
of meeting related tweets and
respectively By comparison the

registration
Comment
Principal findings
Our study evaluated trends in SMFM
social media growth and engagement
using Twitter and Facebook data We
found that SMFM Twitter follower
growth has surpassed Facebook follower
growth in recent years the most
popular content on both platforms
mentioned the COVID vaccine or
other COVID related topics and
tweets during the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting increased annually
until the shift to a virtual meeting for
mat in
Results in the context of what is
known
The finding that SMFM Twitter growth
has surpassed SMFM Facebook growth
since is not unexpected given the
ever changing landscape of social media
and the influence of demographic dif
ferences on platform preference and
usage Fluctuations in the popularity
of different social media platforms are
inevitable thus staying up to date with
social media trends is an important
component of an effective communica
tions strategy
Our observation that COVID vac
cine and disease related posts were
the most shared and seen content on
both platforms is evidence that social
media can effectively amplify crucial
and timely health information A recent
analysis of COVID related Twitter
discussions found that of message
functions information community
and action engagement through
retweets was most common with Tweets
that promoted action This trend was
also seen in the SMFM Twitter account
as the most popular tweet encouraged
pregnant people to get vaccinated In
addition the social isolation of the pan
demic increased reliance on social
media updates as a primary news

ABSTRACT
Background India has around high risk pregnant mothers which leads to about perinatal morbidities l The early prediction
of a high risk pregnancy and planning interventions can help in preventing complications and result in good pregnancy outcomes
Aims To study the pregnancy outcome among the high risk pregnant women of a rural area and to associate pregnancy outcomes
of high risk pregnant women with modified Coopland s criteria Material and Methods Study design I year Longitudinal study
from to Study population The high risk pregnant women attending PMSMA camp Study area Kinaye Primary Health
Centre Belagavi Sample size Data collection was done using a pretested predesigned questionnaire after obtaimng patient
consent and ethical clearance Chi square test was used to study the association of variables and categorical data presented as
percentages Results Among the participants of the pregnant women had low risk scores had high risk scores and
had severe risk scores according to Coopland s high risk pregnancy scoring Nearly high risk pregnancies resulted in
bad fetal outcomes As Coopland s score in the high risk group increased the chance of having good fetal outcomes decreased
and this association was found to be statistically significant Conclusions of the high risk mothers had good pregnancy
outcomes The scoring system can be used by health workers for the prediction of high risk pregnancy and plan treatment and
preventive measures
Keywords Belagavi High risk PMSMA pregnancy outcome
Introduction
High risk pregnancy H R P is defined as one which is
complicated by factor or factors that adversely affect the
pregnancy outcome maternal perinatal or both Identification
of such pregnancies which lead to poor outcome is the primary
aim in antenatal care A risk scoring system is very useful for
the detection of HRP as it often results in a bad maternal
and fetal outcome and extra care should be given especially

in developing countries like India Early prediction of such a
state severity and planning interventions can help in preventing
complications and thus reduce the maternal and infant mortality
rates and the incidence of low birth weight babies The Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare of India launched the Pradhan
Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan PMSMA in to provide
quality antenatal care services free of cost to all women in their
or trimesters of pregnancy at certain government health
facilities on the of every month This helps us in identifying
and tracking high risk pregnancies monthly antenatal checkups
by a specialist and treatment of complicated cases at all the
health centres thereby making the antenatal services more
approachable to all the pregnant women in all places including
the remote areas and rural places thus helping every mother
and child to have a safe delivery and healthy life by preventing

Regarding pregnancy outcome there were total of newborns
three abortions and two twin deliveries among whom
were male and were female The mode of delivery was
normal vaginal for pregnant women and Caesarean for
Most of the mothers preferred private
hospitals for delivery whereas preferred Government
hospitals and one of them had home delivery
Comparison of pregnancy outcome of the high
risk pregnancies had good a fetal outcome and had
bad outcomes
Full term vaginal delivery with single live birth with an immediate
cry and normal weight without complications was considered
a good outcome There were total bad fetal outcomes as
shown in Figure
The majority of the good fetal outcomes
were seen in the low risk group followed by the high risk
The association between the pregnancy risk
group and the fetal outcome was found to be statistically
significant P Table
Various steps were taken by the health workers to identify
at risk pregnant mothers and provide timely adequate treatment
affecting the overall pregnancy outcome Some of the preventive
practices are as shown in Figure
Discussion
In the present study the majority of the mothers were in
the age group of to years years were
of the participant was the elderly primigravida In a similar study
conducted in central India among women the majority of
the mothers were in the age group of to years while
the remaining were in the age group of or years
In another study done in Nagpur were in the age
group of to years and were teenagers In
our study of the study participants had child marriage
and nearly of the mothers were aged below years at the
time of the ISt pregnancy In a similar study of Belagavi more
than of the participants had child marriage and of
their age at first pregnancy was years lll According to the
National Family Health Survey NFHS
of the women population have child marriage and of the
pregnancies are years In this study of the study
participant belonged to the class IV socioeconomic status
followed by class III and only belonged to the
Table Coopland s risk scoring and pregnancy outcome
class I whereas in another study conducted in Kinaye about
belonged to IV socioeconomic class followed by III
and least belonged to class according to modified B G
Prasad s classification ll In the present study around of
the mothers were literate A similar study done in a rural area of
Nagpur showed that were literate
In our study of the women had a normal BMI
were underweight overweight preobese

woman s reproductive system is complex and delicate which
makes it particularly vulnerable to dysfunction or disease

causes a number of side effects but the researchers hoped their
approach would prevent this altogether In tissue culture they
were able to successfully guide the sperm using a magnet toward
the tumor where they then freed the sperm cells to deliver the
drug locally Figure
While these experiments are still being performed in the lab
Medina believes that it would eventually be possible to
deliver these types of engineered therapies to patients She and
her colleagues are still improving how the sperm is guided to
the target tissues In practice a patient s physician or another
medical expert would be responsible for guiding the sperm And
because it s conceivable that the sperm could perform its natu
ral function and fuse with oocytes Medina believes it
would be possible to treat a woman when she s not ovulating
Looking forward she and her colleagues are hoping to use the
same robotic sperm technology to treat ectopic pregnancies and
abnormalities in the epithelium of the uterus
Although it s currently unknown which technologies and
methods of drug delivery will be approved and widely used in the
future researchers are investigating myriad methods Women

not everyone likes to take an oral contraceptive Not everyone
wants a ring I think to be successful in developing new meth

facilitates the exarnination of the impact of
low educational attainment in isolation from
the influence of young matemal age
Parity was determined by the number of
previous live births Having children at home
may represent a potential barrier to care
owing to child care concerns High parity for
age was defined as or more previous births
for adolescents or more previous births for
mothers aged to years or more pre
vious births for mothers aged to years

aged years and older
Chi square analyses were used to test for
differences in the proportion of maternal risk
among ethnic goups Owing to
the large number of cases in frie data file
most comparisons would be anticipated to be
statistically significant Logistic regression anal

effects of sociodemographic characterisfics on
prenatal care use Three separate models were
run The first model compared the receipt of
no prenatal care wiffl the receipt of any prena

INTRODUCTION
Touching with nature could contribute to the
development of children s positive emotions including
increased self confidence promoting peer social relations
and racial integration and to enhance the relationship
between teachers and students Crompton Sellar
and to reduce anger and aggression Ulrich Kaplan
and Kaplan Harting et al Brown Odom
Conroy also pointed out that doing activities in the
natural environment for handicapped children could
contribute to the development of their interpersonal
relationships
Generally there are some problems on communication
and interaction behavior for children with autism When
they face to inhuman things such as nature the children
with autism often become more comfortable The teaching
method on autism children emphasizes multisensory Wang
and the experience of touching nature would be the
original and appropriate way
The objects of this study were year old children with
autism and would explore the relationship between nature
experience activities with their development of multiple
intelligences For autistic children they often have some
cognitive sensory emotional and social interaction
problems and it could be stimulated sensory sense through
the experience of contact with nature
METHODS
A Research Objects
The object of this study was one NGO Foundation
special class for children with autism There were
in class and of which four mild autism and for the
moderate autism
B About team teaching teachers
This study was designed on theme courses by the
original class and we tried to involved nature experience
activities into lesson plan content We discussed lesson
amendments with team teaching teacher and the class was
leading the activities by them
C Nature experience activities design
Nature experience activities were designed in accordance
with original theme and integrated with natural materials
such as natural adventure treasure hunt collect leaves
twigs or other natural objects trunk rubbing grass skiing
on coconut leaves imitated small ants crawling roll in the
grass We implemented the curriculum in adjacent park
and the implementation time of IOctober to December
every Thursday morning to OO
D Data collection
This study used participant observation to collect the
change of status of the multiple intelligences of children
before and after each class The scales of multiple
intelligences were assessed by researchers team teaching
teachers as well as Occupational Therapist in accordance
with the status of children on activities The multiple
intelligences scales were modified by each activity
including before and after assessment comprehensive
assessment and special event records
E Analysis methods
The analysis methods were used by descriptive statistical
analysis and paired t test to analyze the difference of the
multiple intelligences and observation records were
extracted and summarized the related conditions of children
in various intelligence activities
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A The linguistic intelligence
In linguistic intelligence it was found significant
differences between before and after activity by paired
t test From Figure I we could see there was no consistency
trend on before and after score of first children but the
score of after activity higher than before for the second and
third child Therefore it was increased on linguistic
intelligence

In addition it was found that children in the nature were
proactive attentiveness than indoor course from the
observation records even for easily distracted children
After the teacher explained most of them could perform
activities in accordance with instructions especially some
activities children more interested in such as pushing ball
looking for natural objects
B The logical intelligence
In logical part there were significant differences of the
two children before and after the activity by paired t test
From Figure there was no difference at four times before
and after scores for first child but the score of after activity
all higher than before for the third child So it was found
two trends were enhanced and another less obvious on
logical intelligence In addition activities associated with
the logical intelligence all could be completed for children
from observation records
D The body intelligence
There was significant differences just on one child before
and after the activity by paired t test in body intelligence
From Figure there was no difference at before and after
scores for the second and third child but the score of after
activity higher than before for the first child So it was
found one was enhanced and another two less obvious on
body intelligence Children could put in activities happily
about body activities such as pushing balls grass skiing
rolling body creeping forward

intelligence From Figure there was no difference at
before and after scores for the second child but the score of
after activity all higher than before for the first and third
child So it was found two trends were enhanced and
another less obvious on spatial intelligence In addition
children could perform well at activities about spatial
intelligence such as finding trees picking up nature
objects

In fact activities with touching nature were excluded by
some children at beginning but they accepted quickly This
is difficult to do for children with autism Moreover
touching different nature materials could usefully reduce
their tactile sensitivity
E The musical intelligence
There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t test in musical
intelligence From Figure there was no difference at
before and after scores for the second child but the score of
after activity was little higher than before for the first and
the after score was obviously higher than before for the
third child So it was found two trends were enhanced and
another less obvious on musical intelligence In addition
children actively participate in activities and nature
experience activities stimulate children to opening their
mouth to sing from observation records

There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t test in interpersonal
intelligence From Figure there was no difference at
before and after scores for the first child but the score of
after activity was obvious difference than before for the
second and third child So it was found two trends were
enhanced and another less obvious on interpersonal
intelligence The nature experience activities were helpful
for children with well order and learning waiting

In Self reflection intelligence it was found significant
differences between before and after activity by paired

before for the third child Therefore it was increased on
self reflection intelligence The emotion of children was
reflected when they contact with nature at beginning They
were gradually concentrated on the activity in nature and
more stable on emotion later

child was the great difference than the first one Therefore
it was increased on nature observation intelligence Natural

C
Involved with nature experience actives could
significantly enhance the development of language
self reflection and naturalist intelligence of children
with autism and also be promoted on the logical
spatial musical interpersonal intelligence But there
was no significant change on body intelligence
The nature experience activities could be exerted by
tactile sensitivity of children with autism according to
the different characteristics of them to find a suitable
stimulus or reinforcements to help the stability of their
emotion
It was found children with autism have high
acceptance for nature materials although they often
reject to touch new things Therefore the nature
experience activities integrated into the curriculum will
contribute to their learning of children with autism

P
Gender diverse individuals interested in or undecided about future parenthood were more likely to
consider cryopreservation and report inadequate family planning counseling Therefore current
counseling practices may be insufficient and referral to a fertility specialist should be considered

Literature evaluating the perceived quality
GAHT
of family planning counseling is sparse but study found
that of participants at a gender health program did
not think they received adequate information
To better describe perspectives about fertility preserva
tion and family planning in the transgender population of
the United States we surveyed adults and youth pursuing
GAHT at an endocrinology clinic about fertility related
care We assessed desires for future parenthood and
obstacles to parenthood Furthermore we evaluated for
the presence and adequacy of family planning counseling
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This cross sectional survey study utilized an anonymous non val
idated online survey built on the REDCap electronic data cap
ture platform The study was conducted at a single academic
medical center in the adult and pediatric endocrinology clinics
Individuals referred to these clinics between February and
May for GAHT were screened for eligibility Only individ
uals no older than years of age were eligible for participation
Individuals unable to provide informed consent and vulnerable
populations were excluded This study was reviewed and
approved by an Institutional Review Board
Participant recruitment and informed consent occurred in
person during a clinic visit or post hoc via telephone only for
adults At the conclusion of a clinic visit or after conclusion
for telephone recruitment eligible individuals were offered the
opportunity to participate Informed consent to use de identified
data was verbal for adults and written for youth Participants
were then given a QR code and or emailed a link to the RED
Cap survey The survey was completed at a time and location
convenient to the participant
The REDCap survey was divided into sections demo
graphics family planning and fertility preservation We
included a screening question to ensure the survey was not com
pleted more than once by a single individual In the family plan
ning section we asked about current children desires for future
children and obstacles to parenthood Gender affirming care
priorities related to cryopreservation and participant experien
ces with family planning counseling were addressed in the fertil
ity preservation section The survey instrument is available as a
supplemental document
Our primary measures of interest were the desire for future
parenthood and interest in fertility preservation among transgen
der individuals In addition we assessed obstacles to future par
enthood and the adequacy of family planning counseling in this
cohort Survey responses were compared according to age group
sex assigned at birth and self described parental desire Descrip
tive statistics were ca culated for continuous variables Univari
ate t tests were used to analyze continuous data and chi square
tests of independence were used for categorical data Missing
data points were excluded from analyses All statistical analyses
were completed using SPSS software IBM SPSS Armonk

found that transgender individuals with strong or uncer

participants completed cryopreservation Our findings add
to the ongoing characterization of family planning desires
among transgender persons Importantly we demon
strated that many gender diverse people of reproductive
age are undecided about future parenthood while pursuing
GAHT and would benefit from further counseling

related child was important to of participants similar
to prior studies All respondents who placed importance
in a future biologically related child were adults consis
tent with recent observations that biologically related
children may not be important to transgender youth
Adoption appears to be the preferred alternative with
more than of respondents endorsing it in this study
and the existing literature
Furthermore there was sig
nificant variability in desire for a biologically related child
depending on parenting intentions among unde
cided and interested vs among not interested This
is particularly important given evidence for the fertility
impact of GAHT and our finding that one third of indi
viduals presenting for GAHT have not solidified their
intentions for future children
While of respondents in our study considered gam
ete cryopreservation less than either planned to pur
sue or previously completed fertility preservation As
expected participants who expressed strong or uncertain
parental desire were much more likely to consider cryo
preservation compared with those not interested
in parenthood Importantly they did not pursue or com
plete fertility preservation at statistically significant higher
rates Our results are consistent with other published
results study found that of transgender men con
sidered gamete cryopreservation and another found that
of transgender women would have considered fertil
ity preservation if it had been offered In contrast rates
of cryopreservation are usually less than
Simi
larly several studies identify that less than of trans
gender youth in North America complete fertility
preservation with higher rates among transgender
Interestingly studies out of Australia and the
women
Netherlands found rates of sperm cryopreservation among
AMAB gender diverse youth between and pos
sibly related to lower costs
Cessation of GAHT is an important consideration for
gender diverse individuals pursuing cryopreservation as
the impacts on fertility potential are at least partially
reversible when stopped Prior studies indicate that stop
ping GAHT is a barrier to fertility preservation for
of transgender adults
but willingness to stop
GAHT increases with self reported parental desire
From the youth perspective only indicate willingness
to delay GAHT for fertility preservation In our study
only of respondents expressed willingness to stop
GAHT for fertility preservation however respondents
with interest in or uncertainty about future parenthood
expressed a much higher willingness and
respectively to stop hormones We also found that indi
viduals AFAB may be more willing to stop GAHT This
finding accentuates the importance of appropriately timed
counseling prior to the initiation of GAHT which would
eliminate the need to consider stopping hormone therapy
Transgender individuals include cost as a barrier to fer
tility preservation as frequently as of the
We had similar findings in our study with
time
of survey respondents citing cost as a barrier to
gamete cryopreservation and higher rates among those
with strong or uncertain parental desire Fewer respond
ents endorsed their current financial circumstance
as an obstacle to future parenthood Notably individuals
AFAB compared with AMAB were more likely to con
sider cost a barrier to fertility preservation This associa
tion did not persist when considering the financial
implications of future parenthood As such cost may
influence parental desire separate from the price of fertility
preservation Other commonly endorsed reasons that may
prevent future parenthood included lack of desire
and the complexity of the medical process with
complexity more frequently listed by individuals AFAB
Our findings corroborate the obstacles to fertility preserva
tion listed in recent studies as well as the greater influence
of medical complexity on individuals AFAB
Professional societies recommend counseling gender
diverse individuals about the fertility consequences and
family planning options prior to the initiation of
GAHT Despite universal knowledge of the potential
fertility implications of GAHT only of our cohort
reported discussing fertility preservation with a health
care provider with lower rates among youth These find
ings are consistent with counseling rates reported in the
adult and pediatric literature
they indicate an
opportunity to improve fertility counseling for gender
diverse persons Comparatively research indicates clini
cians providing transgender care perceive they perform
counseling at a higher rate While self
reported provider level barriers in that study were low
of clinicians providing transgender care
reported lack of knowledge about fertility implications
and preservation options as an impediment to well
informed discussions with patients
Few studies assess the perceived adequacy of family
planning counseling received by gender diverse individu
als In our study of respondents described counseling
as adequate described it as inadequate and
reported not receiving any counseling whatsoever Ade
quacy of counseling varied with age sex assigned at birth
and parental desire Adults reported adequate counseling
and youth reported no counseling at higher rates respec
tively AMAB individuals also reported higher rates of
adequate counseling than their AFAB counterparts Of
note AFAB individuals were younger in this study which
may explain some of this variability Perhaps most impor
tant individuals pursuing GAHT with strong or uncertain
parental desire reported significantly higher rates of inade
quate counseling These data suggest that current counsel
ing paradigms may be insufficient for those most at risk of
GAHT impacting future family planning Referring this
subset of people to a fertility specialist could improve the
counseling they receive
Our study is not without limitations It was conducted at
an academic endocrinology clinic among gender diverse per
sons of reproductive age presenting for GAHT using a non
validated survey instrument which means the results may
not be generalizable to the larger transgender population
UROLOGY
For example not all gender diverse individuals choose to
medically or surgically transition This decision could influ
ence their response to questions related to fertility related
care Furthermore our survey did not query participants who
provided counseling when that counseling occurred ie
before or after GAHT or which provider ie our institu
tion vs another institution they were considering when
answering the survey Thus our survey may reflect partici
pant perception of counseling provided by our institution
which we hypothesize may be an overestimate due to the
specialized nature of our clinic and limits measurement of
counse ing adequacy prior to initiating GAHT Furthermore
participants in this study were more insured than most
descriptive studies of transgender persons and we likely
underestimated the influence of cost on decision making As
a cross sectional survey based study the influence of response
bias must be considered Approximately of eligible peo
ple declined to participate in the study and of con
sented participants did not complete the online survey it is
difficult to predict how their responses would change the
results of this study Response bias may have also contributed
to the age difference between AMAB and AFAB individu
als Despite these limitations many of our results uphold
findings from population level studies Our findings are also
limited by a small sample size especially for transgender
youth and non binary persons This likely made our study
underpowered to highlight small to moderate differences
between these groups and the general cohort Finally due to
the cross sectional design we could not assess how responses
changed over time For example we could not measure
whether differences between youth and adults remained con
stant or narrowed as adolescents mature
CONCLUSION
Gender diverse individuals interested in or undecided
about future parenthood constitute a sizable portion of
individuals presenting for GAHT Current family plan
ning counseling practices appear to be insufficient for edu
cating and supporting transgender people undergoing
hormonal gender transition especially those interested in
future parenthood As such all persons presenting for gen
der affirming care should be queried about future parental
desire to guide clinician attention to counseling and refer
ral to fertility specialists

Abstract
BACKGROUND Almost of all pregnant women can develop potentially life threatening
complications As a result identification of high risk pregnancy at earliest stage will be useful in
directing appropriate intervention Hence the current study was done to determine the prevalence
and outcome of high risk pregnancy among antenatal women in rural Puducherry
MATERIALS AND METHODS A record based longitudinal study was done during March
among antenatal women who have attended rural health center of tertiary care institute High risk
pregnancy was classified based on the guidelines from Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan
and outcome assessment based on the obstetric and neonatal outcomes
RESULTS Among antenatal case record reviewed were in the age group of
years and majority belonged to below poverty line families registered
their current pregnancy within the first trimester The prevalence of high risk pregnancy among study
participants was confidence interval Majority had term delivery
Regarding obstetric and neonatal outcomes majority had spontaneous vaginal delivery
about gave birth to low birth weight baby and only had stillbirth Parity socioeconomic
status and unfavorable outcomes such as low birth weight preterm and postterm delivery were
associated with high risk pregnancy
CONCLUSION The current study found that almost one fifth of the pregnant women in rural area have
high risk pregnancy Unfavorable obstetric and neonatal outcomes were common among high risk
cases Hence early detection of high risk pregnancy needs to be done at primary health care level
to improve the maternal obstetric and neonatal outcomes

Majella et al Outcome of high risk pregnancy in India
as a result of complications during antenatal period
and childbirth There are five main reasons for death of
pregnant women such as severe hemorrhage maternal
infections unsafe abortion hypertension related
disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia and
eclampsia and medical complications such as cardiac
conditions HIV AIDS or diabetes complicating or
complicated by pregnancy Hence all the pregnancies
need to be evaluated for high risk pregnancy through
routine antenatal care provided by the health care
professionals
Identification of high risk pregnancy causes and its
complications through quality antenatal care helps in
achieving favorable maternal obstetric and neonatal
outcome In addition women identified to be at high
risk need to be followed up at regular intervals through
routine care by the health workers at health facility
and home visits to prevent the development of any
maternal or fetal complications Apart from follow up
care appropriate laboratory investigations and referral
services also required to improve the outcome of
pregnancy Prognosis of the outcome also depends on the
type of high risk pregnancy among pregnant mothers
Hence identification of type of high risk pregnancy at
earliest stage will be useful in directing the appropriate
intervention measures for pregnant women
Even though many studies have been done to determine
the prevalence of high risk pregnancy in India
fewer studies were done to determine the outcome
of high risk pregnancy in rural settings especially in
South India Hence the current study was done to
determine the prevalence and outcome of high risk
pregnancy and factors associated with it among antenatal
women attending rural primary health care center in
Puducherry South India
Materials and Methods
This is a record based longitudinal study conducted
by reviewing the maternal and child health MCH
register maintained in the antenatal clinic of JIPMER
Rural Health Centre JIRHC during March
Records were reviewed for the details of pregnant
women available over a period of years from
January to December JIRHC caters to a
population of around spread over four villages
namely Ramanathapuram Thondamanatham
Pillaiyarkuppam and Thuthipet All the four villages
are located within km of the health center which is
located in Ramanathapuram village Health services
are provided by senior resident from the department
of preventive and social medicine who is the medical
officer in charge of the health center undergraduate
intern trainees postgraduates posted from the
Department of Community Medicine JIPMER as well
as by nursing staff and public health nurses
The antenatal clinic of JIRHC is a special clinic established
exclusively for providing comprehensive health checkup
and referral services of pregnant women under the
supervision of the department of community medicine
It is functional once a week at health center which is
located in Ramanathapuram village On an average
pregnant women will be attending every antenatal
clinic and avail health care services The health care
services include essential antenatal care services such as
registration of pregnancy tetanus toxoid immunization
recording of body weight and blood pressure at each
follow up visit basic laboratory investigations such as
hemoglobin blood grouping glucose challenge test
venereal disease research laboratory HIV hepatitis B
surface antigen testing provision of iron and folic acid
tablets counseling for danger signs of pregnancy birth
preparedness nutrition and importance of spacing
contraception immunization and breastfeeding
obstetrician consultation and routine health and
antenatal checkup follow up and referral services
Patients who had missed the scheduled visit are being
followed by the health workers through mobile call or
home visit
All the above mentioned services are provided free of
cost The obstetrician consultation is provided by senior
resident of the department of obstetrics and gynecology
The counseling services are provided by staff nurse
interns posted at JIRHC and medical social worker The
prescription for medication laboratory investigations
to screen for complications and also referral forms for
further follow up in tertiary care center among high risk
cases are given The patient is advised to make regular
follow up visits
Each antenatal woman has a comprehensive case record
which is updated during every visit by the health
workers The case records are issued by medical record
department with a unique identity number This identity
number is entered in the attendees register maintained
at antenatal clinic Confidentiality of information for
all pregnant women was maintained under this unique
identity number The health workers update the blood
pressure during the visit recent blood investigation
reports and also regarding specific advice given to
pregnant women in that case record
Line list of pregnant women who were registered in
antenatal clinic maintained at JIRHC was obtained In
total there were around pregnant women registered
with antenatal clinic Out of which records of

Parity and socioeconomic status were found to be

Similar findings were found in study done in
Karnataka However we could not assess the other
factors influencing the high risk pregnancy such as
education age at marriage and age at first pregnancy
which were reported by other studies Outcome of the
pregnancy was also found to be unfavorable among the
high risk cases in the current study which is comparable
to the studies done in other parts of India
Limited evidence available on birth outcomes reported
significant association between low birth weight and
high risk pregnancy which is comparable to the current

lower segment cesarean section which is contrast to the
current study However the current study found that
preterm and postterm delivery is more common among
high risk pregnant women
Major strength of the study is the use of standard
guidelines for the diagnosis of high risk pregnancy
which will help to compare the current study findings
across various studies from India All the records were
included in the study which represents the reality of the
status of pregnant women in rural setting The current
study adds to the limited literature available regarding
outcome of high risk pregnancy in a primary care setting
However the study has its own limitations Since the
study is record based and we relied on the data recorded
in the case record there could be errors in entering
the data of the pregnant women by the stakeholders
We could not gather data on various possible factors
Majella et al Outcome of high risk pregnancy in India
influencing high risk pregnancy such as education
employment status spousal support age at marriage
and age at first pregnancy Causal outcome for factors
related to high risk pregnancy and outcomes cannot
be inferred as the data on time of exposure cannot be
retrieved from the case records Further cohort studies
can be done to focus on factors influencing the high risk
pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy
High risk pregnancy can have serious maternal
obstetric and neonatal complications if left undetected
The Government of India has introduced several schemes
for early detection of high risk pregnancy with recent
one being PMSMA which aims to provide quality
antenatal care for pregnant women throughout the
country Even though several measures are taken to
tackle the problems frequent monitoring by the relevant
stakeholders for success and quality of the schemes needs
to be done This can be done by surveying the reduction
in the trend of high risk pregnancy and increase in the
trend of favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes This
can help in improving the quality of service delivery and
strengthen the interventions already in place
Conclusion
The current study found that almost one fifth of the
pregnant women in rural area have high risk pregnancy
with majority of them contributed by maternal age and
PIH Parity and socioeconomic status were independently
associated with high risk pregnancy Even though
most of the study participants had favorable obstetric
and neonatal outcomes unfavorable outcomes such as
low birth weight preterm and postterm delivery were
more common among high risk antenatal women Hence
early detection of high risk pregnancy needs to be done
at primary health care level to improve the maternal
obstetric and neonatal outcome through quality and
accessible antenatal care and appropriate referral services

Analyzing the Effect of Prenatal Care
on Pregnancy Outcome
A Conditional Approach

ABSTRACT
Am Health
InfrMuction
Vital statistics data is a readily avail
able source of information on prenatal
care usage in the United States How to
examine vital statistics and other types of
data for the effect of prenatal care on preg
nan outcome has generated a number of
different methodologies One of the dif
ficulties encountered in using such data
has been the problem of overcoming the
preterm bias effect The preterm bias ef
fect is associated with observing better
outcomes in women who receive prenatal
care than in women who receive no care
This artifact occurs because women re
ceiving no care may deliver prematurely
and may not have an opportunity to enroll
in prenatal care By conditioning the ef
fect of the age of entry into prenatal care
on the gestational age of delivery how
ever the preterm bias effect can be
avoided Nonetheless other problems en
countered in vital statistics data may in
validate the results of the conditional ap
proach
In this study we demonstrate the ef
fect that the possible misclassification of
gestational age in vital statistics data has
on the interpretation of the conditional ap
proach and discuss the problematic nature
of the evaluation of prenatal care
The data for this analysis were ob
tained from linked birth and death certif
icates from Missouri for through
The variables used in the analysis
were the gestational age at which prenatal
care was initiated self report and limited
to the first weeks of pregnancy the
gestational age at delivery based on last
menstrual period the outcome stillbirth

Black or non Black birth number mul
tiple vs single parity maternal age and
maternal education We used only those
records that involved gestational ages of
greater than weeks and less than
weeks Of the records available
were used for the unad
justed analyses and were
used for the adjusted analyses
The association of the gestational age
of entry into prenatal care with pregnancy
outcome was examined relative to the ges
tational age of delivery Outcomes still
births or infant deaths are presented as
death rates percentage dead We calcu
lated odds ratios for stillbirths or infant
deaths by logistic regression models
adjusted for race Black vs non Black

ity and parity greater than compared
with parity through maternal age less

linear trends were carried out for mortality
rates over the gestational ages of entry
into prenatal care Furthermore we
adjusted our results by declaring new
borns that exceeded the percentile
birth weight standards for gestational age
reported by as misclassified
All computations were carried out using
Results
By conditional analysis the risk per
centage of mortality of stillbirth or infant
death for those women who delivered at

This higher risk of mortality in early

Discussion
As Tyson et al state the value of
prenatal care has been diffcult to estab
lish When the time of entry into pre
natal care is assessed relative to the time
of delivery several interpretations about
the association of prenatal care with preg
nancy outcome become available For ex
ample it appears that in women who de
livered at less than weeks and who
entered prenatal care in the first trimester
there were more adverse pregnancy out
comes than in those women who delivered
at this ne and were not in prenatal care
We believe this is an artifact Kramer et al
have reported a systematic underestima
tion of gestational age in infants born be
fore weeks when the gestational age is
based solely on the last menstrual period
When infants weighing over the per
centile for their gestational age were elim
inated from the analysis there were no
ignificant trends in mortality rates over
the gestational age of entry into prenatal
care except for those women delivering

between and weeks Whether pre
natal care for these women is responsible
for the better outcome of the early en
trants cannot be determined Early entry
may reflect as much on the healthy behav
ioral characteristics of these women as it
does on any effect of prenatal care
The evaluation of prenatal care is a
complex problem The incorrect assign
ment of gestational age affects signifi
cantly the results of any perinatal analysis
and continues to be a major problem for
which no solution is readily available As
a result there is no ideal model available
to assess the association between prenatal
care and pregnancy outcome Because of
the substantial problems associated with
observational data the use of randomized
trials of different modes of care deserves

The safety of Home Birth The Farm
Study
A Mark Durand MI MPH
Despite a sizable body of literature on
the subject the authors of two recent re
views have concluded that a final judg
ment regarding the relative safety of home
birth still cannot be made
This study compares the outcomes of
a cohort of planned lay midwife
attended home births from the Farm mid
wifery service in rural Tennessee with the
outcomes of a sample of physician at
tended hospital births derived from the
US National Natality Fetal
Mortality Survey NNS NFMS This is
the largest comparative study of a cohort
of home births yet published
Previous studies of home birth safety
underscore the importance of having ex
plicit comparison groups rather than of
being strictly of considering
planned and unplanned home births
separately of tracking intrapartum hos
pital transfers of intended home births
and attributing the outcome to the home
birth group and of controlling for the
effects of birth weight type of delivery
attendant and demogaphic characteris
tics of the mother All these issues have
been addressed in this study
Standards of prenatal care at the
Farm are modeled to the recommenda
tions of the Arnerican College of Obste
tricians and Gynecologists Deliveries are
conducted without analgesia however
and great emphasis is placed on meeting
the emotional needs of the family Several
family members and friends are com
monly in attendance and are encouraged
to take an active role in the birth In
addition the laboring woman is encour
aged to stay off her back and remain phys
ically mobile through labor and delivery
In the absence of signs of fetal distress
women are permitted to labor beyond
hours occasionally for to days They
are also encouraged to eat and drink dur
ing labor in the belief that this allays ma
ternal and the need for opera
tive delivery

Methods
Data
We studied Medicaid recipients in
New York State who delivered live born sin
gleton children between and who
were identified by a tested case finding
screen as HIV infected and who had claims
data linked to vital statistics records of
mothers For mothers with multiple deliver
ies in the study period one delivery was ran
domly selected The study population also
reflects the prior exclusion of mothers
who participated in programs that paid a
global fee for prenatal care since we could
not determine the number or type of their
visits
Birth outcomes served as the criteria for
our analyses Low birthweight was specified
as less than g and preterm birth was
defined as a gestational age of less than
weeks based on the physician s esti
mate or when the physician s estimate was
unavailable of cases the mother s esti
mate of her last menses
The APNCU index was calculated in

To control for possible confounders we

viral load and T lymphocyte data we
evaluated maternal HIV stage from diag
noses previously reported to be predictive of
maternal child HIV transmissio including
history of clinical DS pne monia or

diagnoses on claims Illicit drug use was
measured by an approach that in previous

marital status nativity US including Puerto

attainment and smoking and alcohol use
during pregnancy
Analysis
Simple K computed
to assess the chance corrected agreement
among the different measures of adequate
prenatal care These are interpreted in the
same way as intraclass correlation coeffi
cients To evaluate the relative strength of the
association between the variously specified
APNCU indexes and birth outcomes we
compared logistic regression models for
each outcome Each model included the
same covariates with I of the APNCU
indexes there were no significant interaction
terms and the adjusted odds ratio and
confidence interval were contrasted
Results
In of the deliveries the infants
were low birthweight a similar proportion
were preterm The proportion of mothers
with adequate prenatal care utilization var
ied from one half for the APNCU index
derived from vital statistics to two thirds for
the index based on visits to the most com
prehensive set of providers Table As
shown by the K statistic we observed poor
agreement between each of the claims
based APNCU indexes of prenatal care and
the birth certificate based APNCU index
Agreement among the claims based mea
sures was considerably better
The adjusted odds ratios for the types
of data source did not differ dramatically for
either birth outcome Table However the
APNCU measure based on visits to the most
comprehensive set of providers primary
care obstetrics gynecology and HIV special
ists consistently showed the strongest asso
ciation with a to reduction in the
adjusted odds of either birth outcome The

Discussion
The assessment of adequacy of prenatal
care utilization based on birth certificate data
showed little agreement with that based on
claims Previous studies of the concordance

shown simi lar poor agreem nt our
study measures we foun
t the most
comprehensive claims based APNCU index
had the strongest association with both low
birthweight and preterm birth
The APNCU measure developed by
Kotelchuck was not intended to take into
account care by providers other than those
directly involved
ell ering obstetric and
gynecologic ser es n considering visits
to other providers such as internists and HIV
specialists in a measure of adequacy of pre
natal care we may have classified some
women as having adequate prenatal care
when they actually had fewer obstetric visits
than recommended However we hypothe
size that visits to these other providers facili
tated detection and treatment of conditions
that could have had an adverse effect on birth
outcomes e g serious infections hyperten
sion severe anemia asthma or poor nutri
tion We cannot say whether a study of
healthy women or women with diseases other
than HIV infection would show a similar
advantage to considering care during preg
nancy delivered by providers other than
obstetricians
American Journal of Public Health
Our findings should prompt researchers
to consider the value of administrative data
in the examination of prenatal care adequacy
They should also lead researchers to recon
sider the Wpes of visits that should be included
in an evaluation of prenatal care utilization
or more accurately an evaluation of care
during pregnancy For women with chronic
diseases treatment from a broader set of
providers may contribute to improved birth
outcomes Z

Past studies of maternal home visitation
programs have feported attr tion rates rang
ing from to Although the primary
goal of most honie visitation studies is to
measure programmatic effects on infant mor
bidity and mortality investigators often face
difficulties estimating program benefits
when a substantial proportion of women drop
out earlier than expected
To date relatively few studies have
focused on examining the characteristics of
women who diol of prevention programs
prematurely of these studies have
focused on pregnant women at risk for poor
psychosocial functioning and none are spe
cific to maternal home visitation programs
Given the dearth of information concerning
the characteristics of program dropouts and
completers and the applicability of this
knowledge to program planning the present
study examined associations between
women s sociodemographic characteristics
perceived needs psychological functioning
substance use and informal social support
networks and their duration of participation

Abstract In order to build knowledge and to make informed
decisions regarding childbirth women need to gather information
Online resources can play a relevant role to its access and health
professionals can recommend support and endorse it The aim of
this study is to understand the current state of e health services for
childbirth education provided by the Portuguese I lealth System
The data was collected from five portals a Portuguese National
Patient Portal b Academia project website c Portuguese Health
System website d Digital Library in Health Literacy e
Results show that childbirth topics are scarce or inexistent on
those platforms Only one document was found related to
Pregnancy with four pages regarding Childbirth which were
analysed according to the topics coverage organisation approach
and visual presentation The results show that there is room for
novel initiatives on e health to promote childbirth education in

The emergence of Electronic Health can be associated with
the usage of informatics systems and services in healthcare not
only by health professionals but also by the general public E
Health outline can be established when information and
communication technology is used in order to be a valuable
resource to improve health care and on a broader sense when
users of digital devices access healthcare information as well as
useful services and tools that promote a healthy living by helping
them to manage their own health and wellness l
Pregnant women have been using digital technologies for
information and support with differentiated uses according
to successive digital technology eras They usually search for
information in pregnancy related to websites and blogs and
interacted through discussion forums More recently
with the advent of diverse new digital media as social web and
mobile ubiquitous computing devices they expanded even
more their usage According to Tripp et al by

the frequency of visits to the hospital since their anxiety levels
dropped and they could understand their own conditions

expectant parents to better distinguish which resources are
trustworthy containing reliable and up to date information and
which ones should be ignored since it is imperative to separate
facts from fiction by clarifying popular and problematic
discourses around pregnancy labour birth and the unbom
As reinforcement tools there are specific digital materials
that could be used to help clarifying definitions and to
demonstrate the process and explain interventions ranging from
e books digital illustrations photos and videos to sum up to the
conventional printed based approach of handling brochures and
booklets
A study from already highlighted the importance of
websites run by health professionals e g Mayo Clinic
governmental websites and medicine research sources e g
Pub Med The majority of participants in the survey suggested
that the healthcare providers should recommend suitable Internet
sites for the purpose of adding information to the one provided
during the appointments gaining more control over their
decisions related to pregnancy and raising their confidence for
talking to the health professionals about their concerns
This study aims to analyse the current state of e Health
services and digital information provided by the Portuguese
National Health System Sistema Nacional de SNS that
could be pointed out by health professionals to contribute for
childbirth knowledge in particular related to labour and birth
topics This study is part of an ongoing PhD research to deepen
knowledge on the role that digital media could have to support
the informed decision making process by providing
educational resources that clarify the best practices

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective Medication abortion MAB is safe and effective up to days gestation Limited data are
available on how often patients are ineligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age and how many of
those ineligible go on to receive procedural abortion
Study design Retrospective analysis of electronic health records from Planned Parenthood of the Pacific
Southwest PPPSW from January December PPPSW has four procedural abortion sites and MAB
only clinics that offered appointments only if last menstrual period based GA was days or unknown
Patients days gestation by intake ultrasound at a MAB only clinic were referred to a procedural center
Results Of patients presenting for MAB at MAB only sites did not receive a MAB
N presented past days gestation and were thus ineligible due to gestational age limits Of those
ineligible N measured between days of gestation Three quarters of those
ineligible went on to receive a procedural abortion at PPPSW after a mean wait time of days In multi
variable analysis no demographic factors were associated with higher odds of receiving a procedural
abortion
Conclusions Presenting for MAB past a gestational age limit was uncommon supporting safety of no test
MAB protocols A quarter of people ineligible for MAB due to gestational age did not receive a procedural
abortion at PPPSW If MAB were offered up to days half of patients who were denied MAB due to
gestational age could have received MAB expanding patient access
Implications Being ineligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age was uncommon Increasing MAB
gestational age limits from days to days could further improve abortion access

Access to abortion services is increasingly under threat Efforts to
improve access have included expansion of medication abortion
MAB services into new practice settings leading to increases in the
number of non hospital facilities that provide MAB II Not all clinics
that provide MAB have the necessary trained providers or facilities
to also offer procedural abortion As of of abortion clinic
facilities in the United States only provided MAB For instance in

MAB were beyond days gestation
However it is unknown
how frequently people present beyond days gestation at MAB
only clinics and whether these patients are able to follow through on
referrals to sites offering procedural services
Assessing outcomes for people who are ineligible for MAB based
on gestational age and must be referred provides important nuance
to our understanding of systemic barriers to abortion care It also
informs discussion of the optimal days gestation up to which med
ication abortion should be offered and the implications of omitting
dating ultrasounds prior to MAB which are particularly relevant
given the recent rise of both no test MAB protocols and self man
aged MAB In a unique cohort of patients who did not receive a MAB
after presenting for one at a MAB only Planned Parenthood filiate
clinic we sought to determine frequency of being ineligible for
medication abortion due to days gestation characterize
frequency and duration of delays in care among patients who did not
receive same day MAB and estimate the number of people who
could have received a MAB if gestational age limits were raised to
days
Materials and methods
Definition of sample
Patients included in the study did not receive a MAB after pre
senting for MAB at a PPPSW clinic that does not offer procedural
abortion services from January through December Fig
The PPPSW system has clinics of which offer only MAB one of
which offers only procedural abortion and three of which offer both
MAB and procedural abortion Patients scheduling a MAB appoint
ment either online or by telephone provide a date of LMP and are
able to schedule a MAB appointment only if their estimated days
gestation at the time of scheduling is under days If they have an
uncertain LMP they are directed to call for an appointment and are
allowed to schedule at a MAB only clinic but receive counseling that
they may need a procedural abortion if they are beyond days
gestation on intake ultrasound If a patient is ineligible for MAB after
intake ultrasound at a MAB only clinic they are referred to and
scheduled at a procedural location for a later date At the time of the
study MAB was only provided to patients presenting at days
gestation or less by ultrasound Affiate policy allowed for the pro
vision of MAB in patients with a pregnancy of unknown location on
ultrasound if the patient was asymptomatic no vaginal bleeding or
abdominal pain and had no other risk factors for ectopic pregnancy
The study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional
Review Board at University of California San Diego
Primary variables of interest
All patients received a clinic administered urine pregnancy test
and transvaginal ultrasound at their MAB appointment unless their
in clinic pregnancy test was negative Ultrasound findings were used
to determine type of pregnancy including Intrauterine pregnancy
ultrasound had a clear intrauterine yolk sac and or fetal pole
Pregnancy of Unknown Location PUL positive pregnancy test
without a definitive intrauterine pregnancy Possible Molar
Pregnancy and Early Pregnancy Loss EPL anembryonic preg
nancy complete abortion retained products of conception in
trauterine fetal demise or incomplete abortion Confirmed ectopic
pregnancies were not included in the sample Gestational age vari
ables included both patient reported last menstrual period as well
as ultrasound measurement of fetal pole or gestational sac Receipt
of a procedural abortion after initial MAB visit was determined by
review of medical records from PPPSW procedural centers In order
to account for incomplete follow up for those who had their initial
MAB visit at the end of the study period analysis of the receipt of

procedural abortion was restricted to patients who had their initial
MAB visit before September Thus this cohort was followed
until at least weeks gestation legal limit of abortion in
California
Demographic variables
Data on race and ethnicity were collapsed into larger categories
for ease of analysis Categories provided in the clinical records in
cluded white African American Black Asian and Hispanic Latinx In
addition an Other category was created which included patients
who identified their race as Filipino multi racial Middle Eastern
Native American Pacific Islander and other Patient age was re
ported in number of years and was analyzed as a continuous vari
able Patient state of residence was collapsed into two categories
In state for those residing in California and out of state for
those from all other states or outside of the United States Type of
payment for the medication abortion visit was reported as Medi Cal
California based Medicaid commercial insurance or self pay
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated comparing those who
presented for MAB prior to versus after days gestation by ultra
sound Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to de
termine which demographic factors were associated with odds of
receiving a procedural abortion among those who presented for a
MAB visit but were ineligible due to being beyond days gestation
by ultrasound Multivariable logistic regression was performed to
estimate adjusted odds ratios Covariates thought likely to influence
whether patients were able to follow up after being denied MAB
were included in the multivariable model age race ethnicity pay
ment type and ultrasound based days gestation at presentation
Alpha was set at for all regression models Analysis was per

Discussion
We explored eligibility for MAB based on gestational age and
found that of all patients presenting for MAB at a MAB only
clinic were past the clinic gestational age limit of days by ultra
sound despite clinic screening that offered appointments only to
patients days gestation by LMP Of patients who were not eli
gible to receive a MAB due to gestational age the majority went on
to receive a procedural abortion and most within two
weeks of their initial MAB appointment
Medication abortion is safe and effective up to days gestation
with some research supporting high effcacy even beyond
days
We found that of all patients presenting at MAB
only sites were between days gestational age Importantly
over half of patients in our study ineligible due to gestational age
limit would have been eligible if MAB were offered up to days
Given this offering MAB up to days could improve clinic oper
ating effciency and patient access to care However these benefits
are more likely to be realized if patients with estimated gestation
between days are not scheduled at MAB only clinics Of note
since this study was completed the study site implemented a prac
tice change to allow MAB provision up to days gestation Patients
with dating by LMP up to days are now able to schedule at MAB
only clinics
A notable proportion of the patients who were in
eligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age did not later re
ceive a procedural abortion at PPPSW Geographic financial
political and logistical barriers can prevent patients from acting on
referrals and accessing follow up care
For instance it is
possible some patients who traveled long distances to Southern
California for a MAB were unable to return at a later time for a
surgical abortion However it is unknown based on available data
what percentage of patients desired a procedural abortion but faced
barriers arranging follow up versus decided they no longer desired
pregnancy termination or sought pregnancy termination at a site
outside PPPSW Further research via patient interviews or surveys
would be useful in answering these questions and seeking solutions
to barriers that prevent patients from obtaining desired care
Increased focus and research on no test medication abortion
protocols that don t require an ultrasound was driven by the
Coronavirus COVID pandemic Our findings including the
overall low incidence of presentation beyond days and relatively
high accuracy of history based dating when compared to ultrasound
are in line with prior research that has shown no test protocols are
safe and effective without a preceding ultrasound to confirm dating
A prior study conducted at another Planned Parenthood filiate
found that medical management of PUL results in sooner diagnosis
of ectopic pregnancy than expectant management
Despite this
we found that a significant number of patients that did not receive a
planned MAB had a pregnancy of unknown location This population
likely contains patients who were symptomatic vaginal bleeding
abdominal pain and thus not eligible for MAB Our data did not
allow for stratification by symptoms and our study was not designed
to determine frequency of MAB provision for patients with PUL but
these findings suggest further research is needed to understand
current trends in the implementation of MAB for PUL
Strengths of our study include the large sample size and inclu
Sion of multiple different clinical sites that were unified under a

consistent clinical protocol However our findings should be con
sidered in light of several limitations We relied on health record
data which did not allow us to determine why patients did not go on
to receive a procedural abortion In addition the generalizability of
our results is limited as the study only included Planned Parenthood
filiate clinics in Southern California and was conducted during the
COVID pandemic Differing screening policies within other clinic
systems are likely to impact the frequency with which patients
present for MAB past gestational age limits
Overall our study demonstrated that within a large family
planning clinic system a significant portion of patients who pre
sented for MAB and did not receive one were ineligible based on a
gestational age limit for MAB care If the gestational age limit for
MAB had been increased to days during the study period the
majority of these patients would have been eligible for MAB at their
initial visit In a system with a robust referral structure most pa
tients ineligible for MAB by gestational age ended up receiving a
procedural abortion with a reasonable wait time but further re
search is needed to understand if this holds true in other areas and
health systems

ABSTRACT
Child malnutrition is a significant public health concern in several developing countries Evidence suggests
that family size and children s health outcomes are correlated We utilize data from the National Family
Health Survey NFHS for India and employ an Instrumental Variable approach to examine the impact
of limiting fertility through the use of contraceptives on child health Exploiting the exogenous variation in
district average of women s exposure to family planning messages we estimate that contraception leads to
a SD increase in a child s height for age weight for age z scores and reduces the likelihood of
stunting being underweight by pp We provide support to the resource dilution hypothesis as
our potential mechanism highlighting that an exogenous increase in household size explained by multiple or
twin births depletes children s health Our findings underscore the benefits of exposure to family planning for
child health and the need for targeted policies focusing on access to and use of contraceptives
Child malnutrition is a rising and persistent issue affecting most
of the low and middle income countries across the globe As of
the World Health Organization estimates suggest that mil
lion children under years of age are stunted million are wasted
and million are overweight Aside from having a long lasting phys
iological effect on children undernutrition has also been linked to poor
mental development lower academic performance and behavioral ab
normalities Martins et al Dercon and
Besides
undernutrition has significant economic consequences through loss of
human capital and productivity perpetuating poverty and abating the
development of nations
Shekhar et al and
World Food Pro
gramme Report observe that the economic cost of malnutrition
can range from of a country s GDP to as high as in the most
severely impacted countries For India in particular child malnutrition
has been a chronic problem India slipped in its ranks from to

in Mumbai which is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare MoHFW Government of India The sample is drawn using
stratified random sampling
We use the individual women s and children s data from NFHS
Individual women s data consists of one record for every eligible
woman in the reproductive age of and years and collects infor
mation about her background characteristics health knowledge health
behaviors fertility patterns child s health and nutritional status as well
as household characteristics We restrict the women s data to include
women married only once to ensure that the woman s responses about
contraceptive use pertain to her current union
The children s data consists of one record for every child of the in
terviewed woman born up to five years preceding the survey It collects
information on both demographic and anthropometric characteristics of
children between the ages of O to months We merge the two data
sets and our unit of analysis is the children born to women in the last
five years Our final sample consists of observations
Measurement of child nutritional status
NFHS contains information on the nutritional status of children
under the age of For our baseline analysis we measure child health
with their anthropometric measures of nutritional surveillance viz
height for age z score HAZ and weight for age z score WAZ These
anthropometric measures are calculated for children under by their
age and sex based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
CDC Standard Deviation derived Growth Reference Curves which are
derived from the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS CDC
Reference Population Le and Nguyen Child s anthropometric
measures reflect the nutrition and growth status of children in both the
long run and the short run Thomas et al WHO
These
anthropometric measures are described as the number of standard
deviations below or above the median of the international reference
population
Contraceptive use
The survey also provides information on a couple s contraceptive
use Specifically the respondents are asked have you ever used any
thing or tried to avoid or delay getting pregnant Here the contra
ceptive methods may include using a contraceptive pill injections
IUD condoms sterilization rhythmic periodic abstinence withdrawal
lactational amenorrhea foam jelly female condom and standard days
method We do not differentiate between the methods of contraception
and define our variable of interest as Everused such that it takes value
if the couple has ever used any of these contraceptive methods or
tried to delay pregnancy and O otherwise

bias and that the most straightforward approach to such concerns
is to include controls that can be observed we incorporate a va
riety of child woman and household controls chosen carefully and
comprehensively in our baseline estimations Our child level controls
include birth order whether the child is a twin multiple birth the
child s birth size age sex and whether the child has received polio
BCG DPT and measles vaccinations The mother s controls include
age education level and body mass index BMI to incorporate a
measure of her general health status whether she is covered by health
insurance intake of iron supplements during pregnancy and frequency
of antenatal visits during pregnancy Household level controls include
wealth index indicators of residence in a rural or urban area indicators
for religion Hindu Muslim Christian or other religions including Sikh
Jain Buddhist and others and caste Backward or other
Descriptive patterns analytical sample
Our analytical sample consists of observations
Table
presents the descriptive statistics of the variables used in our analysis
Mean HAZ is at standard deviations SD and mean WAZ is at
SD Our variable of interest Everused suggests that almost
percent of women have used some contraceptive method
In terms of child demographics roughly of the
sample consists of girls boys and the average age of a child is
approximately months Only about of the children are twins
or belonged to a multiple birth and approximately of children
are average or above in size at birth Approximately of children
have received the polio vaccination have the DPT vaccinations
and the BCG measles vaccinations
An average woman s age is approximately years have
completed primary education and approximately of women are
covered by health insurance On average around of women
received some iron supplements during pregnancy and had roughly
antenatal visits during pregnancy to the healthcare center
Demographics at the household level suggest that an average house
hold in our analytical sample belongs to the poor to middle income
category in terms of wealth index Roughly percent of the house
holds reside in rural areas approximately are backward castes
and the majority are Hindus
Empirical framework
Estimation strategy
We use the following empirical specification to investigate the effect
of a couple s contraceptive use on the HAZ and WAZ of children
where Yi refers to the outcome of interest HAZ or WAZ of child i
Everusedi denotes an indicator variable equal to if child i s parents
have ever used contraceptive measures and O otherwise Xi is the vector
of child specific controls Mi is the vector of child i s mother s char
is the vector of child i s household controls As denotes
acteristics
state fixed effects Our parameter of interest captures the effect of
the couple s use of contraception on their child s health outcomes All
standard errors are clustered at the survey cluster level
Oster also suggests that if a coefficient is stable after the inclusion
of the observed controls this can be taken as a sign that the omitted variable
bias is limited We also provide robustness of our baseline results with the
inclusion of additional controls in Section
Note that of women have used some contraceptive method in the
NFHS sample for the years We use the NFHS data in the
robustness Section
Our measure of wealth is based on the wealth index provided by DHS
which is a standardized measure of household economic status in a given
survey The households are divided into poorest poor middle richer and
richest households by the DHS

Notes The sample is restricted to women married only once The data provides information on all children
aged below years born to surveyed women Mother s BMI is a categorical variable ranging from O for
underweight to for obese The HH wealth index is a composite measure of a household s cumulative
living standard and ranges from poorest to richest Backward is a binary indicator of whether the
household belongs to the scheduled caste scheduled tribe or other backward classes or not
Identification strateu
To alleviate concerns of bias caused by omitted variables our
estimation technique incorporates a comprehensive set of controls
We additionally account for any systematic state level unobservables
that may affect contraceptive use by including state fixed effects But
because numerous unobservables could be linked with both Everusedi
and Yi the problem with the estimation of Eq
is that Everusedi
might be endogenous A causal interpretation of would demand that
there be no unobserved factors that are correlated with both Everusedi
and Yi conditional on our controls Concerns about endogeneity may
also arise if causality runs from the child s nutritional outcome to
Everusedi For instance the nutritional status of older children may
influence the couple s usage of contraceptives for subsequent pregnan
cies Additionally since Everusedi is self reported measurement error
in the variable could result in endogeneity The OLS estimate of
would be biased and inconsistent as a result of these issues In order
to determine the impact of the use of contraceptive measures on the
anthropometrics measures HAZ and WAZ we thus utilize an IV TSLS
technique
To construct our instrument we use data on family planning mes
sages from mass media sources like radio television and newspapers
First we define a binary variable that takes the value if the woman
has heard about family planning either on the radio or TV or newspaper
and O otherwise Each household in our sample receives a binary
We also utilize the OLS estimation technique to examine the effect of
contraceptive use on child health For brevity we do not include those results
in the paper The results are available upon request
indicator of media exposure as a result We then create a district average
of media exposure to generate our instrument We contend that the
couple s usage of contraceptives is inextricably linked to the average
exposure of women to family planning messages through mass media
This is consistent with a significant body of research that demonstrates
how information conveyed through mass media programmes can in
crease the use of family planning and alter reproductive behavior Jah
et al Agha and Van Rossem Gupta et al Olenick
exhibits the correlation between our IV and main variable
Fig
of interest Everusedi Note that there is a strong positive correlation
between them
Besides conditional on the controls the only channel through
which district average media exposure to family planning messages
would affect child i s nutritional status is through actual family plan
ning reproductive practices of the parents Thus we assert that our IV
is compelling in that it not only has a strong correlation with our key
variable of interest Everusedi but also does not have a direct effect
on HAZ and WAZ Further while including state fixed effects allays
We use a district level IV instead of a woman s own exposure to such
information as we believe that taking the district average makes the IV more
exogenous in nature than her own media exposure A woman s own media
exposure may be more highly correlated with several household level unob
servables such as intra marital bargaining access to household resources as
well as autonomy and relative position in the household These unobservables
plausibly have a direct impact on the health outcomes of children in that
household thus threatening the validity of household level IV Moreover own
media exposure is self reported and may suffer from measurement error As
such considering district averages reduces the measurement error making it
more appropriate as an IV and valid conditional on observables

being correlated to the IV given that our IV uses district level variation
we control for omitted variables at the district level in the robustness

with our basic set of controls the average exposure of women in a
district to family planning messages over mass media indeed affects
child health only through the actual family planning practices

Extensions
Modern methods of contraception
Here we extend our baseline analysis with the aim of specifically
examining the effect of using modern methods of contraceptives on the
HAZ and WAZ scores Typically to easily categorize family planning
methods modern contraceptive methods are defined as any product or
medical procedure that interferes with reproduction from acts of sexual
intercourse Hubacher and Trussell Following this definition
for our data this includes pills IUD injections diaphragms male
condoms female condoms female and male sterilization foam or jelly
and emergency contraception Traditional methods of contraception
consist of periodic abstinence withdrawal other traditional methods
lactational amenorrhea and standard days method First we study the
effect of modern contraception methods versus traditional methods or
not using contraceptives Second we examine the impact of modern
methods of contraceptives versus not using any contraception Third
we look at the effect of traditional methods of contraceptives versus no
contraception
presents the results Columns and provide the results
Table
for the regressions where our variable of interest is coded as if the
We also examine the effect of using modern versus traditional contracep
tives on child health for the subsample that reports using contraceptives We
find a positive and statistically significant impact of using modern methods
over traditional on a child s HAZ WAZ scores by SD However the
IV does not perform well on the specification tests and thus warrants caution
in interpreting these results as causal
Economic Modelling
couple has only ever used modern contraceptive methods and O if
they use traditional or no contraceptives The results are statistically
significant and we document an increase in the HAZ WAZ scores
by SD Columns and present the results where the
endogenous variable takes the value if the couples use only modern
contraceptives and O otherwise excluding those using traditional con
traceptive methods Again we note that the effects are largely robust
and similar HAZ WAZ increases by SD if the couples use
modern methods relative to not using any contraception method From
column and we find evidence that if couples use traditional
methods of contraception it leads to a rise in the HAZ WAZ score of
the child by SD Our IV fairs well in the specification tests
Other measures of nutritional deficiencies Stunting and underweight
Further we measure the effect of contraceptive use on other mea
sures of child nutritional status Specifically we focus on stunting
and underweight indicators Stunting based on a child s height and
age is considered a measure of chronic nutritional deficiency Under
weight on the other hand is based on a child s weight and age and
is considered a composite measure of both acute and chronic nutritional
Stunting typically results from long term
statuses
Croft et al
nutrition deprivation and leads to delayed mental development and
reduced intellectual capacity while being underweight significantly
increases the mortality risk
We consider both stunting and underweight as binary variables for
our analysis Stunted takes the value if the child is moderately or
severely stunted and O if the child is not stunted Our measure of
underweight similarly takes the value if the child is moderately or
acutely underweight and O otherwise More specifically
O not stunted
if H AZ
Stuntedi
I moderately acutely stunted if HAZ
Underweighti
O not underweight
if w AZ e
I moderately acutely underweight if WAZ
Given that our outcomes here stunted or underweight are binary in
nature as well as our variable of interest everused we utilize Roodman
s conditional mixed processes CMP framework as our IV esti
mation approach We present the results in
Columns
Table
present the marginal effects for Stunted and columns present
the same for Underweight without controls with controls and with fixed
effects added subsequently
Examining our most preferred specification including comprehen
Sive controls and fixed effects for Stuntedi in column we note that
if a couple uses contraception the probability that the child is stunted
decreases statistically significantly by percentage points pp As
we move to Underweighti we note a negative and statistically signifi
cant effect of contraceptive use on the probability of the child being
underweight see column the likelihood of being underweight
decreases by pp
In summary our results for the measures of chronic and acute nutri
tional deficiencies confirm our baseline results on HAZ and WAZ The
negative effects of a couple s contraceptive use on a child being stunted
or underweight corroborate the effects we find on the anthropometric
measures
Children whose weight for age z score WAZ is more than SD above the
mean as per WHO Child Growth standards are categorized as overweight for
age Since we are looking at nutritional deficiency we only consider whether
or not a child is underweight stunted as our main outcome variables We also
ran the analysis for the overweight category and found that contraceptive use
can lead to a slight increase in the likelihood of being overweight Results can
be made available upon request

Robustness
Falsification analysis
So far our findings indicate a positive and statistically significant
effect of a couple s use of contraception on their child s anthropometric
measures for nutrition surveillance Here we aim to demonstrate that
such a result cannot be reached using any randomly assigned HAZ and
WAZ outcomes To accomplish this we maintain the first stage link
between our endogenous regressor and our instrument while randomly
rearranging our outcome variables In other words we associate a ran
dom child j s HAZ and WAZ scores to the use of contraception by child
i s parents instrumented by the district average of women s exposure to
contraceptive methods through mass media Ceteris paribus this makes
the association between our dependent variables and the regressors in
our estimation random
We replicate this analysis times and show that of
the times there is no significant impact of the use of contraceptives on
the randomly assigned HAZ WAZ measure at level significance
To be precise we are unable to reject the null that the effect of
the use of contraceptives is equal to zero out of times
for HAZ WAZ Fig
plots the t statistics obtained corresponding to
the coefficients of contraceptive use on both HAZ and WAZ in each
of the replications This falsification test reveals that repeated
estimations with random assignments of contraception choice do not
produce significant results on children s anthropometric measures and
thus we are unable to falsify our baseline estimates
Household level sample
We estimate our preferred baseline specifications using data at the
individual child level where we consider multiple children per couple
and household A worry with this level of analysis is that given our data
limitations we only know if the couple has ever used any contraception
method We are unable to determine when the couple may have used
contraceptives or which pregnancy did it delay or affect In addition
since the number of children per couple can vary households with
more children repeat themselves in the data more than households with
one or fewer children in the analysis at the child level To address these
potential concerns and check the sensitivity of our baseline results
we also estimate our desired impacts using aggregated household level
data For every household we look at the average child characteristics
Instead of controlling for birth order and multiple births we now control
for the total number of sons and the total number of daughters in the
household

results are substantially robust The impacts are statistically significant
at the aggregated household level as well and the magnitudes are

Inclusion of additional district level controls
Our baseline regressions include child mother and household
level characteristics However it may be unrealistic to assume that
all district level characteristics affecting a couple s use of contracep
tives are uncorrelated with district level exposure to family planning
messages over mass media Thus we extend our set of controls to
include several district level average characteristics This addresses any
additional concerns regarding whether our IV satisfies the exclusion
restriction With this analysis we are also able to check if our baseline
results are robust to the inclusion of district controls Specifically
we include information on the number of health sub centers primary
health care centers community health care centers sub divisional hos
pitals and district hospitals at the district level as additional controls
We also utilize information on the district average of women s access to
both prenatal and antenatal care provided by ICDS workers Anganwadi
workers whether the respondent received any supplementary nutrition
from Anganwadi centers during pregnancy whether the child received
any benefits from Anganwadi in the last months whether the child
received food from Anganwadi centers in the last months how
often did the woman visit Anganwadi ICDS workers in the last
months the services and matters regarding pre school nutrition and
child healthcare discussed with the workers

of our analysis by also utilizing data from the NFHS survey wave

for child health We run our baseline regressions for HAZ and WAZ as

We find that in as well there are important and positive
effects of contraceptive use on child health In particular the results are
robust for HAZ for all specifications From our preferred specification
in column we note that HAZ increases by SD if the couple
uses contraceptives The effect is statistically significant We find a
similar trend for WAZ as well From column once we add the same
set of comprehensive controls in our regressions we find that the use
of contraception leads to a statistically significant rise of SD in
the child s WAZ The effect loses significance once state fixed effects
are included Overall contraceptive use persistently emerges as a key
predictor of children s nutritional outcomes as evidenced by the results
for the years our baseline but also for

contraceptives by the parents leads to a statistically significant decline
in the likelihood of the child being stunted More specifically the
probability of stunting declines by pp as seen from the marginal
effect reported in column Results are similar for the probability of
being underweight The marginal effects suggest a negative effect of
contraceptive use on the likelihood of being underweight Looking at
column with the comprehensive controls the reduction is of the
order of pp in the probability of being underweight as a result of
limiting fertility through contraceptives While we find that in both
and the effect loses statistical significance in Column

once state fixed effects are included we believe this is driven by some
degree of measurement error or imprecision in the data
By estimating the impact using an earlier round of data we pro
vide evidence that nutritional deficiency is a chronic problem for
the country that has yet to show much improvement This may be
a severe challenge for India in view of the COVID crisis which
has deteriorated an already critical situation India faces in terms of
malnourishment
Heterogeneity analysis

WAZ The following findings are noticeable from this heterogeneity
analysis
By sex of the child From both panels the estimates in columns
and show the effect of contraception use on the child s anthropo
metric measures We find a much larger statistically significant impact
on a girl s HAZ score compared to boys A couple s use of contraception
increases a girl s HAZ score by SD whereas a boy s HAZ score
increases by SD Also we find a statistically significant effect for
girls but not boys when we consider their WAZ scores Specifically we
note that the use of contraceptives increases a female child s WAZ by
SD
By caste We find a statistically significant effect of contraceptive
use on children s anthropometric measures for the backward caste
Contraceptive use increases the child s HAZ and WAZ by SD and
SD respectively No such effect is noted for the upper caste That
said a word of caution warranted here is that the sample size reduces
by a large extent for the upper caste sample
By area of residence Looking at the heterogeneous effects of con
traceptive use on children s health by rural or urban areas we find
statistically significant effects for rural areas for both HAZ and WAZ A
child s HAZ increases by SD and WAZ by SD in rural areas We
We provide additional heterogeneity analysis based on the mother s age
mother s education and child s birth order following a LASSO algorithm to
determine important covariates These results are presented in the Appendix
do not find a statistically significant effect of limiting fertility through
the use of contraceptives on the nutritional outcomes of children in
urban areas
By wealth We divide our sample into poor and rich households
and find statistically significant positive effects of contraceptive use on
children s HAZ for both poor as well as rich households Whereas when
considering WAZ as our outcome we only find an effect for the sub
sample of poor households Looking at the estimates for HAZ in column
the effect is larger for the poor households and is of the order of
SD for HAZ for the poor households and SD for the wealthy
households The effect of limiting fertility through contraceptives in
poor households shows a SD rise in WAZ of children
Heterogeneous effects of using modern contraceptive methods
We extend the heterogeneity analysis and examine the effect of
explicitly using only modern contraceptive methods on the HAZ and
WAZ for the same sub samples The pattern of results is similar and
robust for the sub samples of poor households rural households and
households belonging to the backward caste as in
Table Table
presents the results The impacts of using modern contraceptives are
stronger and statistically significant in columns and
which speak to the importance of access and awareness of contracep
tion for these sub samples A large proportion of our sample belongs
to rural India and almost of the households are either classified
as belonging to the poor or the poorest category of the wealth index

Considering this it is likely that the poor the backward castes and rural
households are more supply constrained in terms of access and ease of
using modern methods of contraceptives which is possibly driving the
more important effects we find in the heterogeneity analysis
Potential mechanism quantity quality trade off
Here we attempt to study a potential mechanism explaining the
positive effects of contraceptive use on child health that aligns with
the Becker and Lewis Becker and Tomes model of the
quantity quality trade off of children Extant literature documents that
increased parental time with children has significant implications on
early childhood development as well as future human capital accumu
lation
Gahramanov et al Milkie et al Parent s choice
to use contraceptive measures to limit the number of children born
may therefore have important implications on resource allocation per
child the quality of children s outcomes and thus their nutritional
status Relatedly there is substantial evidence recording negative as
sociations between the use of contraception and family size Cleland
and Harris Dills and Grecu Alam and
Abiona Kearney and Levine Ananat and
Hungerman To explore whether the effect of contraception
use on child health is dependent on the family size we conduct the

added individual mother s and average child s characteristics district controls household controls and finally
state fixed effects Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the cluster level

following analysis where we interact our main variable of interest
Everused with household size Specifically we estimate the following
econometric specification
Yi DIEverusedi H Hsizei Everusedi H Hsizei
where Yi refers to the outcome of interest HAZ or WAZ of child i
Mi and are the vectors of child mother and household specific con
trols As denotes state fixed effects Our parameter of interest here
captures the effect of the couple s use of contraception on their child s
health outcomes as household size changes
Table
presents the re
sults for our outcomes HAZ and WAZ scores We find that as household
size increases the impact of contraception use on a child s HAZ and
WAZ scores decreases by SD and SD respectively These
effects are statistically significant Thus we note evidence of a negative
differential effect of the interaction between contraception use and
family size In other words as household size increases the beneficial
impacts of improved family planning on child health get smaller
In order to assess if a change in household size is truly the mecha
nism explaining the positive effects of contraception on child health
we further examine the channel running from quantity to quality
in our sample We first estimate the effect of contraception use on
household size as illustrated in Panel a of Table where we find
that a couple s use of contraception leads to a statistically significant
decline in household size Following this we generate the predicted
household size in line with the methodology followed by Bose et al
which we then use to explain a change in a child s HAZ WAZ
scores The results for this are reported in Panel b of
Table
Acknowledging that household size is likely endogenous we examine
its effect on child nutrition using our IV approach Based on Li et al
Rosenzweig and Zhang Kugler and Kumar Lee
Zhang we consider the birth of twins multiple births
as the instrument for an exogenous increase in the number of children
in the household That being said it is entirely possible that twin or
multiple births may also not be exogenous in that healthier women are
more likely to give births to twins or have multiple births as evidenced
Bhaiotra and Clarke
As such we restrict the sample to
children whose mothers never miscarried nor had stillbirths to address
the potential endogeneity of twins or multiple births as the IV Utilizing

M Mookerjee et al
and Wiswall s findings that family size indeed affects child
health our estimates in

provide support to substantiate the
quantity quality trade off and resource dilution hypothesis as a plau
Sible mechanism driving our main results Thus we show that an
exogenous increase in the number of children is detrimental to their
nutritional status making the case for family planning stronger in af

hypothesis for the case of India
Conclusion
Child malnutrition is currently one of the most critical public health
issues in India with an alarmingly high proportion of children wasted
stunted and or underweight Media reports and researchers suggest
that India is slipping into a vicious cycle of malnourishment Despite
several efforts by the government under the umbrella of the National
Food Security Act which aims to target and significantly reduce child
malnutrition through Integrated Child Development Services ICDS
and Mid Day Meal Scheme MDMS India continues to grapple with
poor child health In light of this we assert that it is important to
understand other causes and channels that affect child health In this
paper we examine one such determinant of children s nutritional sta
tus Specifically utilizing the latest round of the NFHS we study the
causal effects of parents family planning practices that is their use
of contraception on children s anthropometric measures of nutritional
surveillance
By exploring the exogenous variation in the district average expo
sure of women to family planning messages through mass media we
find a positive impact of a couple s choice to use contraception on
children s nutritional statuses Having controlled for a comprehensive
set of controls as well as state fixed effects we provide robust evidence
that contraceptive use leads to a SD increase in a child s HAZ and
a SD increase in her WAZ In order to provide more context to our
results we compare and benchmark our estimates against other recent
work examining various factors impacting child health indicators We
find that our effects are in line with some of these findings For
example
shows that compulsory primary education
of mothers in Turkey results in an increase of HAZ WAZ by
SD respectively and
Chen
finds that having more than
children in violation of Vietnam s two child policy reduces HAZ WAZ
in year old children by SD respectively
Further we document interesting heterogeneous effects in that we
find larger effects on a female child s HAZ and WAZ for poor families
and those residing in rural areas for both HAZ and WAZ Beyond this
we also note some noteworthy effects of contraceptive use on the mea
sures of children s stunting and underweight indicators Specifically
the probability of being moderately or acutely stunted underweight
reduces by pp pp as a result of the parent s reproductive
practices Our results hold across individual child level data as well
as for the analysis conducted at the household level The results are
also robust to the inclusion of additional district level characteristics
Moreover we document that a couple s reproductive practices have a
causal effect on child nutrition using data from the previous survey
For a given family size lengthening birth intervals may be another poten
tial channel for positive effects on child health Exploring this channel further
while there is evidence that a couple s use of contraception is positively related
with length of preceding birth intervals we do not find any evidence of birth
spacing affecting children s anthropometric measures As such we are inclined
to rule out this channel as a potential mechanism in our case
As robustness we also utilize the district average of women s exposure
to family planning messages through mass media as an IV for household size
given that contraception use limits household size is widely established in the
literature and as such highly correlated with each other The negative effect of
an increase in household size on a child s HAZ and WAZ score remains robust
to this change in IV The results are provided in Appendix of the paper
Economic Modelling
wave of NFHS This result ought to be important for development
practitioners and policymakers given that the use of contraceptives by
the parents consistently appears vital in determining children s health
outcomes
We also examine a potential channel through which we could be
capturing the effect of contraceptive use on a child s nutritional indica
tors We provide evidence in support of the quantity quality trade off
indicating that with family planning measures and consequently fewer
children parents are more effectively able to invest resources towards
existing children We note that a truly exogenous increase in household
size does in fact lead to a decline in the nutritional indicators of
children for our sample
Nevertheless our findings must be read with a few caveats First
while our paper finds robust evidence that contraception leads to a
positive effect on child health our main variable of interest is an indi
cator of whether the couple has ever used contraception Information
on when the couple has used contraception or which pregnancy the
use of contraceptives has tried to affect delay may have led to a richer
analysis However it is impossible to identify this record from the
NFHS data To address this to some extent we provide an aggregate
household level analysis Second lengthening of birth intervals for a
given family size could be another potential channel of our effects
Longer birth intervals are known to improve child health outcomes
as evidenced in the literature
Molitoris Miller et al
Conde Agudelo et al Yeakey et al We find evidence
that contraception is highly correlated with a couple s choice of spacing
births and as such attempt to explore this channel in the paper Using
the information available in NFHS data we see a positive effect of using
contraception on the length of preceding birth intervals but the effect
of birth spacing on the anthropometric measures of child health is not
statistically significant perhaps on account of noisy data for preceding
and succeeding birth spacing As such we do not find enough evidence
to establish this as a plausible channel Third given the structure of the
NFHS data the respondent for the child level and individual questions
is the mother woman of the household We believe that children s nu
tritional status would also be impacted by their father s characteristics
However only a smaller sample of men were interviewed for a short
couple s survey in the data and including those variables results in the
loss of a large amount of critical information at the woman and child
level Hence in our analysis following the extant literature we utilize
mother child and household characteristics although incorporating the
father s characteristics would make the analysis more refined
Considering that better nutritional outcomes for children eventually
leads to better human capital accumulation improved productivity
and reduced healthcare costs we underline the importance of family
planning measures in tackling child ill health We assert that this has
important implications from a policy viewpoint While better sanita
tion food security and maternal healthcare have been examined as
important determinants of child health in the literature our paper calls
for greater focus on family planning measures specifically through
the encouragement of contraceptive use for improved child nutritional
status in a country riddled with both high populations as well as the
triple burden of child malnutrition Our findings also indicate that if
anything these family planning measures have greater positive effects
on children from backward castes poorer households and those resid
ing in rural areas Therefore it may be important to channel greater
efforts towards these groups to reap sizeable benefits for children s
health outcomes

combination of two adverse developmental
exposures or second hits has been widely
investigated previously e g combination
of poor diet and physical inactivity how
the effects of natural disasters and global
health crises combine to impact maternal
child health remains unclear
Pregnancy is a critical window in human
development as the fetus is particularly
vulnerable to external exposures result
ing in lifelong adverse consequences for
the offspring s health In this context
wildfires extreme heat and smoke expo
sure have been identified as an environ
mental exposure that is associated with
detrimental pregnancy and child health
outcomes Prenatal exposure to wildfires
has been linked to abnormal birth weight
and heightened rates of prematurity
gestational diabetes and hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy Similarly the
COVID pandemic has been shown
to increase maternal mortality ruptured
ectopic pregnancies stillbirth and ma
ternal depression Furthermore we
increasingly recognize that COVID is
disproportionately impacting women
and babies worldwide not only due to
infections with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV
but also from disruptions to maternal
and child health services It may
therefore be expected that women who
were pregnant during wildfires and gave
birth during the pandemic would experi

Potential mechanisms underlying

child metabolic health
In this section we elaborate on the knowl
edge gaps on mechanisms by which wild
fires and the COVID pandemic may
have synergistic detrimental effects on
maternal child metabolic health We pro
pose that the synergism is a consequence
of overlapping and interconnected mech
anisms mediated by indirect effects on life

mon to the two crises Figure These in
direct effects then amplify the overall
response by compounding the previously
reported direct toxic effects of wildfire

SARS CoV infection on the pregnant

including immune system
changes oxidative stress and abnormal
placental morphology and function
The placenta may have an important role
in protecting the fetus in such circum

of vertical SARS CoV transmission
However its capacity to protect may be
reduced with cumulative insults as is
more likely in syndemics

Box Timing is key
The temporal order of crises and triggered mechanisms is critical
Trends in Endocrinology Metabolism
In syndemic research it is essential to consider he order in which crises A B and resulting mechanisms
occurred as crisis A could exacerbate or reduce he impact of crisis B on maternal child health outcomes
For example natural disas ers increase psychological distress which could dampen maternal
immune response during COVID ernatively COVID increased communi y solidarity and
resilience which could facilitate community engagement and decrease individual distress during a
wildfire evacuation
During pregnancy and development the concept of critical window is well es ablished When a particular
disaster crisis perturbs these cri cal windows it determines the impact of that event on maternal and child
health For example crisis occurrence in pregnancy could affect fetal organ development while postnatally
it could affec breastfeed ng
Hence the temporal order should be given pivotal consideration to appropriately assess the
consequences of syndemcs on maternal child health

Advanced maternal age and risk perception A
qualitative study
Hamideh Bayrampour Maureen Heaman Karen A Duncan and Suzanne Tough
Abstract
Background Advanced maternal age AMA is associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes hence these
pregnancies are considered to be high risk A review of the empirical literature suggests that it is not clear how
women of AMA evaluate their pregnancy risk This study aimed to address this gap by exploring the risk perception
of pregnant women of AMA
Methods A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to obtain a rich and detailed source of explanatory data
regarding perceived pregnancy risk of women of AMA The sample was recruited from a variety of settings in
Winnipeg Canada In depth interviews were conducted with nulliparous women aged years or older in their
third trimester and with singleton pregnancies Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and content
analysis was used to identify themes and categories
Results Four main themes emerged definition of pregnancy risk factors influencing risk perception risk alleviation
strategies and risk communication with health professionals
Conclusions Several factors may influence women s perception of pregnancy risk including medical risk
psychological elements characteristics of the risk stage of pregnancy and health care provider s opinion
Understanding these influential factors may help health professionals who care for pregnant women of AMA to
gain insight into their perspectives on pregnancy risk and improve the effectiveness of risk communication
strategies with this group
Keywords Advanced maternal age Risk perception Qualitative study
Background
In the past three decades an increasing proportion of
women have delayed childbearing for educational social
and economic reasons Pregnancy at advanced ma
ternal age AMA defined as age years or older is
associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes in
cluding preterm birth low birth weight still birth
chromosomal defects labor complications and cesarean
section therefore it is considered to be a high
risk pregnancy However little is known about how
women of AMA perceive their pregnancy risk Under
standing perception of pregnancy risk is important be
cause it can affect women s health care use motivations

to seek care pregnancy and labor decisions adherence
to medical recommendations and health behavior
Risk perception is also incorporated as a key con
cept in constructing several theories of health behavior
such as the Health Belief Model Protection Motiv
ation Theory and Prospect Theory
The concept of risk at AMA may be composed of two
components the physiological challenges because of an
aging reproductive system and the social discourse of
risk and timing of childbearing Most previous work
on risk perception at AMA has focused on increased
risk of genetic abnormalities and the general concept of
pregnancy risk perception has received less consider
ation Current knowledge of risk perception at AMA is
based on a few studies that most of them primarily fo
cused on pregnancy experiences in which risk percep
tion was discussed as part of the pregnancy and birth
experience For instance Windridge and Berryman

in a study of British women s experiences of
giving birth at AMA explored risk perception and
reported that women of AMA may perceive a higher risk
for their babies during labor because of their older age
Another notable study on this topic is an Austra
lian qualitative study of prim gravid women of AMA
that was initially conducted to understand the experi
ences of women of AMA Later in Carolan
and Nelson conducted a secondary analysis of the quali
tative data and identified four themes central to percep
tion of pregnancy risk including realizing I was at risk
hoping for reassurance dealing with uncertainty and
getting through it negotiating risk p They
reported high levels of concern and anxiety among parti
cipants in spite of these women having healthy pregnan
cies and concluded that the notion of risk may have
negative impacts on these women A qualitative study by
Saxell primarily focused on studying the under
standings and beliefs about the risks associated with the
pregnancies of ten women of AMA Saxell reported that
these women found being labeled as high risk very chal
lenging hence several participants rejected this labeling
as part of their coping mechanism This study had a
number of limitations such as retrospective data collec
tion months after delivery and its unique population
participants who chose midwifery care which should
be considered in the interpretation of the results
The focus of previous studies has been on describing
the impact of being labeled as high risk on pregnant
women rather than exploring and elaborating on the
process of risk appraisal by these women Understanding
women s perception of pregnancy risk is essential in devel
oping more effective risk communication approaches
Considering the lack of literature in this area and limita
tions associated with previous studies we conducted a
mixed methods research study to further existing know
ledge on risk perception and its contributing factors
Mixed methods research is research in which the inves
tigator collects and analyzes data integrates the findings
and draws inferences using both qualitative and quantita
tive approaches or methods in a single study or a pro
gram of inquiry p Mixed methods research gives
the researcher an ability to use both numbers and words
and combine inductive and deductive thinking to address
the research problem Our study was composed of
both qualitative and quantitative components and using
a mixed methods approach we compared or integrated
the factors contributing to perception of pregnancy risk
determined by multiple regression analyses with the
women s perspectives obtained from qualitative inter
views to enhance current knowledge on this topic The
sample for the mixed methods study consisted of
participants women aged years and
women aged years or older In the quantitative
Page of
component we compared perception of pregnancy risk
in nulliparous women aged years or older n
with that of nulliparous women aged years
n In the quantitative component we also
developed a conceptual framework to explore factors
contributing to risk perception among nulliparous
women N The study reported here is the
qualitative component of this mixed methods study The
objectives of this qualitative study were to explore how
nulliparous women of AMA evaluate and define their
pregnancy risk and to arrive at a detailed understanding
of their risk perception The following research questions
were explored How do nulliparous women of AMA
define pregnancy risk Why do women of AMA feel
that their pregnancy is or is not at risk Which factors
influence perception of pregnancy risk What impact
if any did being labeled high risk have on these women s
lives and behaviors What are the experiences of
women of AMA with risk communication from health
care providers during pregnancy How do women feel
their perceptions of risk differ from those of their health
care providers if at all
Methods
A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to obtain
a rich and detailed source of explanatory data regarding
risk perception from women of AMA As described by
Sandelowski a qualitative descriptive study pro
vides a comprehensive summary of an event in the
everyday terms of those events p The qualita
tive descriptive method is a distinctive and valuable
technique and offers a direct description of phenomena
which is still interpretive As Sandelowski
stated this kind of research can address both descriptive
and interpretive validity to account for participants
observations and their understandings of these events
Participants were chosen purposefully from among the
participants in the quantitative component of the mixed
methods study Criteria for participation in the larger
mixed methods study were women with a singleton
pregnancy ability to speak read and write English and
gestational age of weeks or greater Any known se
vere psychological disorder was an exclusion criterion
Data were collected over months from December
to January from selected physicians offices
and outpatient prenatal care clinics at two tertiary hospi
tals in Winnipeg Manitoba
In purposeful sampling participants are intentionally
selected according to the needs of the study The
researcher asked selected women aged years or older
who had participated in the quantitative component of
the study if they were willing to participate in the quali
tative component Participants were selected to ensure
diversity in demographic and obstetric characteristics

most notably gestational age and pregnancy complica
tions In addition participants were recruited to reflect a
range of scores using the Perception of Pregnancy Risk
Questionnaire used in the quantitative component
to ensure inclusion of participants with different levels
of perception of pregnancy risk
Potential participants were provided with a written
and verbal explanation of the study Each participant
signed a consent form A mutually convenient time and
place were arranged to conduct the interviews In depth
semi structured face to face interviews using an inter
view guide were conducted by the researcher from Janu
ary to January The interview guide was
developed by the investigators and key areas explored
included decision making about timing of childbearing
women s understandings about pregnancy after age
perceived pregnancy risk and its impact on woman s
feelings and thoughts partner s perspectives about preg
nancy and women s experiences with the health care
system All interviews were audio recorded and tran
scribed verbatim In qualitative inquiry sample size re
lies on the concept of saturation which is the point at
which no new information or themes are observed in
the data Saturation was reached after interviewing
participants
Data analysis was carried out concurrently with data
collection Transcripts were analyzed using a content
analysis technique Content analysis is a systematic
and replicable method used for condensing many words
of text into fewer content categories based on explicit
rules of coding As mentioned earlier this study was
part of a mixed methods research study in which several
instruments were administered to women participating
in the quantitative component In this report selected
quantitative measures including the Perception of Preg
nancy Risk Questionnaire PPRQ perceived in
ternal control and pregnancy related anxiety
scores have been reported to enrich information about
participants and enhance the interpretations of the find
ings The scores on these scales were divided into tertiles
representing low middle and high scores based on the
responses of the women aged years or older in the

According to Davies and Dodd rigor refers to
the reliability and validity of qualitative research how
ever it does not necessitate the sense of replicability of
the research in different situations that is common in
quantitative research In the current study a valid
ation process was performed during and after conduct
ing the interviews using two strategies In the first
method member checking was used in which during
each interview the researcher HB verified the accuracy
of her interpretations with participants by asking further
questions After completion of data analysis interpreta
tions of data were shared by twelve participants who had
previously agreed to review and verify findings of the
study Second the results were confirmed with peer re
view and debriefing through regular meetings with one
of the co investigators MH to achieve a jointly devel
oped interpretation of the data Dependability was
obtained through use of an audit trail In this strategy
contextual information and participant s reflections were
documented The ways to address confirmability in this
study were using direct quotes and confirming the find
ings with participants during interviews

their childbearing for a variety of reasons The primary
reason for some women was lifestyle choices n
This group of women described being focused on their
career education or travel or indicated that they did
not feel that they were ready to have children until they
reached an older age Delayed marriage was the primary
reason for six other participants Finally three women
identified infertility issues as their primary reason for
postponed childbearing It should be noted that infertil
ity was also reported among participants in the delayed
marriage and lifestyle choices groups however it was
not their prime reason for delayed childbearing
The findings of this study were categorized into the
following themes definition of pregnancy risk factors
influencing risk perception risk alleviation strategies
and risk communication with health professionals
Definition of pregnancy risk
The first theme describes participants understandings
of pregnancy risk and explains how they defined risk
Most participants acknowledged that pregnancy risk
increases as maternal age rises however a number of
women felt that the risk had been overestimated For
example one of the participants stated that those
numbers don t matter Participant and another
mentioned that it s an overreaction frankly Partici
pant Women s understandings of risks associated
with AMA were reflected most often in comments
about their awareness of increased risk of infertility
issues and genetic abnormalities particularly Down
syndrome Fertility problems associated with delayed
childbearing were an immense concern for most
women rather than pregnancy related issues In this
regard most of the women who delayed marriage
reported that they decided to become pregnant soon
after marriage to minimize the effect of age factor on
their fecundity
It was noted that women considered pregnancy as
more of a societal issue rather than merely a biomedical
matter in which personal interpersonal and societal ele
ments were significant For our participants the mean
ing of risk was broader than medical issues and included
the extent of their support network their ability to con
trol situations and whether they had a secure relation
ship a planned pregnancy a flexible job or healthy
lifestyle and behavior These considerations were also
evident in decisions regarding timing of pregnancy by
participants The following quote is an example of the
broadness of risk definition by one participant with an
uncomplicated pregnancy
A high risk pregnancy to me would have been if I
had no control over my work environment
so
even just the ability to be able to work from home
if I was working in more a violent situation if I
was in a bad relationship I think that would make
me more of a high risk pregnancy than my personal
age or my personal health Participant
In the following quote a year old participant stated
on the importance of having a stable relationship and a
healthy lifestyle
I think you you have to factor in your physical
condition
that you re in good health and
you re taking care of yourself and you re planning
on getting married and you go and get your
physicals
I see a lot of younger girls that are
pregnant and they re drinking bottles of coke and
they re drinking coffee and they re drinking you
know they re eating McDonald s and I m like that
hasn t been my pregnancy you know I ve cut out
sugar and I ve never drank coffee so I don t worry
about that Participant
A year old participant with gestational diabetes and
a moderate perceived risk score commented
I had this this calm calm feeling inside of me that
everything was going to be okay
having a husband
that is loving caring supportive and you know is
my best friend so that really really helps a lot and
having friends you know friends to support to to
help you to talk with you if you have any need and
we have so many people caring about us so um
having a whole community to to be there for you if
you need Participant
Factors influencing risk perception
The magnitude of the perception of pregnancy risk dif
fered among our participants During data analysis nine
factors were identified that influenced women s perception
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
of pregnancy risk including cognitive heuristics of avail
ability and similarity of the risk predictability of the risk
health status pregnancy complications gestational age
perceived control poor fertility history anxiety and the
health care provider s opinion
Cognitive heuristics
Women s understandings of risk were mostly based on
their experiences of real cases and they relied on these
data in assessment of their own pregnancy risk
From my experience in Europe where most women
are having their children in their thirties and not their
twenties and to be honest I didn t and I lived there
for a long time I didn t see the amount of Down s
syndrome or other physical abnormalities that you see
here Participant
Most participants had an example of pregnancy at
AMA among one of their family members friends or
colleagues Availability of a positive example or a favor
able family history of fertility at AMA was often
reported as a reassuring factor that increased women s
perceived ability to conceive at AMA and to have a suc
cessful pregnancy These participants often perceived
their pregnancy as being low risk
I know a lot of women that are having their first
child in their forties
and everything has worked
out fantastic so I always looked at them as sort of my
mentors or role models Participant
Both like my mother had me when she was I
think and my partner s mother had her last one when
she was so it s it doesn t seem that abnormal in
my family And I think maybe that made me
feel less risky as well cause I had you know
generations before me that had late babies and with
no complications Participant
On the other hand women who were familiar with the
risks associated with older maternal age through per
sonal or vicarious experiences expressed more concerns
and perceived a higher risk for their pregnancies One of
the participants with a fairly healthy pregnancy and a
high perception of pregnancy risk score commented
A friend of mine got pregnant I think she was
and she did have a baby who had so many problems
that they were surprised the baby s heart was even still
beating in her womb so she ended up terminating
that pregnancy and she s still broken up about
so
I was debating this So yeah I did have that one
friend and of course the woman who told me about
her near death experience in labor Participant
Page of
Availability of risk is a cognitive heuristic that refers
to a cognitive shortcut used for judging the probability
of an event by the ease with which examples of the event
come to mind p Based on participants expla
nations this concept appeared to be very important in
risk appraisal One participant with a high perception of
pregnancy risk score explained if it risk happens to
other people then it could happen to me
Similarity is another cognitive heuristic and reflects
a cognitive shortcut used for judging the probability of
an event by its similarity to events with comparable fea
tures p Women often assessed their preg
nancy risk by comparing their own characteristics with
those who developed a pregnancy complication The fol
lowing comment from a year old participant is an ex
ample of using the similarity heuristic in risk appraisal
I had that friend who was and had a baby who
had Trisomy and she felt that it was because of
her age
but she is not as healthy as I am She
actually may have an alcohol problem and she s taken
a lot of medications in her life for depression and all
kinds of things and she doesn t really work out very
much and she just wasn t as healthy as I
am Participant
Predictability of the risk
An expected and predictable pregnancy complication
was perceived as a lower risk situation than a non
predicted and unexpected problem One participant with
a low perceived risk score who had severe morning sick
ness in early pregnancy described it as a typical preg
nancy symptom that could happen in every pregnancy
On the other hand another participant with a high per
ception of risk score and a low perceived control score
who had to stop working for an unexpected threatened
premature labor stated
It s been challenging so it s not what I expected
did not expect to feel an almost arthritic pain the last
two months I didn t expect that morning sickness
would be hours a day for five months instead of
three neither of us were expecting this I was
expecting to work until my due date and come to the
hospital and you know I was ready to be like every
other mom well most other moms where you work
till the end and sometimes you just go from work
straight to the hospital in labor Participant
A year old participant with a high perception of
risk score who was diagnosed with gestational diabetes
explained that
Both of my parents have adult onset diabetes and my
mother had gestational diabetes with my brother
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
when she was roughly the same age as me and so I
pretty much expected to have gestational diabetes so
I was careful right from the beginning making sure
that I was exercising and trying to eat healthfully and
so I was cautious about that
however I
so on
was surprised to find that I had needed the insulin for
it as opposed to control by diet that was a bit of a
shock It was a shock to discover that it was that
severe to begin with and that I would need the
insulin Participant
Health status
Most women in our study considered themselves
healthy and felt that they had control over their physical
health Good health was frequently identified as a factor
that would decrease risk when participants assessed
their pregnancy risk in relation to age They often
emphasized their good health as a balancing capacity in
pregnancy risk estimation A year old participant at
weeks of gestation with a low perception of risk
score commented
Because I was I m always I ve always been a quite a
healthy person it it never really concerned me that
much that I was older and having a baby Participant
Pregnancy complications
Among our participants three women had gestational
diabetes one had vaginal bleeding before weeks and
one had both vaginal bleeding before weeks and
threatened preterm labor Based on our findings preg
nancy complications had some influence on the percep
tion of pregnancy risk depending on the type of
complication its impact on the woman s life and the de
gree to which the woman felt that complication had
been controlled For instance the woman with threa
tened preterm labor who had to quit work expressed a
high risk perception On the other hand the other three
women who described their gestational diabetes as a
well controlled situation had low to moderate percep
tion of risk scores The following statement was made by
one of the participants who had a moderate perceived
risk score
I ve developed gestational diabetes in the end but
that s probably due to the fact that I already had
polycystic ovary syndrome so there was already
insulin resistance there was nausea initially but no
vomiting um a lot of weight gain but again that s the
insulin resistance so it s been an easy pregnancy I
suppose Participant
Women with pregnancy complications often had
higher pregnancy related anxiety scores One of the
Page of
participants with gestational diabetes expressed concerns
regarding having a larger baby than average and also
long term consequences of diabetes
The first week after diagnosis I was very very sad I
was very sad because I I was concerned you know
having a big baby and and he has any complication
in the pregnancy um I was very sad for him that I
may be passing this gene Participant
Gestational age
Most participants reported that they felt more relaxed
about risk and developing pregnancy related problems as
their pregnancy progressed The participants described
pregnancy as having several milestones and completing
each phase seemed to increase their confidence in having
a healthy pregnancy
As time went on it got a little bit easier to feel like I
wasn t at as much risk in terms of the pregnancy
Participant
As I get closer to delivery and I haven t had any
problems I m getting more and more confident and I
feel a little bit better Participant
Toward the end of pregnancy the meaning of older
age as a risk factor for most women with uncomplicated
pregnancies remained simply a number Some women
used phrases such as it was just that number and that s
Perceived control
The majority of women in our study perceived them
selves to be prepared to accept child raising responsibil
ities Participants comments reflected that most of them
had a good sense of internal control both over their life
situations and their health Considering the pregnancy
related anxiety and risk perception scores of participants
and their explanations it was evident that women with
high perceived control had lower perceived risk The fol
lowing quote was expressed by a year old participant
who had a high perceived control score and a low per
ception of risk score
I just know the way my body responds to things
I understand my body I m very in tune with how my
body works and I can always tell when something s
not right Participant
Conversely low perceived control was often observed
in conjunction with high perceived risk Sometimes the
woman s religious beliefs changed the equation The fol
lowing statement was made by a year old participant
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
who had both low perceived control and low perceived
risk scores
Both of us felt strongly that
um you know we
believe strongly in God and that he was in control
Participant
Poor fertility history
A number of participants mentioned that they lost a
sense of control over their bodies and their own health
to a great extent after enduring infertility experiences
For some women a history of infertility or miscarriage
led to increased risk perception in pregnancy A year
old woman with a high risk perception score and a his
tory of infertility commented
I planned to get pregnant
and I wasn t able to
like the first thing that came to my mind I m not a
life giver it s not because you wanted to get pregnant
at this month you ll get pregnant I am not in control
If I m not given that then I can t do it s beyond my
powers Participant
The emotional impact of previous fertility issues on
the current pregnancy was expressed by words such as
having worry stress and fear For example a year
old woman with a previous miscarriage who had a high
perception of pregnancy risk score stated
I wasn t at risk first but then after I lost the first baby
I thought well maybe this is because I m old I was
stressed I didn t really deal with it Participant
A year old participant believed that infertility treat
ments had a negative impact on her physical health This
belief was also tracked in other participants explanations
with infertility experiences
I think what plays into how I perceive my pregnancy
is is not just my age it s the journey I took to get
here it was because it took four years to get here
and it was a hard four years My body wasn t at risk
I wasn t when we first started trying I was extremely
healthy and in shape and and felt ready and then as I
went through all the fertility procedures my health it
affected my health and I didn t feel myself I didn t
feel as strong as I was so coming into a pregnancy
now where I was coming off of all that fertility stuff it
made me feel like I might be at a higher risk
Participant
Anxiety
Although most participants in this study expressed some
degree of concern for the health and well being of their
babies only a few women were very anxious
Page of
Nevertheless we found that these women often did not
use anxiety as a term to describe their anxious feelings
For instance the following quote comes from a year
old participant who had a high anxiety score
There still is a little bit in the back of my mind once
the baby is born
is the baby going to is everything
going to be okay with the baby and through delivery
and through labor So there is a little bit not anxiety
I wouldn t say anxiety but a little bit of concern
Participant
Being emotional was another term that a year old
participant with a high anxiety score and moderate per
ception of risk score used to express her feelings
I m a little bit emotional I think that s my biggest
been my biggest struggle throughout the entire
pregnancy is my emotional state First with being so
worried and then hormones I wasn t I was depressed
and now I m having trouble sleeping which is causing
a lot of frustration and I m really uncomfortable
Participant
According to participants explanations waiting for
screening results bed rest and limiting physical activities
due to pregnancy complications e g morning sickness
contributed to their risk perception One participant
with a high perceived risk score and a high anxiety score
who experienced morning sickness in early pregnancy
explained
I didn t feel very good for many months so I couldn t
eat I was barfing a lot so that probably added to my
stress being home all day cause I couldn t work and
not being able to eat so that always you know
increases your stress and it lowers your resistance
too Participant
Feeling that this pregnancy might be their last chance
to have a biological child might increase anxiety for
these women and add to the dilemma A year old
participant with a complicated pregnancy who had a
high perception of risk score and a low perceived control
score explained
High risk mostly is or my perception of high risk is
if something happened to myself or my child this
may be my only chance to be pregnant and deliver a
child Participant
Health care providers opinion
Health care providers perspectives about risk and their
reaction to and interpretation of risk had a considerable
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
influence on the women s understandings and assess
ments of their own risk Participants explanations
revealed that health care providers opinions as experts
in risk assessment were viewed as very valuable and re
lied upon by women Although care providers do not
usually disclose their personal opinion women may in
tuit it by observing care providers reactions and body
language Women may include this information in deter
mining of their risk levels especially if there is an uncer
tainty associated with the level of vulnerability As a
year old participant with a low perception of risk
score and a low anxiety score remarked
My family doctor called me to tell me that the baby
has to have an ultrasound after a month but the
doctor here doesn t seem doesn t seem bothered by it
so I don t think it s got anything to do with the baby
having like mental or physical disability of any sorts
I think it s just more just something for them to look
at Participant
Taking into consideration that several participants in
this study reported that they did not have major discus
sions with their health care providers about risks asso
ciated with AMA it might give these women a degree of
confidence that there are no serious concerns
Risk alleviation strategies
Several strategies were reported by the participants to
help them alleviate and or cope with their pregnancy
risk This process for our participants involved edu
cating themselves and engaging in a healthy lifestyle
undertaking reassuring surveillance tests overlooking
the risk relying on religious beliefs and hope and bal
ancing their risk by emphasis on the positive social
aspects of AMA
Educating themselves and engaging in a healthy lifestyle
Some participants spoke of gathering information to
know what actual risks are and to be prepared Partici
pants with low perceived risk scores and high or moder
ate perceived control scores often reported that they had
prepared themselves for pregnancy complications to
not be surprised by risk Participant This year
old participant with a high perceived control score who
perceived a low risk for her pregnancy stated
I m healthy I m fine and I ve prepared myself I ve
educated myself Yeah I think it would be less
stressful if I were younger because I wouldn t have
to educate myself so much I would have educated
myself but I feel like I had to do that extra little bit of
research because I was in that high risk group I was
in that you know more chance of something going
Page of
wrong group So I educated myself a little bit more
Participant
These participants were also focused on improving
their lifestyle and engaging in healthy behaviors to pro
tect their pregnancies
Reassuring surveillance tests
Because most women were aware of the association be
tween genetic problems and older maternal age receiv
ing reassuring screening test results was reported as a
relieving factor A desire to seek actual and tangible
signs of the baby s health to confirm that it s a normal
baby was evident in the interviews
When I had one ultrasound and I saw that
everything was okay he was developing okay then I
had the tests done the blood test I said okay he s a
normal baby so I stopped worrying Participant
Some participants chose to take screening tests as part
of their preparation to deal with anticipatory issues and
to decrease concerns related to fetal health Based on
several participants explanations undertaking screening
tests was a reflection of their desire to plan and be
prepared
We just wanted to do it for our own sake of mind
just for our own peace of mind I like planning my
life I like preparing for things I like being educated
and ready for whatever I wanted to know if I m going
to have a baby with Down s syndrome I want to know
so that I m prepared so that I can educate myself as
to what this baby s needs are going to be At least if
you ve prepared a little bit you might be able to
handle it differently Participant
Overlooking ignoring the risk
Some participants reported an inclination to disregard
the risk to avoid excessive stress and anxiety In fact
overlooking the risk was a very common approach
among our participants even among those who edu
cated themselves and were engaged in a healthy lifestyle
I ve been trying not to let research or other reports
or what I read influence my way of thinking
know they exist I m not saying that ignorance is bliss
but I just don t focus on it Participant
The following quote from a year old participant
who had both a low perceived risk score and a low per
ceived control score describes this approach She and
her partner decided not to undergo genetic screening
tests
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
I did a fair bit of reading but then at the same time I
also got to a point where when I was pregnant I put
the reading aside because I just found it was
starting to increase a lot of anxiety about all the
things that could go wrong or be wrong
considering my age and considering the risks
didn t want to go into the constant anxiety about it
we didn t want to be ignorant about it like we we did
all our research and awareness uh like I said we
made sure we were eating healthy but I mean other
than that there s not much else you can do you
can t it s out of our control
once we talked
Page of
I would say right now I was not emotionally prepared
at that time to have a baby
I was not strong a
strong woman that I m right now I have much more
to offer my son now than if I was young
Participant
I do think that I would probably have more energy
ten years ago but at the same time emotionally I
wasn t ready I was immature and irresponsible still
ten years ago Now I m more mature and more
emotionally ready for it Participant
Communication with health professionals

of our hands Participant
cases there was not a discussion about other age related
risks On the other hand most women preferred not to
Religious beliefs and hope
initiate risk communication They reported receiving
Religious beliefs and hope were other alleviating factors
extra information about risk associated with older age as
described by some participants They reported that these
pointless and most likely stressful and anxiety provoking
beliefs helped them to stay calm and feel that they were
because they knew they would not be able to change
not alone A woman with a high perceived risk score
their risk factor age
and a low anxiety score commented that
I was aware and I knew and he was extremely open
I think my my faith in in God somehow kind of like
to questions he s very approachable so I knew that if
helps me go to sleep at night you know like I mean I
I had concerns or if I had questions about it I could
Participant
pray
talk to him but I didn t feel the need Participant
Another participant with a high perceived risk score
Some women reported having negative communica
and a moderate anxiety score expressed that her reli
tion with health professionals as reflected by the follow
gious beliefs were important in how she dealt with the
ing quote from a year old participant with a low risk
risk This participant had a low perceived control score
pregnancy
and decided not to undergo genetic screening tests
I think that s a matter of our faith and our belief um
that you know I mean if God created this child if
God chooses to take this child then that s his decision
to make and not ours so we re not playing God by
taking that child s life Participant
Emphasis on positive social aspects of AMA
A tendency to emphasize positive aspects of pregnancy
at older age emerged during the interviews From some
of our participants perspectives an older age improved
their readiness to be a parent by having an established
Um the lady that gave me the ultrasound I think she
was judging me a bit for being older cause she did
ask me you know if I had taken all the extra screening
and I told her no and I don t think she was too
impressed by that and then
she s like I think
people that have babies when they re really old that s
just unethical
and so I definitely got from her that
uh you know she was judging me a bit for being older
Participant
Some participants found risk discussions with their
health care provider stressful In reviewing participants
relationship and career being mature both emotionally
statements and their anxiety scores it was apparent that
and personally and developing problem solving skills
anxiety may influence the way a pregnant woman inter

pants who had moderate perceived risk scores
There s a risk and it s high risk But if if you ask me
if I would prefer being pregnant at this age or at
participant who had both a high anxiety score and a high

I was scared after talking to the genetic counselor for
sure The nurse with my GP always mentioned it
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
every visit she would say well you do have high risks
because of your age Every week I know my age you
don t have to keep driving the point home Cause I
had a lot of fear actually when I was meeting with the
genetic counselor and with the nurse at my family
doctor s office I was strongly encouraged to go for
genetic counseling because of my advanced age The
terminology that the doctors and nurses and
everybody used advanced age advanced age I m not
eighty but okay I suppose I m over And they
would show me charts like oh this is how your risk
increases once you ve reached and you kind of feel
a fear that you know something s going to go wrong
cause you re over And the genetic counselor drew
all these charts and showed me my risk But after the
genetic counseling and the results came back from all
the tests it turns out I have an extremely low risk so
I m not sure why they try to scare you like that
Participant
Discussion
The definition of risk for women of AMA similar to
that of pregnant women of other ages had a
broader scope than merely medical risks or physical
challenges and was influenced by various social and per
sonal characteristics The findings described above eluci
dated that this definition also incorporates consideration
of the extent of the woman s support network her ability
to control situations and whether she had an established
relationship a planned pregnancy a flexible job or
healthy lifestyle and behavior These findings support
the position that approaches to understanding percep
tion of health risks should be comprehensive and broad
and suggest that risk communication will benefit
from including women s criteria for defining risk
As is the case in previous research pregnancy at
AMA was frequently acknowledged by women to be
high risk due to an increased risk of genetic abnormal
ities however other medical risks associated with AMA
received less consideration In our study the informa
tion quests in which women sought out a wide
range of information were commonly reported in the
preconception period After becoming pregnant how
ever women mostly limited seeking information to avoid
increased anxiety and were focused on risk reducing be
havior instead In contrast to findings of Carolan Nel
son who reported that their Australian
participants realized they were at higher risk only after
becoming pregnant and through communication with
their health care providers women in our study
described risks associated with AMA as common know
ledge in society This finding is consistent with the find
ing of another Canadian study
Page of
Findings elucidated that nulliparous women aged
years or older were not a homogenous group in their
pregnancy risk assessment The data described above
suggest that the perception of pregnancy risk may be a
result of interactions among several factors including
physiological and psychological elements characteristics
of the experienced risk and feedback from health care
providers Despite the fact that our respondents were
mostly aware of risks associated with pregnancy at age
years or older the majority of them did not consider
themselves to be high risk This apparent disconnect can
be explained by the fact that people typically tend to rate
their personal risk lower in comparison to general risk
This underestimation of personal risk or unrealis
tic optimism might be related to one s perceived
control over a potential risk A link has been identi
fied between perceived control and risk perception in
previous research In our study those participants
who believed they had good control over their physical
health also perceived a lower risk for their pregnancy It
was also noted that a woman s perceived control over
her health may be important in engaging in various
behaviors to maintain the balance between risk and
health To support this point a relationship between
perceived control and health service utilization has been
documented in previous research
Previous prenatal loss was recently documented as a
predictor of depression and anxiety in subsequent preg
nancies independent of other psychosocial and obstetric
factors Our findings highlighted that having a poor
reproductive history contributes to increased perceived
risk of pregnancy Failure to become pregnant in initial
attempts or previous loss of pregnancy may have threa
tened these women s beliefs in their abilities to manage
their own health and may lead to increased anxiety and
higher risk perception This statement is supported by
Campbell Dunkel Schetter Peplau who
reported that infertility may be perceived as a threat to
an infertile person s life s goals contributing to a low
perception of control Based on our data pregnancy
complications could alter risk perception depending on
the type of complication its manageability and its con
sequences for a woman s daily life Alternatively good
physical health and engaging in healthy behaviors and
lifestyles were perceived as risk alleviating factors This
finding echoes that of Gerend et al who reported
that personal health actions from the women s perspec
tives can reduce their risk
Concerns about fetal health and well being particu
larly genetic abnormalities were very common among
our participants as they have been found to be in other
studies Although having several fetal sur
veillance tests helped reassure women about their baby s
health as Baillie et al have noted for a number
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
of women feelings of anxiety may remain throughout
the pregnancy Hoping for a desirable pregnancy
outcome despite having higher perceived risk and anx
iety levels was evident in our data This discrepancy may
lead to feelings of uncertainty Sun et al in a
qualitative study of women of AMA reported similar
ambivalent and conflicted feelings characterized by ap
parent pleasure and hidden fear This attitude has
been referred as a jubilant apprehension by Yuan et al
that describes feelings of great joy and satisfac
tion but also worry about childbirth outcomes
Feelings of anxiety were described vaguely by our par
ticipants and there were notable variations among parti
cipants in expressing and wording their anxiety This
attitude may make the detection of anxiety in these
women a challenge There is evidence that antenatal
anxiety is very prevalent and can increase the odds of
postnatal depression Therefore identification of
women with anxiety is crucial so that effective interven
tions can be targeted appropriately Healthcare providers
should be aware that some women with high levels of
anxiety tend to use different terms to communicate
these feelings Although creating a relaxed environment
and establishing a non judgmental communication pat
tern in prenatal care visits may be beneficial for anxious
women in disclosing their actual feelings about potential
risks there is growing evidence suggesting that prenatal
screening should also include screening for both depres
Sion and anxiety We support this perspective
and believe that using a reliable screening tool to assess
anxiety in pregnant women may be useful to identify
women who would benefit from strategies to reduce
anxiety A recent study in Australia demonstrated that
the anxiety subscale of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depres
Sion Scale might be a reliable measure to screen ante
natal anxiety
Women experienced a decrease in their perceived risk
with advancing gestational weeks which could be due to
women becoming adapted to the state of being pregnant
or becoming more positive about the outcome of their
pregnancy as it advanced An uncomplicated pregnancy
and favorable screening results may contribute to
decreased perception of risk over the course of preg
nancy as well A decline in worry about the baby s health
from early pregnancy to the postpartum period has been
reported in previous research
Consistent with research in other fields our results
demonstrated that pregnant women s personal or vicari
ous experience with a risk may increase the psycho
logical availability of the risk and consequently its
perceived probability In fact being familiar with
risk through researching information or indirect experi
ences may contribute to women s risk perception In the
literature the perceived characteristics of the risk such
Page of
as prevalence controllability preventability and serious
ness along with the availability and representativeness
heuristics are important elements in constructing risk
perception Our findings point to the predictabil
ity of risk as a critical characteristic of risk in which pre
dicting the risk and expecting it influenced participants
risk perception A risk that is expected may be perceived
as less risky than an unexpected risk suggesting that
clear communication is essential to help women have
realistic expectations about their individual risk A quali
tative study by Patterson demonstrated that an
unexpected shift in health situation or pregnancy out
comes was identified as a high risk condition by pregnant
women while the expected changes were considered as
no risk One explanation is that anticipating the risk
and being prepared to deal with it may increase a
woman s perceived control and consequently decrease
her risk perception
While discrepancies between pregnant women s and
health care providers appraisals of risk have been docu
mented in previous research what appears to be
less emphasized is the influence of health care providers
attitudes towards the risk on pregnant women s risk per
ception Several women in this study reported not hav
ing any risk communication with their health care
providers that focused on age as a risk factor This has
been interpreted by most participants as there not being
any serious concern and may imply that pregnant
women trust their health care provider s opinion In this
regard Heaman et al reported that women with
or without pregnancy complications rely on their health
care providers in assessing risk status A few participants
reported negative risk communication with their health
care providers These participants also had higher anx
iety and concern about the well being of their fetus and
pregnancy outcomes Whether risk communication pat
terns can increase the anxiety or whether anxiety itself
will alter women s interpretation of risk communication
is not clear and needs further research In literature a
link between maternal depression and higher perception
of teratogenic risk has been reported
Implications
In the experience of our participants any emphasis on
the mother s good health by their care providers was
described as reassuring Conversely negative messages
about age by purely emphasizing pregnancy risks asso
ciated with AMA were described as very destructive and
challenging particularly for women with high levels of
anxiety These findings indicate that although offering
risk information is part of the risk communication
process the woman s mental health should be consid
ered to avoid unnecessary stress
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
Comparison was a common risk appraisal strategy
among our participants However women s evaluations
were distinct from those of health professionals in that
the participants often compared their risk to a known
population such as their family members friends or
stories from real people which is entirely different from
risks determined by epidemiological studies using popu
lation data This disjuncture stems at least in part from
the fact that pregnant women s understanding of risk is
mostly based on their life experiences suggesting
that real stories can alter risk perception This finding
has important implications for practice and public health
education Risk must be tangible in order to be recog
nized and potentially addressed by women Interventions
to decrease unhealthy behaviors should target this con
cept to alter risk perception As Williamson Weyman
suggested when individuals have less experience
or knowledge of risks the media e g documentary
movies can play an important role in increasing their
understanding of those risks
One of the strengths of the study was the addition of
quantitative measures i e perception of pregnancy risk
anxiety and perceived control and the inclusion of a
variety of perspectives from women of AMA with vary
ing levels of risk perception anxiety and perceived con
trol This diversity in the sample allowed for the
documentation of variations in risk appraisal and also
the identification of important issues that were common
across participants Another major strength was the con
temporaneous exploration of risk perception during the
pregnancy It is important to consider the following lim
itations when interpreting and applying the results First
our sample was representative of a middle class and
married population these characteristics may limit the
generalization of the results This is a small study based
on interviews in one geographical area in Canada
therefore the results may not be generalizable to other
populations Finally we recognize that selection bias
may have been introduced as a purposeful sampling
method was employed and those who volunteered to

Conclusion
Pregnancy at age years or older within a healthy con
text and in the absence of other risk factors was per
ceived as a low risk pregnancy by the majority of our
participants However in the presence of risk factors
such as pregnancy complications limited physical activ
ity unfavorable screening tests results previous poor re
productive history and anxiety the risk associated with
age was highlighted and women were inclined to
recognize their age as a risk factor for their pregnancy
This study adds to the literature on perception of

pregnancy risk by identifying several factors that influ
ence the perception of pregnancy risk Understanding of
these influential factors may help health care providers
who care for pregnant women aged years or older to
gain insight into their perspectives on pregnancy risk
and improve the effectiveness of risk communication

Abstract

Background Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a complex process influenced by multiple personal
psychological and societal factors Traditionally the risk perception of healthcare professionals has been presented as
more objective and authoritative than that of pregnant women Doctors have been presented as more concerned with
biomedical risk than midwives Such dichotomies oversimplify and obscure the complexity of the process This study
examines pregnancy related risk perception in women and healthcare professionals and what women and professionals
believe about each other s risk perception
Methods A cross sectional survey of set in UK maternity services Participants were doctors working in obstetrics N
midwives N pregnant women N Participants were recruited in person from two hospitals Doctors
were also recruited online Participants completed a questionnaire measuring the degree of perceived risk in
various childbirth related scenarios and the extent to which they believed others agreed with them about the degree
of risk generally involved in childbirth Main outcome measures were the degree of risk perceived to the mother in
baby in pregnancy scenarios and beliefs about own perception of risk in comparison to their own group and other
groups
Results There were significant differences in total risk scores between pregnant women doctors and midwives in
perception of risk to the mother in scenarios Doctors most frequently rated risks lowest Total scores for
perceived risk to the baby were not significantly different There was substantial variation within each group There was
more agreement on the ranking of scenarios according to risk Each group believed doctors perceived most
risk whereas actually doctors most frequently rated risks lowest Each group incorrectly believed their peers
rated risk similarly to themselves
Conclusions Individuals cannot assume others share their perception of risk or that they make correct assessments
regarding others risk perception Further research should consider what factors are taken into account when making
risk assessments
Background
Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a
complex process based on multiple factors It is in
fluenced by factors pertaining to risk perception beyond
the subject of childbirth and pregnancy specific factors
Factors involved in general risk perception include the
degree of perceived control involved in undertaking the
risk activity the ways in which information about the

risk is presented and the degree of trust placed in the
source of the information Factors specific to preg
nant women include the extent to which women view
childbirth as benefitting from medical management and
common concerns for the wellbeing of their babies
The two main discourses within which childbirth can
be understood also each have different approaches to
risk The biomedical model regards birth as inherently
risky whereas the social model regards pregnancy
risk as a concept constructed from multiple cultural and
personal factors Risk in the biomedical model is
generally presented in terms of potential physiological

outcomes whereas the social model recognises a more
holistic definition encompassing potential threats to
psychological and social wellbeing In line with these
discourses views of maternity healthcare professionals
have often been presented in a polarised fashion typically
doctors are presented as supporting the medical model
and midwives the social model Doctors educa
tion has frequently focussed on birth as a biomechanical
process whereas midwives may consider it in more holistic
terms However presenting these approaches as
entrenched opposites oversimplifies the issue Such
dichotomous depictions overlook the fact all healthcare
professionals are likely to be aiming to provide high qual
ity healthcare and ensure positive outcomes and may
well move along the spectrum between approaches
Accounts of risk perception should also consider women s
perspectives In contemporary Western culture women s
understanding of birth has typically been portrayed as more
subjective and less well informed than that of professionals
However women s perception of risk often transcends
the medical and social models as they act from unique and
individual perspectives of their own circumstances The
portrayal of lay persons perceptions of risk in relation to
birth has also been simplified and polarised with profes
sional perceptions of risk often characterised as objective
and logical and lay assessments as more emotion based
Again such dichotomous terms obscure and oversim
plify the differences and similarities of risk perception
between lay and professional groups Perception of risk by
members of both groups will entail an assessment of numer
ical odds but also be contingent on personal experience
context and interactions with others
However research examining lay and medical risk per
ception does find differences A review of quantitative
risk perception research found little correlation between
perceptions held by healthcare professionals and of preg
nant women with regard to pregnancy and childbirth
Qualitative research has similarly shown differences
in the way professionals and women define concepts of
risk and safety However there is little research in
this area and existing studies have used different criteria
for assessing risk perception of professionals and women
making them difficult to compare and reinforcing the idea
the groups assess risk in different ways
The aim of this study is therefore to examine
pregnancy related risk perception in women and mater
nity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society using a unified assessment tool to enable direct
comparison and to examine what women and profes
sionals believe about each other s risk perception This
study will contribute to the understanding of risk per
ception and inform professionals seeking to understand
awareness of risk and improve communication with
pregnant women
Method
Design
We conducted a cross sectional study of risk perception
in regard to pregnancy and childbirth by administering a
questionnaire see Additional file to doctors midwives
and pregnant women
Participants
A sample of pregnant women midwives and doctors was
recruited from two NHS Trusts organisations providing
state funded healthcare and utilised by the majority of the
population in South East England Seventy eight pregnant
women were approached and completed ques
tionnaires Fifty nine midwives completed the question
naire of those approached Initial uptake of the
study was low among doctors n of those
approached so recruitment was extended for this group
The final sample for analyses was pregnant women
midwives and doctors Doctors and midwives were
comparable in terms of time since qualification doctors
mean time years SD range to years
midwives mean time years SD range month
to years t p The midwives worked
in obstetric units and community settings neither trust
involved in the study has a midwifery led unit
Inclusion criteria for healthcare professionals were a
recognised medical or midwifery qualification and cur
rently working as a doctor or midwife in a UK maternity
service This allowed for participation by junior doctors
not specialising in obstetrics but currently on an obstetric
placement Pregnant women had to be between and
weeks pregnant and aged or over to participate
Recruitment occurred between June and April
Participants were initially recruited through two
NHS trusts in South East England However difficulties
recruiting doctors to the study meant it was necessary to
extend recruitment to include any doctor practising
obstetrics in the UK These additional participants were
recruited via social media and completed the study
online
Pregnant women were approached by a researcher
while waiting for their mid pregnancy anomaly scan All
women in the UK are offered this scan so this time was
chosen to reach the maximum number of women They
were given verbal and written information about the
study and reassurance about confidentiality If they
agreed to participate they completed the questionnaire
straight away and returned it to the researcher Informa
tion about the study was placed in the maternity depart
ments for doctors and midwives along with copies of the
questionnaire for them to complete at their convenience
Researchers also visited the maternity units to provide
further information and approach staff in person Con
sent agreed as part of the ethics approval for the study

was considered indicated by completion of the question
naire All participants received information about the
study explaining the procedure
Measures
The questionnaire consisted of two elements The first
measured risk in relation to pregnancy and childbirth sce
narios items and was adapted from the work of Gray
a who used a similar scale to measure risk perception
in relation to hospitalisation in pregnancy Each item in the
first element briefly described a pregnancy or birth sce
nario e g a woman who has a minor postpartum haemor
rhage at home a woman giving birth in a birthpool in
hospital Participants were asked to rate how much risk
they perceived each scenario represented to the wellbeing
of i the mother and ii the fetus baby Participants were
provided with a definition of risk as a possible degree of
threat to physical or psychological wellbeing This defin
ition was intended to allow participants to formulate their
own interpretations of scenarios as far as possible Three
obstetricians three midwives and six pregnant women
assisted in the development and piloting of the question
naire to ensure user acceptability and face validity
All participants received the same questionnaire but the
version for pregnant women also included definitions of
medical terms e g shoulder dystocia pre eclampsia etc
taken from the NHS Choices or Royal College of Obstetri
cians and Gynaecologists websites Participants indicated
the degree of risk perceived using a visual analogue scale
a mm line representing a continuum from minimal
risk to extreme risk The distance from the beginning of
the scale to participants marks was measured and the
resulting millimetre measurement became the risk score
for each question minimum score O maximum score
Risks to mother and baby were scored separately
providing total possible risk scores of for risk to
mother and for risk to baby scenarios maximum
score per scenario
The second element looked at participants comparison
of their own perceived risk with other groups items
Participants were asked to compare the extent to which
they believed others agreed with them about the degree of
risk generally involved in pregnancy and birth A seven
point Likert scale was used ranging from they think it
is a lot less risky than I do to they think it is a lot
more risky than I do A score of therefore indicated they
believed the comparison group agreed with them about
the degree of risk Participants first compared themselves
with members of their own group other doctors mid
wives or pregnant women and then with the remaining
two groups
The primary outcomes were degree of perceived risk
and perception of own sense of risk in comparison to
others in their own group and other groups

Sample size calculations based on the likelihood of
detecting a medium effect size estimated a sample of
doctors midwives and pregnant women was needed
for the study to be adequately powered to find a difference
in the primary outcomes power significance
Doctors and midwives were also asked how long they
had held their medical or midwifery qualification
Analysis
Analysis was conducted using SPSS version
Kolmogorov Smirnov and Levene s tests were conducted
to test for normal distribution and homogeneity of vari
ance ANOVA was used to test for differences in total
scores between groups The data were found to be skewed
for scores on individual items so the non parametric
Kruskal Wallis test was used to test for differences between
the groups
Results
Doctors midwives and pregnant women s total mean
scores of overall perceived risk to the mother and baby
are shown in Table
Overall mean risk scores were low to moderate for
mother and baby ranging from from a
possible score of Doctors reported the lowest
mean scores There were significant differences between
groups for risk to the mother but not for risk to the
baby Post hoc tests revealed significant differences for
perceived risk to the mother between doctors and mid
wives mean difference SE p and
doctors and pregnant women mean difference

nant women mean difference SE p
Across individual risk scenarios however there was little
agreement between the groups on the perceived degree of
risk see Additional file Regarding risk to the mother
scenarios showed significant differences between
the groups p and only showed no signifi
cant differences in risk scores p There was
also little agreement in scores on risk to the baby sce
narios showed a significant difference between the

slightly fewer scenarios highest mothers risk of

However although there was variation between groups
in the risk scores assigned to the mothers and babies in
the scenarios there were similarities across the groups
when the scenarios were ranked in order of degree of
perceived risk The highest ranking scenarios are
shown in Table for risk to mothers and Table for
risk to babies Six scenarios were consistently rated high

groups Four scenarios were consistently rated highest

while there was frequent disagreement about the degree
of risk posed in each scenario there was more consensus
about the scenarios that posed the greatest risk to
mothers and babies
Mean scores for participants estimations of how their
peers and members of the other groups would rate risk in
comparison to their own ratings are displayed in Table
Each group believed their peers agreed with them about
the degree of risk generally involved in pregnancy and
childbirth Doctors believed midwives perceived birth as a
little less risky than they did and pregnant women per
ceived it as somewhat less risky Midwives believed doc
tors perceived pregnancy and birth as somewhat more
risky and pregnant women as a little less risky than they
did Pregnant women believed doctors agreed with them
about the degree of risk involved in pregnancy and birth
Their mean score for comparison with midwives fell
between midwives believing birth is a little less risky and
agreeing with the degree of risk

This study aimed to examine risk perception in relation
to pregnancy and childbirth in pregnant women and ma
ternity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society and to examine what pregnant women and pro
fessionals believe about the risk perceptions of each
other Results showed there were differences in risk per
ception in relation to pregnancy and birth within and
between pregnant women doctors and midwives When
rating risk of different scenarios to mothers there were
significant differences between pregnant women doctors
and midwives for out of pregnancy related scenar
iOS This was less marked when rating risks for babies
where overall mean risk scores were not significantly dif
ferent between groups but there were differences in the
scores of out of scenarios While assessments of
the degree of risk pertaining to scenarios differed there
was more agreement on the ranking of scenarios accord
ing to risk Interestingly when comparing their own rat
ings of risk to others each group incorrectly believed
their peers rated risk similarly to themselves These
beliefs were not supported by the first part of the study
The mean risk score for each group and in particular
the doctors had large standard deviations indicating a
wide range of scores within groups see Table Each
group also believed doctors perceived most risk in preg
nancy and birth However where there were significant
differences in scores for individual scenarios where doc
tors consistently rated the risks lower than women and
midwives in The results of this study are consistent with
previous research showing pregnant women think about
risk differently to healthcare professionals It showed
pregnant women had the highest risk perception scores

risk especially concerning the birth process and the
wellbeing of their babies While this may appear
concerning these fears are not necessarily perceived
negatively by women however and though common are
often not perceived as very intense or intrusive They
may be viewed as an integral part of pregnancy which
confers an element of protection by motivating women
to speak out about their concerns Thus while
women acknowledge pregnancy and birth may involve a
degree of risk they also utilise psychological strategies to
manage these concerns and may tolerate greater degrees
of risk than professionals recommend or would be pre
pared to tolerate for themselves if they believe doing so
will result in a better outcome for themselves and their
babies Within the professionals risk assess
ments midwives also rated risks to mothers significantly
higher than doctors While midwifery care is based on
the assumption and promotion of normality in preg
nancy much midwifery activity is focussed on concerns
regarding the abnormal so creating a degree of tension
and disjunction between rhetoric and practice
This study found differences between the risk percep
tion of pregnant women and healthcare professionals It
was beyond the scope of the study to investigate potential
reasons for these differences but they have traditionally
been attributed to women s more subjective less
knowledge based understanding of risk However
such a distinction may be misplaced emotion imagination
and intuition are components of all perceptions of risk
and so are likely to influence women and professionals
alike alongside an assessment of objective knowledge
Healthcare professionals have been shown to consider

the degree of the patient s anxiety their own clinical ex
perience particularly that based on borderline or espe
cially interesting cases and negative outcomes and the
opinions of trusted colleagues when making decisions re
garding risk They actively interpret evidence
based guidelines according to their own and the patient s
individual circumstances rather than follow them abso
lutely Rather than differentiating between lay subjective
inferior and professional objective authoritative under
standing of risk it may be more appropriate to acknow
ledge both groups rely on different types of understanding
systematic intuitive experiential and tacit when making
judgements about risk Further research is needed to
establish how maternity professionals combine subjective
and objective elements of risk perception It may also be
the case that doctors become habituated to situations in
volving greater degrees of risk as they make up the majority
of their practice and utilise their obstetric skills
The midwives and doctors in this study demonstrated
some differences in risk perception Perceived differences
in approach to risk have been shown to be a factor which
can lead to tension between maternity care professionals
and feelings of lack of trust and support Such tension
maybe interpreted as conflict by service users and cause
them some anxiety The members of each group in
this study believed their peers agreed with them about the
degree of risk involved in pregnancy and childbirth
although the results did not support this belief In all com
munication individuals typically overestimate the extent
to which others share their beliefs and interpretation of
events This false consensus effect is particularly
evident in situations deemed important in this instance

healthcare These factors can lead to misinterpreted com
munication and conflict so maternity care profes
sionals should be aware of their potential influence in
communication with members of their own discipline as
well as others and pregnant women
This study demonstrates risk perception in relation to
pregnancy and birth is a complex and individual process
It challenges the stereotypical depictions of doctors and
midwives in regard to their perception of risk This has
implications for how professionals perceive their own and
others roles and how they communicate with each other
and with women in their care Traditional distinctions
between the quality of professional and lay approaches to
risk oversimplify the process and may devalue women s
understanding of their circumstances and contribution to
their car Recognising all parties have a common goal
and speaking openly about factors influencing risk percep
tion may enhance relationships with women and col
leagues This in turn has been demonstrated to have
a positive effect on outcomes for women and babies
This is the first study to explore the risk perception of
doctors midwives and pregnant women using a compar
able measure It adds to the understanding of how the
different groups assess risk their beliefs about the risk per
ception of their peers and others and has implications
regarding communication within and between groups It
will contribute to the understanding of risk perception and
the conceptualisation of risk It will increase knowledge of
risk perception in different groups and their beliefs about
each other and challenge unhelpful stereotypes It will
inform professionals working in maternity care and seeking
to understand awareness of risk and improve communica
tion with pregnant women and provide information for
women utilising maternity care
Strengths of this study include using the same mea
sures for each group to allow direct comparisons of risk
perception across groups The study was developed with
input from maternity service users obstetricians and
midwives ensuring its credibility and acceptability The
sampling strategy ensured the inclusion of pregnant
women with different degrees and experiences of risk in
their own pregnancies and healthcare professionals
working in different areas of maternity care with varying
lengths of time qualified to provide a range of potential
perspectives on risk A limitation of the study was the dif
ficulty recruiting doctors and need to include participants
recruited online The final sample therefore included doc
tors from other areas so the group was potentially more
heterogeneous and self selected than were the groups of
pregnant women and midwives The relatively small num
bers of doctors and midwives who ultimately participated
in the study mean further work is needed to establish how
representative their perceptions of risk are and the extent
to which the findings are generalisable Although efforts
Page of
were made to ensure face validity the questionnaire has
not been formally validated so further work is needed to
establish the extent to which it accurately represents per
ception of risk and the extent to which these perceptions
manifest in behaviour Finally between group differences
were tested for all individual scenarios and multiple
comparisons increase the probability that some of the
significant findings occurred by chance It is therefore
important to replicate and extend this research
Conclusions
Assessment of risk is a complex activity comprised of
objective and subjective elements All individuals making
an assessment of risk will rely on these elements to dif
fering extents depending on the particular context Indi
viduals cannot assume others share their perception of
risk or that they make correct assessments regarding the
risk perception of others
Healthcare professionals should be aware of these con
siderations when communicating with pregnant women
and also with other professionals Communication with
women should include sensitive and respectful exploration
of their understanding and perception of risk and safety
and acknowledgement of any anxieties When communi
cating with members of their own discipline professionals
should not make assumptions that colleagues will share
their perceptions They should be mindful of the subject
ivity of their own risk assessments and factors which may
influence their perceptions rather than attempting to elim
inate or deny the effects of some of these influences They
should challenge their own and others stereotypical
assumptions about the perception of risk in other disci
plines and ensure interdisciplinary communication is
based on professional respect and genuine understanding
Further research is needed to consider what factors
professionals and pregnant women take into account
when making risk assessments in relation to pregnancy
and birth and how they use these factors to formulate
their assessments It should also examine which ele
ments of pregnancy and birth are perceived as most
risky what it is about them which causes concern and
the extent to which evidence exists to support these
perceptions Qualitative research should explore health
care professionals and pregnant women s understanding
and awareness of their perceptions of risk Research is
needed to establish how perception of risk influences
professionals communication with women the barriers
to effective risk communication and how this communi
cation can be improved Research into interprofessional
working should explore how stereotypical expectations
about the risk perception of other groups arise can

Overdose Risks and Prevention
Strategies for Pregnant Women in
New York City
Bethany Medley
Introduction
Like many countries around the world the United States is in the midst of an
overdose crisis Since an estimated people in the United States have
died of an overdose with the majority of those deaths involving opioids Center
for Disease Control and Prevention While men account for a greater num
ber of overdose fatalities the prevalence of overdose is increasing more rapidly
among women of reproductive age Mazure Fiellin Additionally preg
nant and parenting women are more susceptible to unique risk factors compared
to their male counterparts such as limited access to reproductive healthcare
stressful child welfare interventions and increased stigma within healthcare set
tings Although harm reduction services including overdose prevention emphasise
compassionate and evidence based approaches for mitigating drug related harm
these services services are rarely designed with the various needs of pregnant
and parenting women in mind Gender responsive harm reduction approaches
must take into account factors within the nexus of relevant social systems i e
the criminal justice system women s healthcare and the child welfare system
Developing harm reduction and overdose prevention strategies for women of
reproductive age who may experience pregnancy during their drug use trajectory
is a critical area of need that require collaborative efforts with those with lived
experience Using excerpts from interviews with three women who had experi
enced pregnancy and drug use in New York City this chapter seeks to highlight

the importance of inclusive gender responsive overdose prevention and shared
expertise from those with lived experience
Women Who Use Drugs as Overdose Responders
The widespread availability of naloxone the medication used to reverse an opioid
overdose is essential in curbing the current opioid overdose crisis Naloxone is
safe and has no potential for abuse so there is little to no risks in allowing non
medical personnel to administer the medication Burris Norland Edlin
Research shows that training and distribution of naloxone to individuals likely
to witness an overdose can significantly reduce overdose mortality Siegler et al
New York City has made laudable efforts to increase naloxone training
and distribution to relevant community based organisations in order to make this
available to those that need it the most people who use drugs One participant
shared her expertise as an overdose responder
I don t panic under pressure I m that person that remembers all
the steps you know I can delegate you know You call You
uh you know help me with um you know CPR if we have to
do it because we had to at that point She wasn t breathing So
compressions and breaths and all that It it s helpful when you
have the ability to recruit people into your situation And as long
as you re giving you know concise clear instructions people are
okay You know what I mean If you re like freaking out then it
can turn into a shit show pretty quickly
In New York City dispensed naloxone rescue kits to community
members via registered Opioid Overdose Prevention Programs New York City
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene A significant number of nalox
one rescue kits are dispensed to harm reduction settings Harm reduction settings
are designed to provide low threshold overdose prevention education to people in
the community actively using drugs Harm reduction programmes often operate
in a peer based non judgmental environment Harm reduction programmes also
known as syringe access programmes may also provide other drug user health
resources such as sterile drug consumption equipment fentanyl testing strips con
doms HIV and Hepatitis C testing or low threshold access to buprenorphine
All of the women interviewed were connected to harm reduction services in some
capacity as participants or employees
At the time of this publication drug consumption spaces also known as super
vised injection facilities were not allowed to operate legally in the United States As
a result public bathrooms have often been used as convenient locations for people
to inject drugs due to the privacy availability immediacy and resources i e water
lighting and flat surfaces Thus it is common for people to use drugs in busi
ness locations with private bathroom facilities Wolfson Stofko Bennett Elliott
Curtis Recognising the overdose risk in many neighbourhoods with high
rates of drug use within her community one participant took it upon herself to
educate local business owners on overdose prevention with the use of naloxone
Overdose Risks and Prevention Strategies for Pregnant Women
I ve talked to like McDonald s employers employees and um it s
important that they have it in case they stumble upon somebody in
their public bathroom and that you know that s clearly because of
the equipment on the floor or whatever suffering from an overdose
Like dude administer You can t hurt them You re not gonna make
a mistake Call administer and have somebody else help you
The psychological effects of responding to an overdose for women who use drugs
including the benefits and harms of such an experience are an under researched
topic in overdose prevention literature Participants reported a a feeling of personal
responsibility to respond to an overdose within their community Not only did their
fostered connections at harm reduction programmes provide a supportive social
environment and access to resources but their involvement also provided a benefit to
share overdose prevention education among their peers and community Taking on
the social role of responding to an overdose has shown to provide valuable empow
ering skill sets that include increasing the sense of self confidence and self esteem
Wagner et al At the same time certain negative psychological consequences
should be considered when examining the impact of being an overdose responder
among people who use drugs Research shows the risks of burnout and trauma
among community based responders is rarely considered in current programmatic
support Shearer Fleming Fowler Boyd Mcneil Reflecting on experiences
as community based overdose responders participants shared their thoughts
I don t want to lose a loved one I don t want to lose a best friend
I don t want to lose anybody even if it is a perfect stranger to
know that I could have done something and that I didn t
I ve always been a part of the user community And I feel that they
have user rights and that they should be supported in their use
They should be supported in any changes they want to make They
should be supported period They re human beings
Barriers to Care for Pregnant Women Who Use Drugs
My water broke on the bus
I feel like I m pissing myself but I m
not even peeing So I went to the doctor and they said You know
that you re five months pregnant And I was like What I m five
months pregnant
Sometimes these things just happen because you have like lesser
periods or no periods because of your usage Like it s hard to tell
when you re fucking pregnant to begin with And morning sick
ness and dope sickness resembles you know so you wind up being
many months pregnant when you finally figure it out You know
that s what happened to me every time
As the testimonies above illustrate unexpected pregnancies are common among
women who use opioids Heil et al Drug use especially consistent opioid use
Bethany Medley
may delay or stop menstrual cycles Additionally early pregnancy symptoms i e
vomiting cramping and nausea may be difficult for women who are depend
ent on opioids to differentiate from withdrawal symptoms Jones et al
Furthermore stigmatisation practices towards people who use drugs are common
in healthcare settings Corrigan Kuwabara O Shaughnessy Mendiola
Galetto Fingerhood While research is limited on the impacts of stigma in
healthcare settings among pregnant women who use drugs the participants inter
viewed for this chapter emphasised their experiences of being stigmatised as a lead
ing factor in preventing initial or continued engagement in care
They actually treated me like crap when I told them what my
problem was They didn t even want to help me they didn t want
to hear me All they cared about was um and I understand but
all they cared about was the baby the baby the baby the baby
but okay if the baby is the baby the baby the baby what about
hydrating me so that the baby is well you know
Um it was traumatic I mean he was preemie The nurses were super
mean to me at the hospital You know every time I would go and
and visit you know he was in an incubator I could barely touch
him They d look at me and they d be like Look at him Look look
at what you did to your son So it was fucked up My mom visited
him more in the hospital than I did I just couldn t bear to take my
you know to go because they were just so fucking mean
Like at one point I seriously like like thought about just giving
birth at home Seriously For fear of them taking my child away at
the hospital when and because of the usage and like you know
once you re in the hospital setting like you can t just leave You
can t leave with your child They re gonna take the child because
they re gonna test their first urine And and it s downhill from
there I have no faith in the you know child protective services
people They re liars They you know they they set you up I
I think for for failure So I really considered just having my baby at
home and trying to you know Google that shit like how to have
a home birth Yeah That s how how fearful I was of of losing yet
again another child and not having family there for the support
In addition to the experience of being stigmatised in healthcare settings the
threat of child welfare involvement or possible criminalisation is also a the real
ity for women who use drugs The United States has an extensive history of puni
tive laws towards women who use drugs during pregnancy laws that are primarily
implemented through policing surveillance and child removal by the state Cur
rently punitive laws far outnumber the existing evidence based supportive policies
Thomas TrefTers Berglas Drabble Roberts While no law currently exists
explicitly criminalising drug use during pregnancy states have sought prosecution
against pregnant people who use drugs in a variety of ways such as declaring prenatal
Overdose Risks and Prevention Strategies for Pregnant Women
drug use as a form of child maltreatment doing drug testing without informed con
sent ordering treatment through civil commitment and mandating child welfare
notifications Thomas Treffers Berglas Drabble Roberts While an analysis
of the extent of these punitive policies is beyond the scoop of this article it is clear
that many of these policies violate basic human rights of pregnant women who use
drugs Notably the overwhelming majority of parents involved in drug related child
welfare investigations are primarily low income and disproportionately women of
colour Stone There is no evidence that prosecution or the threat of prosecu
tion deters drug use in pregnancy Patrick Schiff In fact research shows
that the threat of child welfare involvement instead deters many women from seek
ing healthcare including prenatal care supportive social structures evidenced based
drug treatment or overdose prevention Hui Angelotta Fisher Nielsen
et al Stone However opioid use during pregnancy is an easily treatable
temporary and non life threatening condition with no evidence of long term health
consequences for the newborn Mangat Kraft Thus punitive
measures are counterproductive to the health of pregnant women and newborns
Because I think they re at higher risk for overdose because they use
alone they use in secrecy Um you know the baby is is you know
pretty much taking half of what is going in their system so they re
feeling the effects less so they they might increase their amount of
usage which puts them at a higher risk of overdose
The participant s statement above noted several important overdose risk con
siderations specifically for drug using pregnant women an often overlooked
population in overdose prevention education While there is extensive research
in treating opioid use disorder during pregnancy with the use of buprenorphine
or methadone which is also shown to significantly reduce the risk of an opioid
overdose little research exists on responding to an opioid overdose to a preg
nant person with the use of naloxone World Health Organization WHO
There is a critical need to expand overdose prevention education for the pregnant
population Women who are pregnant may use alone due to increased stigma by
drug using peers partners or family members Using alone poses a significant
risk of dying from an overdose since it is unlikely that a bystander could intervene
with the use of naloxone To be clear naloxone should always be administered to
anyone experiencing an overdose regardless of pregnancy Blandthorn Bowman
Leung Bonomo Dietze While none of the interviewed participants had
heard anything about specific considerations when administering naloxone to a
pregnant woman a frequent inquiry at overdose prevention trainings all par
ticipants were correct when assuming pregnancy should never be a reason not to
give someone naloxone based on the medication s life saving purpose
But it s better to have someone alive whether they re pregnant or
not than to have someone two people dead as opposed to two
people the mother overdosing and the fetus dying in the process
Additionally the postpartum period creates a unique overdose risk for women
who have experienced pregnancy The limited research suggests that some factors
Bethany Medley
associated with overdose in the postpartum period include poor social sup
port inadequate healthcare coverage and recently having an infant experienc
ing neonatal abstinence syndrome Nielsen et al Similarly women may
self medicate with continued or increased drug use due to stress and trauma asso
ciated with the loss of child custody or child welfare involvement as one partici
pant described
The pregnancies where I was using probably increased after birth
only because of the you know just the shitty feeling the depres
Sion associated with the fact that I knew that I wouldn t be able to
take my baby home or be with my baby
Conclusion
This brief documentation sheds light on women not only surviving the overdose
crisis but also the punitive stigmatising multi structural social systems that often
affect intersecting with the lives of pregnant women who use drugs Several areas
of further research and programme development were highlighted including the
need for gender responsive overdose prevention provisions barriers to reproduc
tive health and harm reduction as well as effective interventions with supportive
trauma informed approaches Women who use drugs have proven their expertise
in identifying several devastatingly harmful barriers to their own care and criti
cal life saving interventions Policymakers researchers and practitioners need to
ensure that women are no longer adversely impacted by ineffective and harmful
policies and practices which can be accomplished by collectively increasing advo
cacy efforts to promote the inclusive involvement of women with lived experience
of pregnancy and drug use throughout the development evaluation and imple
mentation of impacting systems and policies

Maternal and Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality Among Pregnant Women With and Without COVID Infection
t the outset of the COVID pandemic the precise ex
tent of the risks in pregnancy was uncertain which was
affecting pregnant individuals mental health
The lack of clarity arose because in an early systematic
review only studies that involved small numbers com
pared outcomes between pregnant women with and without
COVID The question is relevant because of the known
deleterious effects of other coronavirus infections in preg
nancy eg severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East
respiratory syndrome Therefore the INTERGROWTH
Consortium conducted a prospective longitudinal observa
tional study INTERCOVID involving hospitals in coun
tries to assess the association between COVID and mater
nal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID
diagnosis compared with concomitantly enrolled pregnant
women without COVID diagnosis
Methods
Study Design
The Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee and all local
ethics committees approved the study which did not inter

For months from March we enrolled women
years or older at any stage of pregnancy or delivery with the

Key Points
Question To what extent does COVID in pregnancy alter the
risks of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with
pregnant individuals without COVID
Findings In this multinational cohort study of pregnant
women in countries women with COVID diagnosis were at
increased risk of a composite maternal morbidity and mortality
index Newborns of women with COVID diagnosis had
significantly higher severe neonatal morbidity index and severe
perinatal morbidity and mortality index compared with newborns
of women without COVID diagnosis
Meaning This study indicates a consistent association between
pregnant individuals with COVID diagnosis and higher rates of
adverse outcomes including maternal mortality preeclampsia
and preterm birth compared with pregnant individuals without
COVID diagnosis
proached until women without COVID diagnosis were en
rolled per woman with COVID diagnosis We sought con
firmation from a biweekly random sample that the
women without COVID diagnosis were appropriately cho
sen we excluded women who had a COVID diagnosis and
the corresponding women without a COVID diagnosis
without such confirmation Live and stillborn singleton and
multiple pregnancies were included including those with con
genital anomalies However in keeping with reporting require
ments during the pandemic we excluded women neonates
from the final analysis if their data were already published in
any comparative study with women without COVID
diagnosis
Outcomes
The primary were unweighted indices ma
ternal morbidity and mortality index including at least of the
following pregnancy related morbidities third trimester vagi
nal bleeding pregnancy induced hypertension preeclampsia

Data Management and Statistical Analysis
We used a centrally coordinated data management system de
veloped for the INTERGROWTH Project MedSciNet As
sociations between being diagnosed as having COVID and
morbidity mortality indices expressed as binary outcomes
were assessed using Poisson models with a log link function
and robust standard errors expressed as relative risk RR and
Cl Associations with number of days in ICU were as
sessed using negative binomial models with robust standard
errors expressed as an incidence rate ratio and CI We
set statistical significance at P Models for our primary
outcomes were adjusted for country month entering study ma
ternal age and history of maternal morbidity including dia
betes thyroid and other endocrine disorders cardiac dis
ease hypertension chronic respiratory disease kidney disease
malaria or tuberculosis Models with preterm birth as an out
come were also adjusted for previous preterm birth We plotted
Kaplan Meier curves with the percentage of women remain
ing pregnant by gestational age to compare the distributions
between women with and without COVID diagnosis ac
cording to symptom status We evaluated women with
COVID diagnosis for the primary and secondary outcomes
using the women without COVID diagnosis as the refer
ence group We further categorized women with COVID di
agnosis as asymptomatic or symptomatic based on type and
duration of symptoms as well as according to past maternal
morbidity and normal weight or overweight to explore effect
modification We assessed the association of neonates test
ing positive for SARS CoV infection In separate sensitivity
analyses we adjusted for additional potential confounders re
stricted the definition of women with COVID diagnosis to
mothers with a positive laboratory test result and excluded
twins We also performed separate meta analyses for our pri
mary outcomes of interest using the stratified results to esti
mate pooled effects and assess heterogeneity by country
Results
We enrolled women with COVID diagnosis of which

comitant pregnant women without COVID diagnosis from
the same populations carefully enrolled to minimize selec
tion bias
We demonstrated that women with COVID diagnosis
compared with those without COVID diagnosis were at sub
stantially increased risk of severe pregnancy complications
including preeclampsia eclampsia HELLP syndrome ICU ad
mission or referral to higher level of care and infections re
quiring antibiotics as well as preterm birth and low birth
weight The risk of maternal mortality was ie times
higher in the group of women with COVID diagnosis These
deaths were concentrated in institutions from less developed
regions implying that when comprehensive ICU services are
not fully available COVID in pregnancy can be lethal Re
assuringly we also found that asymptomatic women with
COVID diagnosis had similar outcomes to women without
COVID diagnosis except for preeclampsia
Importantly women with COVID diagnosis already at
high risk of preeclampsia and COVID because of preexist
ing overweight diabetes hypertension and cardiac and
chronic respiratory diseases had almost times greater risk
of developing preeclampsia eclampsia which could reflect the
known association with these comorbidities and or the acute
kidney damage that can occur in patients with COVID
Our data support reports of an association between
COVID and higher rates of preeclampsia eclampsia
HELLP syndrome but it is still uncertain whether COVID
manifests in pregnancy with a preeclampsialike syndrome or
infection with SARS CoV results in an increased risk for pre
eclampsia Uncertainty persists because the placentas of
women with COVID compared with controls show vascu
lar changes consistent with preeclampsia but the state of
systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability found in non
pregnant patients with severe illness and COVID is also a
feature of preeclampsia
It is known that in nonpregnant patients distinct sub
types may be predictive of clinical outcomes We found the
presence of any COVID symptoms was associated with in
creased morbidity and mortality Specifically severe preg
nancy and neonatal complication rates were highest in women
if fever and shortness of breath were present reflecting sys
temic disease their presence for to days was associated with

c SPMMI includes any of the morbidities listed in the SNMI intrauterine or

severe maternal and neonatal complications This observa
tion should influence clinical care and referral strategies
The risks of severe neonatal complications including
NICU stay for days or longer as well as the summary index
of severe neonatal morbidity and its individual components
were also substantially higher in the group of women with
COVID diagnosis The increased neonatal risk remained
after adjusting for previous preterm birth and preterm birth
in the index pregnancy thus a direct effect on the newborn
from COVID is likely
Overall our results were consistent across morbidities and
mostly at an RR near or greater than for maternal and neo
natal outcomes with narrow CIs excluding unity and above
to in several estimates Sensitivity and stratified analyses con
firmed the observed results They are probably conservative
because overall of women with COVID diagnosis were
asymptomatic a subgroup with a low risk of complications
Hence higher morbidity and mortality risk should be ex
pected for the general pregnant population especially in low
to middle income countries
We found of neonates born to test positive women
also tested positive a higher figure than in a recent system
atic review We speculate whether contamination at the time
of cesarean delivery was responsible because the rate in this
mother neonate positive subgroup was Reassuringly
as SARS CoV has not been isolated from breast milk breast
feeding was not associated with any increase in the rate oftest
positive neonates
Our results mostly reflect COVID diagnosed in the third
trimester Thus women with COVID diagnosis or whose
pregnancy ended earlier in pregnancy are underrepresented
either because our study was exclusively hospital based or ear
lier infection may manifest with mild symptoms which are
either ignored or managed in primary care Alternatively most
women might have avoided the hospital until late in preg
nancy or when in labor Clearly the effect of COVID early
in pregnancy needs urgently to be studied
Limitations
Our study has expected limitations Ideally we would have
collected data prospectively from all pregnancies in the par
ticipating institutions but this was impractical because of

Instruction
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
ADHD is a chronic condition that affects
millions of children and often continues into
adulthood ADHD includes a combination of
persistent problems such as difficulty
sustaining attention hyperactivity and
impulsive behavior It is characterized by
problems paying attention excessive activity
or difficulty controlling behavior which is not
appropriate for a person s age l These
symptoms begin by age six to twelve are
present for more than six months and cause
problems in at least two settings such as
school home or recreational activities In
children problems paying attention may
result in poor school performance
it causes impairment particularly in modern
society many children with ADHD have a
good attention span for tasks they find
interesting
ADHD is one of the most common
neurobehavioral disorders of childhood
About I in children years of age in
the United States have been diagnosed with
ADHD based on parent reports The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention CDC is
working to understand the risk factors for
ADHD including smoking during pregnancy
so that more can be done to prevent the
disorder
Authorized licensed use limited to Amrita School Of Engineering Kollam Downloaded on January at UTC from IEEE Xplore Restrictions apply
Prenatal maternal smoking has been
associated with ADHD in children in a
number of studies but whether the
association is causal is still under debate In
line with a number of observational studies
smoking during pregnancy is associated with
the diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder HKD
as well as with sub clinical symptoms of
inattention and hyperactivity However these
observational studies are vulnerable to genetic
confounding Many of the studies relied on
retrospective reports of smoking and many
studies had small sample sizes especially for
less common conditions such as TS and
schizophrenia There are also many other
risks that are often present along with
maternal smoking that might explain the link
with neurobehavioral disorders Thus more
research studies are necessary to determine
how prenatal exposure to smoking is related
to developmental outcomes in children
This study aimed to examine the association
between mother smoking during pregnancy
and ADHD in children using case control
study design in national data collected by
CDC
Method
NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey
was used in this study The NHANES
National Youth Fitness Survey NNYFS was

Strattera guanfacine Intuniv Each case

conditional logistic regression was conducted
among matched pairs to examine the impact
of mother smoking status during pregnancy
and ADHD
This study employed a case control study
design due the fact that ADHD could not be
commonly identified in this particular
database We only had about ADHD cases
A case control study is designed to help
determine if an exposure is associated with an
outcome i e disease or condition of
interest By definition a case control study
is always retrospective because it starts with
an outcome then traces back to investigate
exposures When the subjects are enrolled in
their respective groups the outcome of each
subject is already known by the investigator
Case control studies have specific advantages
compared to other study designs They are
particularly appropriate for studying rare
diseases or outcomes The practical value of
producing rapid results or investigating rare
outcomes may outweigh the limitations of
case control studies Because of their
efficiency they may also be ideal for
preliminary investigation of a suspected risk
factor for a common condition conclusions
may be used to justify a more costly and time
consuming longitudinal study later
Conditional logistic regression is an extension
of logistic regression that allows to take into
account stratification and matching Its main
field of application is observational studies
and in particular epidemiology Odds ratios

between exposure and outcome However it
is relative risk that people more intuitively
understand as a measure of association
Relative risk can be directly determined in a
cohort study by calculating a risk ratio RR
In case control studies and in cohort studies
in which the outcome occurs in less than
of the unexposed population the OR provides
a reasonable approximation of the RR
However when an outcome is common i Y
in the unexposed group the OR will
exaggerate the RR

In another study Women who smoked
during pregnancy had a higher risk of getting
child with a high hyperactivity inattention
score than women who did not smoke during
pregnancy and the magnitude of the
associations was similar across cohorts with
very different smoking habits
There are many risks from smoking before
and during pregnancy so it is especially
important that women do not smoke during
their reproductive years CDC has gathered
many resources that healthcare providers can
use to help women quit smoking before or
during pregnancy and uses a public health
approach to eliminate tobacco use and
exposure during the reproductive years
There are limitations of this study This is a
case control study and it has all the
limitations associated with this type of study

issue
In this case control study we confirmed
mother smoking during pregnancy was
significantly associated with ADHD in
children The magnitude of the associations
was similar with the findings in the literature
Additional efforts should be made to improve
the awareness of the increased risk of ADHD

Abstract According to Pakistan Medical and Dental Council
PMDC Pakistan is facing a shortage of approximately
medical doctors Due to the shortage of doctors a large number
of lives are in danger especially pregnant woman A large
number of pregnant women die every year due to pregnancy
complications and usually the reason behind their death is that
the complications are not timely handled In this paper we
proposed ontology based clinical decision support system that
diagnoses high risk pregnant women and refer them to the
qualified medical doctors for timely treatment The Ontology of
the proposed system is built automatically and enhanced
afterward using doctor s feedback The proposed framework has
been tested on a large number of test cases experimental results
are satisfactory and support the implementation of the solution

INTRODUCTION
The world has a shortage of professional medical doctors
even in the most developed countries have inadequate position
regarding the availability of medical doctors According to
Association of American Medical Colleges U S is facing a
shortage of approximately medical doctors In
Pakistan the situation is even much worse According to
Pakistan Medical and Dental Councils PMDC Pakistan is
facing a shortage of approximately medical doctors
Because of this shortage pregnant women are also affected
due to lack of proper and timely treatment which increased the
mortality rate of pregnant women over the years According to
world health organization WHO almost women die
every year from pregnancy related complications
Especially focusing on Maternal Mortality Rate it was
observed that most of the deaths occur because of few basic
complications Moreover these complications can be easily
treated once the reasons are diagnosed therefore the major
problem is the unavailability of proper diagnosis because of the
shortage of medical doctors

indicates Hypertension Obstructed Labor is an anomaly that
may arise during the process of labor Septicemia pollutes the
patient s blood and may occur due to infections caused by
bacteria and Hemorrhage occurs due to excessive loss of blood
from the patient s body
To overcome this problem we have proposed ontology
based clinical decision support system which can partially
work in place of doctors to diagnose high risk pregnant woman
and refer them to the qualified medical doctors for treatment
This way the high risk patients will get proper treatment well
in time and many lives can be saved The main focus of this
system is to build a diagnostic procedure which can work
independently of qualified doctors and identify high risk
patients Once these patients are identified they can be treated
by medical doctors So our system will help in reducing the
workload of doctors as well as providing basic health care to
more and more patients The framework is composed of three
components Automatic Ontology Construction
Feedback System and Ontology Enhancement Component
The rest of the paper is organized as follows In section
existing work in ontology based clinical decision support
system and automatic construction of ontology is discussed In
section the proposed approach is discussed Experimental
results are presented in section Finally the conclusion is
drawn in section
II LITERATURE REVIEW
A Ontology Based CDSS
There are many mistakes made on regular basis by humans
in clinical environments Hazmy Iman Abas et al in have
identified the three common mistakes made by clinicians that
are they failed to meet guidelines they are not educated on
regular basis and they are not aware of their responsibilities
According to the authors these mistakes can easily be avoided
by the use of ontology based clinical decision support system
The early detection of Alzheimer Disease is a challenging task
in medical domain Eider Sanchez et al in proposed an
ontological CDSS approach to detect Alzheimer in early
stages In this system multidisciplinary knowledge is used i e

the system uses three ontologies that are SWAN SNOMED
CT and MIND SWAN is used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer
Disease SNOMED CT s purpose is standardization and MIND
ontology is used to carry out patient tests Farahidayah Bt
Mahmud et al in designed a CDSS that finds the right time
of weaning a patient from ventilator According to the authors
the proposed Ontology based CDSS is very helpful because of
the ontology s ability of presenting complex concepts
reusability and specification of shared conceptualization
Similarly Adnan et al in proposed ontology based
clinical decision support system to assist electronic
discharge summary EDS while prescribing the patient s
medications Matt et al in developed an ontology based
CDSS for preoperative risk assessment The proposed system
takes the patient s data as input stores it in database and also
passes it to Ontology Modeler for conversion into OWL format
i e the same record is stored in two different formats
Afterwards inference is performed on both the database and
ontology Rule engine is used on the database to calculate the
numeric scores i e cardiac scores whereas classification
algorithm is run on the ontology to assign category to the
patient the results of both are then combined to calculate the
patient preoperative risk assessment
B Automatic Construction of Ontology
Abd Elrahman Elsayed et al in used data mining
technique decision tree on structured data to construct
ontology automatically In this approach the authors proposed
decision tree to ontology mapping where the tree decision
nodes are mapped to ontology classes and leaf nodes are
mapped to individuals The authors tested the proposed
approach on the soybean disease dataset and showed the
efficiency of the same Seongwook Youn et al in proposed
architecture for the classification of emails as spam or
legitimate using ontology based approach The authors created
a dataset D based on the features of the email i e spam email
and used WEKA decision tree to generate decision tree
which afterwards is passed to JENA for conversion into RDF
ontology format Authors divided the original dataset into two
parts i e training and testing dataset and tested the proposed
approach on testing dataset according to the authors the results
are satisfactory Amit Bhagat et al used association rule
mining to construct ontology from large transaction databases
In the proposed approach multiple level association rule
mining is used to extract more specific and relevant knowledge
as compared to single level rule mining Patrick Clerkin et al in
proposed automatic construction of ontology using the
COBWEB algorithm COBWEB is a clustering algorithm
which creates different clusters of the data in a hierarchical
manner In the proposed technique the hierarchy of the clusters
given by COBWEB is mapped into ontology classes in such a
way that parent cluster s is mapped as parent or super class es
in the ontology whereas the sub or child cluster s is mapped as
sub class es in the ontology Henrihs Gorskis et al in
reviewed the work done in the field of ontology building
using data mining techniques and the potential of different
techniques in the construction of ontology According to the
authors the ontologies created with data mining technique s
may be inferior to those constructed manually

Ill PROPOSED TECHNIQUE
In this paper we have proposed a framework for predicting
high risk woman using ontology based CDSS The framework
is composed of three main modules Automatic Ontology
Construction Feedback System Ontology Enhancing
Process
A Automatic Ontology Construction
This module automatically constructs the ontology of high
risk pregnant woman using pregnant woman dataset and is
composed of two sub components namely Rules extractor and
Rules to Ontology Mapper Rules extractor extracts the rules
from the pregnant woman dataset using WEKA and is
developed in Java WEKA API is used to call WEKA
functions from the program The dataset is given as input to
this component which uses WEKA API to extract rules from
the dataset The dataset is given in the ARFF Attribute
Relation File Format format which is compatible with WEKA
ARFF format has two sections the first section is Header
which contains the name of relation the attributes of the
relation and the attributes data types whereas the second
section has Data which contains the real instances of the
relations Example of partial IRIS dataset in ARFF format is
given below

Once the dataset is loaded attribute selection algorithm is
called using WEKA API We have used the genetic search for
attribute selection and once the most relevant features are
selected JRIP algorithm is called to extract rules which later
are used for the construction of ontology as summarized in
figure
Rules to Ontology Mapper is responsible to construct
ontology using the rules extracted in the first component as
shown in figure It first creates ontology classes for each
dataset i e hypertension Obstructed labor Hamorhage
Septicemia then the properties are created based on the
attributes found in the rules Furthermore the range and
domain of each property is set based on the information
provided by each dataset Afterwards for each class its
definition is created that reflects the classification criteria for
that class

B Feedback System
Once a patient is predicted as high risk by our proposed
system and recommended to the doctor for treatment feedback
is taken from the doctor whether the patient was correctly
identified or not If the doctor overrules the decision made by
the system the attributes which caused the decision are shown
to the doctor He can add delete the attribute s or tune their
parameters range i e change the values of an attribute to
more suitable one Afterwards the overruled instance with
tuned parameters or different attributes if any is added to
overruled dataset Once the number of instances in overruled
dataset reaches configurable this dataset is passed as input
to Ontology Enhancing Process for updating the ontology In
this way doctor s knowledge is incorporated in the system and
ontology is enhanced accordingly as shown in figure
C Ontology Enhancing Process
According to Gruber ontology represents knowledge
as a hierarchy of concepts and their relation for a specific
domain Furthermore ontology knowledge representation is
based on the concept of conceptualization which can be
defined as the objects the concepts and the relationship that
hold among them New concepts their properties and
relationship can easily be incorporated in ontology knowledge
base Therefore once the number of overruled instances
reaches p JRIP algorithm is executed on overruled dataset to
extract new knowledge and the same is updated in the
ontology either by creating new concepts or by defining new
relationship between the old concepts The complete
architecture of our proposed Ontology based Clinical Decision
Support System for predicting high risk pregnant woman is
shown in figure
lv EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A series of tests have been carried out in order to
demonstrate that the proposed system is working properly The
tests have been subdivided in two classes Automatic
construction of ontology and Ontology enhancement
Process Each of the experiment and its results are described in
following
A Automatic Construction of Ontology
This experiment is designed to verify the automatic
construction of ontology i e how well the rules are mapped
into ontology For this purpose the ontology and existing rule
base system are tested on the same datasets with the same
training and testing ratio In this experiment we used four
dataset for each output class i e Hypertension Obstructed
Labour Hamorhage Septicemia where each dataset is divided
into two parts i e and where of data is used
for training and is used for testing The experimentation
result showed that ontology and rule based system have same
accuracy which means the rules are transformed with
accuracy into the ontology as shown in figure
B Ontology enhancement Process
Enhancing the ontology is the most important aspect and
has been deeply validated In this activity fifteen doctors from
five different hospitals of Pakistan participated whenever the

patient is identified as high risk by our system the patient is
referred to one of the fifteen doctors If the doctor overruled the
decision feedback from the doctor is taken and the instance is
added to overrule dataset in this case the value is When
the instances in the overruled dataset reach p the new

knowledge is incorporated in the ontology We have observed
that after two rounds of ontology updation the accuracy of the

V CONCLUSION
According to world health organization WHO almost
women die every year from pregnancy related
complications Moreover these complications can be easily
treated once diagnosed however the major problem is

ABSTRACT
A qualified health workforce is essential to receiving effective timely affordable equitable and respectful family
planning and comprehensive abortion care However in many countries health workers lack the competencies
required to deliver quality family planning and comprehensive abortion care services Competency based edu
cation and learning aims to train and assess competencies The theory supported approach focuses on outcomes
emphasizes the learner s ability to perform promotes learner centeredness and links the health needs of the
Primary health care workforce
population to the competencies required of health workers In the World Health Organization published a
guidance document Sexual and reproductive health Core competencies in primary care defining the competencies
that primary care providers need to safely deliver sexual and reproductive health services at the community level
and included family planning and comprehensive abortion care
In this article we describe the methodology and process undertaken in by the World Health Organi
zation to produce the family planning and comprehensive abortion care competencies guidance filling gaps
identified in the previous guidance document The World Health Organization s Family Planning and Compre
hensive Abortion Care toolkit for the primary health care workforce was published in and defines the key
competencies for health workers in primary health care providing quality family planning and comprehensive
abortion care services as well as support for developing programmes and curricula for education and lifelong
learning The Toolkit is useful for practitioners managers supervisors and employers educators regulatory
bodies and policymakers It is an important advance toward strengthening family planning and comprehensive
abortion care services in primary health care
Background
Competent health workers are essential to effective timely afford
able equitable respectful and universal health care UHC How
ever all countries to varying degrees face challenges in the education
retention and performance of their health workforce
In recent
years within a context of increased health system complexity and
interdependency the competency based approach to education and
learning has been widely adopted for health professions at all levels
Competency based education CBE facilitates the alignment of ability
and performance within and across health systems globally CBE can be
adopted for instruction preparation and assessment In contrast to
traditional input based education approaches whereby learning is
achieved through exposure to certain health and medicine related
content or curriculum for a specific amount of time CBE focuses on
achieving the desired outcomes
The World Health Organization WHO defines competencies as
the abilities of a person to integrate knowledge skills and attitudes in
their performance of tasks in a given context Competencies are durable
trainable and through the expression of behaviors measurable
Competencies provide benchmarks not just for education but also for
performance in the workplace They help to define standards of

performance but also to plan and measure professional development
improving job performance as well as learning
CBE strategy aims to
develop a person s abilities and concentrates on the goals and outcomes
of learning rather than prescribing a particular learning path with a set
of pre defined milestones
In CBE systems learning is based on the
acquisition of competency based learning outcomes that are objective
standardized and can be observed in practice and transferred and
translated across contexts
This approach to health care edu
cation has been implemented and adopted into policy internationally
Regulatory bodies have a fundamental commitment to sup
porting professional competence and therefore play a critical role in
promoting the implementation of CBE for health care
The knowledge skills attitudes and behaviors of health care pro
fessionals influence the quality and outcomes of services delivered
including in family planning FP and comprehensive abortion care
For example there is a significant relationship between
CAC
the uptake and continuation of FP and the skill of health professionals
offering counselling and services
Further estimates from
suggest that just under half of all abortions that occurred globally from
to were unsafe indicating that services were either carried
out by a trained provider using outdated methods a safe method was
used without appropriate support from a trained provider or the service
was provided by an untrained person using dangerous invasive methods
Despite this the inclusion of FP and CAC within Sexual and Repro
ductive Health SRH core competencies or curricula for education and
training is inconsistent across professional bodies creating a gap in the
competencies and standard of care necessary to meet the SRH needs of
populations
In WHO published a guidance document
Sexual and Reproductive Health Core Competencies in Primary Health
Care defining the competencies including knowledge skills attitudes
and behaviors that primary care providers need to safely deliver SRH
services at the community level including FP and CAC However in
during efforts to update the document it emerged that it con
tained gaps and had not been widely adopted
To set the standard of performance for FP and CAC service providers
and as part of a unique collaboration across UNDP UNFPA UNICEF
WHO World Bank Special Programme of Research Development and
Research Training in Human Reproduction HRP and the Department of
Health Workforce a competency development team was organized to
prepare the Family Planning and Comprehensive Abortion Care Toolkit for
the primary health care workforce
The Toolkit as of today consists of two volumes the FP and CAC
competencies are in Volume and Volume provides guidance on how
to develop competency based education programs and curricula
The FP and CAC competencies Volume are designed to
accommodate a range of health care workers contexts service delivery
mechanisms and evolving competency requirements The FP and CAC
Toolkit was intended as a foundational tool that can be adapted by ed
ucators and regulators for current and future health practice and focus
on the core functions of primary health care providers toward universal
health care whoever is providing them In this article we describe the
methodology and process undertaken by the competency development
team to develop the FP and CAC competencies published in Volume of
the Toolkit to both advocate for the use of these core competencies in
health care education learning and continuing professional develop
ment and to encourage the development of competencies for other areas
of practice
Development and validation of FP and CAC core competencies
There is not one universally accepted model or guidance for the
development of core competencies for health care professions
or
ganizations have used a range of processes and methods WHO under
took the development of the FP and CAC competencies in a series of
phases The first phase consisted of a review of key literature the second
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
phase involved focus group discussions FGDs the third phase devel
oped the competencies the draft competencies were refined and vali
dated in phase four an on line global DELPHI consultation
to
achieve consensus and the final phase was a virtual Town Hall style
meeting to confirm the competencies and gauge their global acceptance
The phases brought together different sources of data to develop and
validate the competencies We discuss each phase in turn below
Phase Literature review
The competency development team conducted a review of existing
literature on SRH competencies to inform the structure and content of
the FP and CAC competencies
The specific objectives of the liter
ature review were to collect evidence from published and unpub
lished documents to identify how the WHO SRH competencies
framework had been used examine what aspects of the document has
been useful and which ones had not and identify any additional
domains and competencies to be included in the FP and CAC
competencies
The competency development team used the following terms to
locate published and unpublished literature for review competencies
competency frameworks competency based education SRH ser
vices family planning and comprehensive abortion care They
used these terms to search websites of international health organizations
and professional associations for relevant documents The team
analyzed and reviewed documents to determine whether they had value
based on the objectives of the review and credibility as sources using
specifically designed templates until they achieved saturation
In total the team purposively selected and reviewed documents
including articles and reports published from until October
The findings of the literature review were summarized into tables

tional competencies that could be added to the revised framework
Overall the findings of the literature review suggested that the FP
and CAC competencies would benefit from an increased focus on ado
lescents and population groups in vulnerable settings the addition of
post abortion care and postpartum family planning among others
improved flexibility or associated strategies tools in adapting the
competencies to various contexts e g humanitarian settings and
occupational groups e g due to health workforce optimization and
include advice on how to implement at the country level The review
also indicated that the FP and CAC competencies should place greater
emphasis on addressing provider bias values clarification managing
care in restrictive environments religion laws community norms and
the use of data for decision making The review findings further sug
gested that structurally the FP and CAC competencies should avoid
overlap between the competencies and domains provide additional
detail be more user friendly
and take a lifespan approach Finally
according to the review the updated document should list essential
competencies and encourage countries to add their own content and
competencies These results informed the content and structure of the FP
and CAC domains and competencies included in the Toolkit Volume
Phase First tier corroboration Focus group discussions

The team conducted FGDs to explore stakeholder perceptions and
use of the WHO Sexual and reproductive health Core competencies in
primary care document and understand stakeholder needs for FP and
CAC competencies The FGDs were designed to complement and address
any gaps in information identified by the literature review The team
invited faculty policymakers practitioners trainers and members of
relevant professional organizations to participate in two virtual FGDs in
November Of these individuals thirteen attended the first FGD
and participated in the second The FGDs aimed to explore What
are the current challenges in the delivery of FP and CAC services
Were you aware of the WHO Sexual and reproductive health Core
competencies inprimary care and What recommendations do you have
for the FP and CAC competencies
The analysis of the FGDs took a phenomenological study approach
The team identified and categorized themes within and across
interview data to describe the phenomena of interest The team
discovered that most of the participants were familiar with the
WHO SRH framework Of these some mentioned that the WHO
SRH framework had not influenced practice and needed to be updated in
line with recent evidence from WHO guidelines for FP and CAC Others
described the framework as lacking contextualization and including
excessive information that was not easy to interpret thereby limiting its
practical use Participants explained that the framework lacked infor
mation on health workforce optimization tools for actual implementa
tion and monitoring and details on how to perform procedures
Furthermore they argued that it was also missing the social component
Challenging issues such as working with minors maintaining confi
dentiality operating within restrictive laws providing services during
pandemics and in humanitarian settings required further elaboration
Guidance on training faculty members and addressing care in terms of
human rights also needed additional explanation
FGD participants described several obstacles to the delivery of FP
and CAC including misconceptions and stigma among providers reli
gious and legal restrictions affecting service provision provider bias the
relationship between adequate theoretical knowledge and effective
practice or competency and the lack of access to services among people
in vulnerable settings Participants identified issues with formal edu
cation program such as inconsistency between pre service training and
service provision inadequately prepared faculty members providing
poor quality education lack of procedural and national guideline
training missing and or outdated equipment at facilities and poorly
selected clinical learning sites Management issues included having an
inadequate number of trained staff managers lacking authority to share
U R Loi et al
tasks between different occupations and inadequate supervision Par
ticipants also felt there was lack of coordination between government
and other organizations the private sector and development partners
The participants made recommendations for the new FP and CAC
competencies For example they suggested that FP and CAC compe
tencies should include content on the development of communication
skills recording interpreting and practical use of data inclusion of
post pregnancy FP and CAC in pre service education programs self care
and health promotion and increased time for hands on skill acquisition
The participants felt that faculty members needed to be updated on SRH
service provision They added that professional development and on
the job trainings are important mechanisms to be included to maintain
the competence of faculty Other recommendations included the use of
competencies in actual practice to simplify and make it more user
friendly guidance on how to use the competencies in different contexts
the provision of incentives and other opportunities to encourage use of
the competencies Finally there was a request for a dissemination and
implementation strategy to be articulated at national level with all
stakeholders engaged in the process
Phase Constructing the competency document
The results of the literature review and the FDGs formed the basis of
the initial draft of the FP and CAC competencies The team additionally
ensured that the competencies were aligned with the new WHO Abor
tion Care guideline
They retained Domain A from the SRH
Competency Framework which listed necessary attitudes and
values for providing high quality SRH care
For the

the technical competencies These domains included client
centeredness decision making
collaboration
communication
evidence informed practice and personal conduct Each competency
specifies the knowledge and the behaviors required Fig Finally the
draft FP and CAC competencies included three practice domains H to
J respectively shared FP and CAC competencies FP competencies and
CAC competencies The practice competencies are specific but not
exclusive to FP and CAC and distinguish FP and CAC practitioners from
other health care workers The competencies were designed to be suit
able for defining learning outcomes or learning objectives both for
formal education and for non formal and informal learning
Phase Second tier corroboration Delphi Consultation
The Delphi Consultation process was conducted from September to
November to achieve consensus on the content of the draft FP and
The competency development team con
CAC competencies
ducted two rounds of virtual Delphi consultations to gather feedback
gauge agreement with the content of the draft FP and CAC competencies
and receive suggestions for improvement and additional content They
recruited potential participants by sharing an invitation to FP and CAC
practitioners and educators globally A wide variety of relevant orga
nizations also nominated potential participants and an invitation was
also distributed through the Implementing Best Practice IBP Network
members
Potential participants were invited to nominate other
experts and practitioners in a snowball recruitment process using
Survey Monkey The invitation included a short video explaining how
important and valuable their expertise would be to the process to
encourage them to join the consultation

They provided a point Likert
scale strongly agree agree neither agree nor disagree disagree
strongly disagree to indicate panelists level of agreement with com
petency statements The competencies were available in English French
and Spanish The team used the software platform Welphi https
www welphi com en which permitted respondents to complete the
questions anonymously at their own pace and provided spaces for
additional comments The team took note of feedback during the
consultation and the areas of disagreement and later modified the FP
and CAC competencies accordingly They then explored the nature and
characteristics of panelists with divergent views to identify whether
these represented a particular aspect of global diversity that had not
been adequately reflected and to rectify any gaps errors or areas that
could be better presented
As part of our analysis of the first round of the Delphi consultation
the team assessed the characteristics of the expert panelists to ensure
that they were globally representative They then analyzed the feedback
and made improvements to the competencies such as simplifying
clarifying and removing duplications Two members of the competency
development team reviewed the opinions of expert panelists who rated
the competencies the lowest to identify inconsistent negative responses
and to explore whether there were any groups sharing socio
demographic characteristics such as geography context occupation
who disagreed with the competencies No specific patterns emerged All
the comments associated with a particular competency were considered
and discussed with two team members until they agreed upon the
necessary changes Where necessary the team revised the competency
and the new version was consulted again with the panelists in Round
of the Delphi study Twelve competencies were rephrased as a result and
sent for further feedback Only panelists who had participated in Round
were invited to participate in Round to ensure continuity and
comparability of responses and so that responses were based on the
detailed understanding of the competencies In total panelists
completed Round and a further partially completed Round
According to Delphi methodology a consensus among partic
ipants is considered acceptable and in accordance with Delphi study
methodology
In the first round the Delphi achieved higher
consensus at greater than on each of the competencies Within the
Delphi methodology amendment can end once a high level of consensus
has been achieved Nevertheless the feedback had led to some suggested
changes and the team advanced these to the second round The
consensus rate in the second round was higher than in the first ranging
from to Therefore the original plan for a third round was
deemed unnecessary
Phase Third tier corroboration Town Hall meeting
Validation of the FP and CAC competencies took place in a hour
virtual Town Hall meeting on December The meeting was
chaired by HRP and included registered participants including FP
and CAC practitioners national and international FP and CAC interest
groups teachers and lecturers technical advisors officers and project
managers pharmacists and researchers The meeting was co hosted by
the WHO Prevention of Unsafe Abortion Unit and the WHO Contra
ception and Fertility Care Unit
Prior to the Town Hall meeting the competency development team
provided relevant documents to participants in English French and
Spanish versions of the competencies document were available upon
request Following the presentation of the draft competencies partici
pants discussed and submitted comments and questions through the
online chat facility A full set of questions with responses and proposed
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
changes to the competencies were collated after the virtual meeting and
shared with participants
Fig
The final version of the FP and CAC competencies resulting from the
collaborative and consultative process included FP and CAC com
petencies which are organized into ten domains The ten domains fall
into three competency groups attitudes professional compe
tencies and practice competencies
These compe
Fig
tencies can be used in conjunction with WHO guidelines that contain
recommendations on FP and CAC service delivery
They also
include a flexible menu for ease of use This menu also facilitates
contextualized adjustments to the local policy regulatory and health
systems contexts
Based on feedback during the Town Hall meeting the competencies
include reference to human rights standards in international law the
applicability of which in a specific setting will depend on factors such as
the State s ratification of relevant human rights instruments
Discussion
The Toolkit was developed with the ambition to strengthen FP and
CAC education and training with competency based performance
assessment The collaborative and consultative methodology under
taken to develop the FP and CAC competencies resulted in evidence
based competencies that allow for standardization and adaptability
across contexts By articulating critical competencies for FP and CAC
this Toolkit sets a global benchmark that encourages and supports health
workers and decision makers around the world to strive towards
harmonized high standards of services These competencies which are
based on recent evidence and guidelines including the WHO
Abortion Care guideline
will help set standards for education
training and performance
Attitudes or feelings values and beliefs are foundational to all
other competencies and influence their behavior and the performance
of all tasks undertaken in the health care context Stigmatizing attitudes
among health workers and others involved in the delivery of FP and CAC
hinders access to quality care and is a fundamental cause of health in
equalities
The FP and CAC competencies provide a shared
language about attitudes knowledge and skills needed in service de
livery The inclusion of attitudes as a fundamental competency for FP
and CAC is progress towards the reduction of stigma and normalization
of these services
In the development of the FP and CAC competencies the competency
development team adhered to a stepwise consultative process previ
ously used by many professional organizations to assure maximum
input from diverse sources professional areas of practice countries and
regions socio economic and cultural contexts The process undertaken
was rigorous and demonstrated strong consensus among a wide range of
stakeholders However there were some limitations to this process
Although the competency development team made efforts to be inclu
sive they may have overlooked key stakeholders and experts In the
consultative process the team provided the draft competencies in three
languages and encouraged comments in the language participants felt
most comfortable using As a result the team received comments in
French Spanish and Greek Nevertheless most of the consultation ac
tivities were in English This may have biased participation away from
non English speaking groups
The process we undertook to create and validate the FP and CAC
competencies was effective and offers a further model for the develop
ment of CBE tools We encourage the formation of non formal trans
national networks such as the one created for the development of these
FP and CAC competencies to share experiences tools applications and
feedback toward the uptake and continued improvement of the com
petencies and the Toolkit
Accelerating awareness uptake and use of the FP and CAC compe
tencies is of prime importance to improve performance of the primary
health workforce Most stakeholders are aware of the value of using

What were the consultation procedures leading to the development of the Competencies
document
A request for more information on micro credentials and informal elements of learning the
model
Questions and suggestions on how to disseminate and make the competencies work for any context
How to make discussion about FP and CAC provision safe on social media especially when those
communicators remove content from their platforms
How can we strengthen national ownership and accountability for implementation Because the
document is a guide so WHO Member States are not obliged to adopt them There is urgency to
implement so I have a suggestion for a resolution signed and adopted by regions and countries
How to use the competencies in those countries which have restrictive laws on abortion or forbid it
completely
Suggestion to use digital platforms to support dissemination which can be very effective channels
for the dissemination and implementation and involvement of Professional Associations in country
The need for advocacy to engage in promotion of those documents and also to lobby the social
media platforms not to block vital and research based information
What is your opinion of simulation within training
How to tackle illegal and dangerous informal provision of CAC services
Discussion on use of the phrase the fullest extent of the law in respect of clarity but also restrictive
nature of that phrase that doesn t take into account the international human rights standards that
the state is legally obligated to implement and health professional needs to take into account
sometimes forgetting their own private beliefs
Comments on accessibility of such extensive documents and the need to design them so they are
accessible for people with different abilities and using other languages
Comments on specific elements of the competency document
Fig Key questions raised in the Town Hall
competencies to improve education learning and practice in the health
sector
The FP and CAC competencies provide a menu of options from
which organizations institutions and service providers can choose the
set of individual competencies they require to focus on They may
identify a tailored set of competencies aligned with national or local
level health requirements and capacity gaps in the workforce Specific
language of the FP and CAC competencies can be adapted to local
contexts
Conclusion
Healthcare technology and systems are in constant flux and are
advancing rapidly Continued validation of professional competencies
and standards is essential to accommodate this ever changing environ
ment A single method for competency development and validation is
unlikely to satisfy the needs of all situations However the effective
processes and methods used here may provide guidance for others
interested in developing competencies and standards in SRH and
elsewhere

The impact of prenatal care on birth out
comes has been an area of subqantialSontro
versy in the public health qeld I A number of
indexes notably s Adequacy of
Prenatal Care Utilization APNCU
have been developed to study this issue
Less attention however has been directed to
evaluating the type of data used to calculate
measures of the use of prenatal care
Although vital statistics data are often
used as a sc rce of information on prenatal
care birth certificate records reflect the
Q ber s recollection of her prenatal care his
tory and her understanding of what consti
tutes a prenatal care visit Administrative data
provide an alternative source of such infor
mation These data offer the advantages of
eliminating patient recall as a potential
source of error and permitting specification
of the types of providers who deliver prenatal
care Care from diverse types of primary and
specialty providers during pregnancy may
have distinct benefits for women with chroTfi
diseases such as HIV infection who ave
increased risk of adverse birth outco es
In this retrospective cohort stu y we

Methods
Data
We studied Medicaid recipients in
New York State who delivered live born sin
gleton children between and who
were identified by a tested case finding
screen as HIV infected and who had claims
data linked to vital statistics records of
mothers For mothers with multiple deliver
ies in the study period one delivery was ran
domly selected The study population also
reflects the prior exclusion of mothers
who participated in programs that paid a
global fee for prenatal care since we could
not determine the number or type of their
visits
Birth outcomes served as the criteria for
our analyses Low birthweight was specified
as less than g and preterm birth was
defined as a gestational age of less than
weeks based on the physician s esti
mate or when the physician s estimate was
unavailable of cases the mother s esti
mate of her last menses
The APNCU index was calculated in
ways First we used data on prenatal care

the analysis inadequate prenatal care was
compared with all other levels i e ade

To control for possible confounders we
included several other maternal characteris
tics in our multivariate analyses Lacking
viral load and T lymphocyte data we
evaluated maternal HIV stage from diag
noses previously reported to be predictive of
maternal child HIV transmissio including
history of clinical DS pne monia or
anemia during pregnancy medical
conditions including hypertension asthma
and diabetes were also determined from
diagnoses on claims Illicit drug use was
measured by an approach that in previous
validation studies of claims data identified
of with illicit drug use noted
on charts Other demographic and behav
ioral covariates included age race ethnicity
marital status nativity US including Puerto
Rican vs foreign New York City resi
dence parity year of delivery educational
attainment and smoking and alcohol use
during pregnancy
Analysis
Simple K computed
to assess the chance corrected agreement
among the different measures of adequate
prenatal care These are interpreted in the
same way as intraclass correlation coeffi
cients To evaluate the relative strength of the
association between the variously specified
APNCU indexes and birth outcomes we
compared logistic regression models for
each outcome Each model included the
same covariates with I of the APNCU
indexes there were no significant interaction
terms and the adjusted odds ratio and
confidence interval were contrasted
Results
In of the deliveries the infants
were low birthweight a similar proportion
were preterm The proportion of mothers
with adequate prenatal care utilization var
ied from one half for the APNCU index
derived from vital statistics to two thirds for
the index based on visits to the most com
prehensive set of providers Table As
shown by the K statistic we observed poor
agreement between each of the claims
based APNCU indexes of prenatal care and
the birth certificate based APNCU index
Agreement among the claims based mea
sures was considerably better
The adjusted odds ratios for the types
of data source did not differ dramatically for
either birth outcome Table However the
APNCU measure based on visits to the most
comprehensive set of providers primary
care obstetrics gynecology and HIV special
ists consistently showed the strongest asso
ciation with a to reduction in the
adjusted odds of either birth outcome The
other indexes showed to reduc
tions in the odds of low birthweight How

Discussion
The assessment of adequacy of prenatal
care utilization based on birth certificate data
showed little agreement with that based on
claims Previous studies of the concordance
of prenatal care information fro
er
tificates and from other dat sources ve
shown simi lar poor agreem nt our
study measures we foun
t the most
comprehensive claims based APNCU index
had the strongest association with both low
birthweight and preterm birth
The APNCU measure developed by
Kotelchuck was not intended to take into
account care by providers other than those
directly involved
ell ering obstetric and
gynecologic ser es n considering visits
to other providers such as internists and HIV
specialists in a measure of adequacy of pre
natal care we may have classified some
women as having adequate prenatal care
when they actually had fewer obstetric visits
than recommended However we hypothe
size that visits to these other providers facili
tated detection and treatment of conditions
that could have had an adverse effect on birth
outcomes e g serious infections hyperten
sion severe anemia asthma or poor nutri
tion We cannot say whether a study of
healthy women or women with diseases other
than HIV infection would show a similar
advantage to considering care during preg
nancy delivered by providers other than
obstetricians
American Journal of Public Health
Our findings should prompt researchers
to consider the value of administrative data
in the examination of prenatal care adequacy
They should also lead researchers to recon
sider the Wpes of visits that should be included
in an evaluation of prenatal care utilization
or more accurately an evaluation of care
during pregnancy For women with chronic
diseases treatment from a broader set of
providers may contribute to improved birth
outcomes Z

Past studies of maternal home visitation
programs have feported attr tion rates rang
ing from to Although the primary
goal of most honie visitation studies is to
measure programmatic effects on infant mor
bidity and mortality investigators often face
difficulties estimating program benefits
when a substantial proportion of women drop
out earlier than expected
To date relatively few studies have
focused on examining the characteristics of
women who diol of prevention programs
prematurely of these studies have
focused on pregnant women at risk for poor
psychosocial functioning and none are spe
cific to maternal home visitation programs
Given the dearth of information concerning
the characteristics of program dropouts and
completers and the applicability of this
knowledge to program planning the present
study examined associations between
women s sociodemographic characteristics
perceived needs psychological functioning
substance use and informal social support
networks and their duration of participation
in a North Carolina matemal home visitation

INTRODUCTION
Malaria remains a persistent and life threatening
disease annually affecting millions and
significantly impacting mortality rates particularly
among children under five and pregnant women
contributing to nearly of recorded deaths in
hospitals and health centers The global
significance of malaria persists notably in
endemic countries such as Nigeria where
million people are at risk Caused by five
Plasmodium species
with
Plasmodium
falciparum being the most lethal malaria
continues to pose a significant public health
challenge prevalent in numerous African
countries Recent findings underscore Nigeria
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo s
substantial contribution accounting for over
of the estimated total deaths due to malaria
Globally malaria remains a devastating
international health concern with nearly
million new infections and million deaths
reported annually The impact is particularly
severe among children under five and pregnant
women in sub Saharan Africa where almost
of the annual mortality in this population is
attributed to malaria
Pregnant women residing in malaria endemic
regions pose a significant concern due to their
reduced immunity during pregnancy Moreover
in areas characterized by stable malaria
transmission a substantial number of malaria
cases during pregnancy exhibit no symptoms
The absence of symptoms in pregnant women is
attributed to acquired immunity from previous
exposures to malarial infections
Regrettably malaria poses a dual threat to both
the expectant mother and the developing fetus
Various regions in Nigeria have reported
divergent prevalence rates of malaria in
pregnancy ranging from to
Malaria can lead to adverse maternal outcomes
such as anemia hypoglycemia and in severe
cases maternal death Sub Saharan Africa alone
witnesses an estimated maternal deaths
annually due to malaria related anemia
Furthermore malaria significantly contributes to
low birth weight in infants due to compromised
nutrient delivery to the placenta
Malaria holds the top position among the seven
diseases initially targeted for global control or
eradication by the World Health Organization s
Tropical Disease Research TDR This
prioritization is due to the disease s significant
morbidity mortality rates diagnostic challenges
the absence of ideal drugs and effective
vaccines and other behaviors exhibited by its
vector
The impact of malaria extends beyond individual
health adversely affecting the physical mental
and social well being of communities along with
impeding the economic development of nations
Studies reveal that households spend up to one
thousand one hundred and twelve naira monthly
on malaria treatment presenting a considerable
financial burden particularly given the economic
status of the population
Despite efforts such as the Roll Back Malaria
program some reports suggest that government
led malaria control initiatives may face
challenges While certain African countries
experienced a reduction in malaria
incidence and deaths between and
due to high intervention coverage and effective
surveillance WHO World Malaria Report
Nigeria especially concerning malaria in
pregnancy has not shown similar progress The
minimal impact in Nigeria is attributed to
resource constraints Roll Back Malaria
Malaria is a formidable global public health
challenge particularly in African countries where
of the world s population resides in endemic
regions Approximately million pregnancies
Oladeji et al Asian J Preg Childb vol no pp Article no AJPCB
occur annually in malaria endemic areas of sub
Saharan Africa with notably high prevalence
among pregnant women and children under five
In Nigeria of pregnant women were
diagnosed with malaria according to the Federal
Ministry of Health in underscoring the
severity of the issue
In the southwestern region of Nigeria previous
studies have documented malaria parasite
prevalence rates ranging from to
among pregnant women Malaria during
pregnancy has been identified as a significant
contributor to maternal mortality causing up to
deaths annually Additionally it leads to
elevated
rates of maternal morbidity
characterized by symptoms such as fever and
severe anemia particularly affecting first time
mothers The impact extends to adverse
outcomes such as low birth weight and placental
parasitemia with an estimated to
infant deaths attributed to malaria infection
during pregnancy each year The detrimental
effects of malaria are most pronounced in the
first and second pregnancies of women residing
in areas of relatively stable transmission The
temporary depression of immunity facilitating the
development of the allograft fetus is cited as
one of the reasons for the heightened
susceptibility of pregnant women to malaria
In response to this public health challenge
Heads of Government and International
Agencies at the African Summit on Roll Back
Malaria RBM in Abuja in the year
declared a commitment to reducing the malaria
burden by at least by A widely
accepted measure in this endeavor involves the
utilization of Insecticide Treated Nets ITNs
in
especially
malaria endemic
regions
Consequently there has been the free
distribution of ITNs donated by the Roll Back
Malaria initiative targeting children under five
and pregnant women Despite decades of
research malaria in pregnancy MiP remains a
significant public health challenge that has
proven challenging to address Numerous
studies from regions with diverse malaria
transmission patterns have explored the impact
of MiP on both maternal health and birth
outcomes While the predominant consequence
of MiP on maternal health is often characterized
by anemia there is a scarcity of data concerning
malaria related maternal mortality Regarding the
fetus the most frequently observed adverse
effect of MiP is an elevated risk of low birth
weight LBW a critical factor associated with
impaired development and increased infant
mortality However many of these studies rely on
single measurement points typically from cross
sectional surveys or during delivery failing to
capture the multifaceted factors that influence
MiP over an extended period
Accurately assessing MiP is crucial for
understanding its effects on birth outcomes and
infant health but it poses challenges due to the
involvement of various factors that are
sometimes difficult to fully capture The
continuity or intermittency of MiP depends on
factors such as a woman s exposure to vectors
her level of immunity potential co infections
e g other malaria species HIV or helminths
and the efficacy of available treatment and
prevention
interventions
Achieving
of MiP
comprehensive
understanding
necessitates considering these diverse factors
that play a role over an extended timeframe

Study Population
The target population
for
this
study
encompassed women of childbearing age who
have had or are currently experiencing
Local
pregnancy within
the
specified
Government The study focused on women
actively seeking healthcare services during both
ante and post natal periods at hospitals or
clinics
Ethical clearance was diligently obtained from
the relevant authority of
the hospital
Subsequently informed consent was secured
from all participants selected through random
sampling for the study Prior to obtaining
consent the purpose of the research was
thoroughly explained to each participant It was
emphasized that participation was entirely
voluntary and individuals had the right to decline
or withdraw from the study at any stage even
after providing initial consent Importantly
patients who opted not to participate were
assured that their decision would not affect their
access to routine care available at the facility
The study included a cohort of pregnant
women regularly attending the antenatal clinic at
the hospital The age range of the participants
spanned from to years Exclusions from
the study comprised women currently on any
form of malaria chemoprophylaxis those testing
positive for human immunodeficiency virus HIV
and individuals with sickle cell disease These
exclusions were made to ensure a more focused
and homogenous study population
Design
and Adminstration of
Questionnaire
Two hundred self administered semi
structured questionnaires were meticulously
designed and then distributed to pregnant
women to assess the impact of malaria The
questionnaires sought information on various
including
socio demographic
aspects
characteristics the distribution pattern and
prevalence of malaria fever among pregnant
women Additionally the survey delved into
environmental factors contributing to the spread
of malaria the socio economic status of the
mothers and the public health management of
malaria This comprehensive approach in
questionnaire development aimed to capture a
broad spectrum of data enabling a thorough
analysis of the multifaceted factors related to
malaria among pregnant women
Data Collection
and Sampling
Techniques
Primary data
To bolster the reliability of the research and
achieve its objectives the study employed pre
coded and semi structured questionnaires
These instruments were administered to a
sample of pregnant women attending
antenatal care The collected information
encompassed various domains including socio
demographic characteristics the distribution
pattern and prevalence of malaria fever among
pregnant women Additionally the questionnaires
delved into environmental factors contributing to
the spread of malaria the socio economic status
of the mothers and the public health
management of malaria The use of structured
questionnaires ensured a systematic and
standardized approach to data collection
facilitating a comprehensive analysis of factors
related to malaria among pregnant women
Secondary data
In addition to the questionnaire based data
collection information was gathered by visiting
multiple Health Centers in the study area This
involved procuring records of malaria distribution
in pregnant women over the past four years
By including this retrospective data
the study aimed to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the trends and
patterns of malaria prevalence among pregnant
women in the specified timeframe This dual
approach combining current survey data with
historical health center records contributes to a
more nuanced analysis and interpretation of the
factors influencing malaria distribution in the
study area
Sample Selection
The sample selection for this research was
conducted through a random process among
pregnant women registered for antenatal care at
the selected hospitals Specifically every third
woman attending the antenatal clinic occurring
every other day was chosen to participate in the
study Selected individuals were provided with
detailed information about the research including
its purpose and their consent for participation
was obtained before any sample collection took
place This approach to sample selection
ensures a degree of randomness and
representation among the pregnant women

Across various healthcare facilities in Ikire
admission records for pregnant women from
to reveal distinctive patterns At the
General Hospital Ikire there has been fluctuation
in admission rates ranging from a peak of
to a low of Notably this suggests a
relatively low overall rate of hospitalization
among the registered pregnant women during
this period A similar trend is observed at Omoda
Health Centre Ikire where admissions were
notably low reaching non admission for all
registered pregnant women in Although
there is a slight increase in admissions in
infrequent
the overall pattern
indicates
hospitalizations Emmanuel Hospital Ikire also
reflects a relatively low admission rate with the
highest recorded rate being in In
contrast Boluwatife Convalescent Home Ikire
categorized as a primary health center with
limited facilities primarily treated pregnant
women as outpatients resulting in recorded
admissions of NIL This collective data across
healthcare facilities suggests a noteworthy
observation a substantial number of pregnant
women may not have undergone malaria
parasite tests unless prompted by specific
complaints indicating a potential gap in
systematic testing practices This highlights the
need for a more comprehensive and proactive
approach to screening pregnant women for
malaria parasites ensuring early detection and
appropriate management for the well being of
both the mothers and their unborn children
The findings from the conducted study reveal a
concerning prevalence of malaria among
pregnant women in the study area A substantial
of the tested pregnant women were positive
for malaria parasites indicating a high burden of
the disease within the community Further
analysis of the results shows that of the
cases exhibited a high level of malaria parasites
suggesting a significant proportion of individuals
with a more severe and potentially complicated
infection Additionally displayed scanty
malaria parasites which may point to early or
mild stage infections
In contrast of the tested pregnant women
showed no detectable malaria parasites while
had no parasites of any kind While this is a
positive aspect it highlights the need for a
nuanced understanding of the varying degrees of
infection within the population
The overall prevalence rates underscore the
urgent need for targeted interventions to address
the high incidence of malaria among pregnant
women in the area Implementing robust and
timely interventions such as widespread testing
preventive measures and appropriate treatment

results serve as a critical call to action for public
health authorities and healthcare providers to
prioritize and implement effective strategies to
combat malaria in the local pregnant population
The outcomes of the study conducted on non
pregnant women in the area reveal a noteworthy
prevalence of malaria within this demographic
Among the non pregnant women tested a

These findings bring to light the importance of
implementing effective control measures for
malaria in the general non pregnant population
The prevalence among non pregnant women
signals the need for comprehensive strategies
including widespread testing
preventive
interventions and appropriate treatment to curb
the impact of malaria on the overall health of the

about malaria its transmission and had
experienced a malaria attack aligning with
similar studies globally The timing of
recent malaria attacks with reporting
incidents within the past week emphasizes the
urgency for timely intervention strategies and
continuous monitoring consistent with findings in
a neighboring state
Moreover
the majority of
respondents
recognized the potential fatality of untreated
malaria and common symptoms
consistent with studies in different
countries illustrating a global understanding of
the severe consequences of untreated malaria
during pregnancy

contributing to the spread of malaria Similar
studies in malaria endemic regions have
highlighted the significance of environmental
factors in malaria transmission The
acknowledgment of poor sanitation and
overgrown weeds aligns with a study in
a different Nigerian locality suggesting that
interventions addressing environmental factors
could be universally applied in various regions
Table Socio economic Status of
Mothers Regarding Malaria Epidemics
Table explores the socio economic aspects
influencing malaria epidemics among pregnant
women The belief that one s occupation
determines the density of malaria
echoes findings from a study in a neighboring
state However the majority disputing the
impact of income on the effect of malaria fever
on pregnancy contrasts with a study in a
different African region emphasizing the need for
context specific
interventions
The
recognition of the role of education in the spread
of malaria fever suggests a potential
knowledge gap that requires targeted health
education campaigns resonating with a study in
a similar context
Table Public Health Management of
Malaria
Table delves into treatment seeking behavior
and practices related to malaria management
The diverse range of health seeking practices
including visits to quack traditional men or
prophets reflects a complex health
landscape that requires culturally sensitive
interventions The preference for specific
antimalarial drugs such as Sulphadoxine or
pyrimethamine fansidar by
of
respondents is consistent with regional drug
preferences documented in a study in a
neighboring state However the varying

behaviors among pregnant women in malaria
endemic regions However nuanced
differences highlight the need for tailored
interventions considering local contexts and
perceptions
CONCLUSION
Malaria remains a significant public health
challenge in Africa affecting approximately
countries including Nigeria where about
million people are at risk Pregnant women and
their unborn babies are particularly vulnerable to
malaria infection posing a threat to life in
communities The study focused on Irewole
Local Government
revealing the typical
characteristics of a malaria endemic area
Despite the challenges the study emphasizes
that concerted efforts community awareness
and effective strategies can bring about positive
change
The research uncovered overlooked intricacies
that if addressed could contribute to reducing
the scourge of the disease It shed light on the
strengths and weaknesses of both governmental
and non governmental approaches to public
health problems Governments are urged to
move beyond lip service and take substantive
actions to address issues affecting citizens
RECOMMENDATIONS
To address the prevalent challenges of malaria in
the study area a multifaceted approach is
recommended Aggressive vector
control
strategies should be implemented at both
community and household levels integrating
them into a comprehensive plan to manage and
reduce malaria transmission Promoting the use
of insecticide treated nets and exploring
innovative methods to enhance net effectiveness
can significantly interrupt human vector contact
Intermittent preventive treatment particularly with
sulphadoxine pyrimethamine during the second

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Clinical decision support systems CDSSs can provide various functions and advantages to
healthcare delivery Quality healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth is of vital importance and machine
learning based CDSSs have shown positive impact on pregnancy care
Objective This paper aims to investigate what has been done in CDSSs in the context of pregnancy care using
machine learning and what aspects require attention from future researchers
Methods We conducted a systematic review of existing literature following a structured process of literature
search paper selection and filtering and data extraction and synthesis
Results research papers were identified on the topic of CDSS development for different aspects of pregnancy
care using various machine learning algorithms We discovered an overall lack of explainability in the proposed
models We also observed a lack of experimentation external validation and discussion around culture ethnicity
and race from the source data with most studies using data from a single centre or country and an overall lack
of awareness of applicability and generalisability of the CDSSs regarding different populations Finally we found
a gap between machine learning practices and CDSS implementation and an overall lack of user testing
Conclusioru Machine learning based CDSSs are still under explored in the context of pregnancy care Despite
the open problems that remain the few studies that tested a CDSS for pregnancy care reported positive effects
reinforcing the potential of such systems to improve clinical practice We encourage future researchers to take
into consideration the aspects we identified in order for their work to translate into clinical use
The rapid advancement of computer technology has led to an in
creasing interest in clinical decision support systems CDSSs which
are computer systems designed to impact clinician decision making
about individual patients at the point in time that these decisions are
made CDSSs can provide various functions and advantages to
healthcare delivery such as reducing medication errors and adverse
events improving clinical management controlling costs providing ad
ministrative function automation supporting diagnostics and decision
making improving documentation and streamlining clinical workflow
CDSSs can be especially helpful during the COVID pandemic
when many clinicians have turned to telemedicine in response to the
need for social distancing

CDSSs can be classified as knowledge based and non knowledge
based A knowledge based CDSS typically includes a knowledge base
consisting of compiled information that is often in the form of rules
and it combines the rules with patient data using an inference engine
or reasoning mechanism to create outputs On the contrary non
knowledge based CDSSs are data based and they do not rely directly on
medical guidelines or knowledge A common type of non knowledge
based CDSSs uses machine learning techniques and this type of CDSSs
is often referred to as machine learning based CDSSs Machine learning
is a type of artificial intelligence that learns from historical data
and uses what it learned to predict the outcomes for new data It is a
powerful tool to address complex problems and it can handle varieties
of data including numerical categorical time series textual and im
age data Machine learning is widely adapted in the medical field

and it has shown revolutionary improvements in many aspects of the
healthcare process Consequently there has been a rapid growth in
machine learning based CDSSs to help clinicians make better and more
informed decisions
Bias has been a major concern when applying machine learning in
practice as biases in the data such as ethnicity race or gender can
result in a biased model In the field of medicine there is a growing
demand for approaches to be trustworthy transparent interpretable
and explainable Antoniadi et al indicated that explainability is
a critical component for the effective uptake of CDSSs in practice and
it may become a requirement in the future due to ethical regulatory
and societal pressures This calls for explainable artificial intelligence
XAI to help uncover potential sources of bias and make the results
of systems more understandable to humans Various benefits
have been reported as a result of the use of XAI however XAI is still
not applied sufficiently in the context of machine learning based CDSSs
Quality healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth can prevent ad
verse pregnancy outcomes including maternal deaths and stillbirths
In the context of pregnancy care studies have shown that CDSSs
can identify complications during pregnancy improve quality of intra
partum care facilitate reduction of labor complications and improve
pregnancy outcomes and machine learning are being stud
ied to theoretically optimize a variety of pregnancy outcomes however
only a small proportion of studies that use Al machine learning to
improve pregnancy outcomes have developed CDSSs as an effort to
translate into clinical care
In this paper we comprehensively reviewed existing literature on
CDSSs in the context of pregnancy care that incorporate machine learn
ing techniques We aimed to identify what has been done in this field
and what aspects require attention from future researchers
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows in Section we
describe the structured processes used to conduct this review including
our research questions Section presents what we discovered from
literature in response to the research questions Section discusses the
implications of our findings in Section we conclude this paper

Results
RQI what CDSSs have been developed that used machine learning in
the context of pregnancy care and what machine learning AI methods were
used
There are various studies on or towards the development of machine
learning based CDSSs to assist healthcare delivery at different stages of
pregnancy and different machine learning techniques were used They
are summarised in Table
The studies cover preconception early pregnancy prenatal intra
partum and postpartum stages Most of the studies aimed to support
diagnosis prognosis and treatment in maternal and fetal care during
pregnancy and childbirth and the majority focused on the prenatal
and intrapartum period In addition the majority of studies aimed
to develop CDSSs that are exclusively machine learning based non
knowledge based Only one paper described the development of
CDSS that involves both machine learning techniques and a rule based
knowledge base which makes a hybrid of knowledge based and non
knowledge based system
There has been a growing number of papers published regarding
development of machine learning based CDSSs in the context of preg
nancy care in the last few years as shown in Fig This can be partly
explained by a rise of publications that study cardiotocograms which
may be a result of the availability of two open access cardiotocography
datasets UCI Machine Learning Repository Cardiotocography Data Set
and CTU CHB Intrapartum Cardiotocography Database

are the machine learning models developed in these studies
explainable
Explainability provides insights into the decision making process of
the machine learning based CDSSs There are two types of explanation
methods ante hoc and post hoc methods Ante hoc methods involve de
veloping machine learning models that are inherently transparent such
as linear and logistic regression decision tree and kNN They reveal
the decision logic to users and are referred to as white box models
When non explainable black box algorithms ANNs SVMs random
forests etc are used the models developed can be explained in a
post hoc manner Post hoc methods generate approximations of the de
cision logic of the models Post hoc explanations can be split into global
explanations which provide an overall understanding into a model s
behavior and local explanations which explain why a particular deci
sion output is made
Regarding the proportion of papers that develop white box and
black box machine learning models for CDSSs for pregnancy care
used white box models only which provide ante hoc explana
tions The majority of the papers developed black box models
only and developed both white box and black box models As
shown in Fig an increasing trend of using black box models for
CDSS development for pregnancy care in recent years especially be
tween and is observed However the number of papers

Discussion
Machine learning based CDSSs have been developed to assist clini
cians in various stages and aspects of pregnancy care from preconcep
tion to postpartum stages The main focus is on supporting diagnosis
prognosis and treatment for both pregnant women and babies during
pregnancy and childbirth The limited number n
of publica
tions towards the development of machine learning based CDSSs for
pregnancy care suggests that it is still an under explored area How
ever there is an increase in the number of studies in this field in recent
years partly because of the rise in research studying cardiotocography
data using machine learning
As explainability is becoming increasingly prominent for systems
it was of interest to identify to what extent these studies incorporated
this element in their work CDSS explainability has the potential to
enhance the clinicians trust towards the system
l while high
accuracy alone is insufficient especially as it is often achieved by
complex and opaque models Arrieta et al have recommended that
black box models should be selected only when necessary and the use
of white box models should be prioritised over complex algorithms that
require the application of post hoc XAI techniques The use of black
box models is prevalent in machine learning based CDSSs for pregnancy
care especially in the past few years Although there is an increasing de
mand to make approaches explainable in medicine an overall lack of
explainability and application of XAI methods is observed in this field
More than half of the CDSSs are not explainable A small proportion
used white box algorithms and only one paper used a model specific
post hoc explanation to explain black box machine learning models
globally Besides it comes to our attention that Du et al
provided
both post hoc global and local explanations in a web based CDSS for
the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus which was published af
ter the literature search of this review With recent user studies showing
the importance of XAI in CDSSs future researchers in related
fields should consider incorporating explainability into the system de
sign Also it is recommended in the World Health Organisation WHO
Guidelines for Health
There is a lack of awareness or specification of the cultural eth
nic racial groups in the training data Most studies used data collected
in a single centre or multiple centres within the same country This
is likely to reflect the local population and limits the diversity of par
ticipants As machine learning is data based it could limit the appli
cability and validity of the CDSSs on other populations This calls for
cross cultural ethnic racial validation of the CDSSs to evaluate system
generalisability in difference populations and studies on more diverse
populations If the former is not possible researchers should report
the cultural ethnic racial distribution or bias in the data and clearly
specify the applicability of the CDSSs in case of misuse Additionally
when reporting clinical trials involving interventions of an Al machine
learning based CDSS the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
Artificial Intelligence CONSORT call for descriptions of how
input data for the CDSS are acquired and the populations for which
CDSS intervention can be safely implemented This applies to machine
learning based CDSSs not only in the context of pregnancy care but
also in other medical fields
Although several studies have addressed major unmet needs in
the area of pregnancy care with the use of machine learning mod
els for CDSS development we identified that their research has in
most cases remained experimental In addition only a very limited
amount of machine learning based CDSSs have been tested by clini
cal users Nonetheless in these studies positive feedback was received
regarding reducing diagnostic errors supporting diagnosis and treat
ments and reducing clinicians workload This highlights the potential
of such systems in improving healthcare delivery especially in rural ar
eas where the healthcare practitioners might not be specialists
For future researchers who aim to test machine learning based CDSSs in
International Journal of Medical Informatics
randomised trials it is recommended to follow the CONSORT
and report the trials in a transparent and complete manner
In this work we identified several aspects that require attention in
order for machine learning based CDSSs to transfer into clinical use In
addition to those there are other persisting challenges including miss
ing values outliers and class imbalance These issues are
common in medical datasets and need to be addressed appropriately
We comprehensively reviewed CDSSs incorporating machine learn
ing techniques for pregnancy care Many of our findings are aligned
with previous reviews in related fields Davidson et al identified
limited external validation in in maternal healthcare Dhombres et
al found a lack of external validation and the fact that the contri
butions of remain at the level of proof of concept in the use of in
the obstetrics and gynecology domain Davidson et al discovered
a lack of clinical adoption in the use of and machine learning to im
prove pregnancy outcomes Drukker et al pointed out challenges
with black box models and the absence of wide scale multi centre clin
ical studies in the use of in ultrasound imaging in obstetrics and
gynecology These indicate that the gaps we identified have implica
tions on a broader context providing guidelines for future researchers
The contributions of our review are highlighted by a novel focus
on machine learning based CDSSs an area that endeavors to trans
late machine learning studies into clinical application and an in depth
analysis of explainability cultural ethnic racial bias system implemen
tation and user testing The literature search was conducted on Google
Scholar an academic search engine with a high level of comprehen
siveness As opposed to Dhombres et al who focused on obstetrics
and gynecology core journals only many of the papers we selected
were published in multidisciplinary journals of computer science and
medicine giving a more extensive overview of relevant literature
One of the limitations of this review is that the studies that were
not written in English or not accessible were excluded Additionally
the use of pregnancy as a search keyword may have led to the omis
Sion of some papers that focus on preconception and postpartum care
Nevertheless this review provides valuable insight into the state of the
art in this field and the aspects that require further research guiding
future researchers in related fields
Conclusion
This systematic review comprehensively reviewed and summarised
studies towards the development of CDSSs using machine learning for
different aspects of pregnancy care It is observed that black box algo
rithms are the most popular especially in recent years while the need
for explainability in the models or systems is not sufficiently addressed
We discovered that there is an overall lack of awareness experimen
tation external validation and discussion around culture ethnicity or
race and a lack of CDSS implementation and user testing Despite
the open problems that remain positive feedback from clinicians was
reported on the CDSSs that were tested reinforcing the potential of
such systems to improve clinical practice Our findings can serve as
guidelines for future researchers in related fields to assist them in in
corporating their work in clinical practice and having a higher impact
in the delivery of personalised care

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Introductiorr Barriers to family planning for potential clients have been explored in the literature but rarely from
the perspective of the women themselves in a low income setting This research aimed to understand clients
perspectives on being turned away from receiving a method of family planning at a facility on the day it was
sought
Methods Three focus group discussions were held in two districts of Malawi in with clients who had been
turned away approximately three to six months prior
Results The reasons for turnaway participants mentioned fell into eight categories no proof of not being preg
nant method and or supply stock outs arriving late provider unavailable provider refusal needing to wait
longer after delivery of a child financial constraints and medical reasons Participants were often turned away
more than once before finally being able to initiate a method in some cases returning to the same facility and in
others finding it through community health workers traditional healers or private facilities Clients often
resorted to sleeping apart from their husbands until they could initiate a method and reported stress and worry
resulting from being turned away
Conclusions Clients are turned away without a method of FP on the day they seek one for multiple reasons nearly
all of which are preventable Many examples given by the participants showed a lack of knowledge and respect
for clients on the part of the providers Changing attitudes and behaviour however may be difficult and will
require additional steps Increasing the availability and use of pregnancy tests having a more reliable supply of
methods and materials increasing the number of providers including those trained well in all methods and
providing daily FP services would all help reduce turnaway Improved access to family planning will help
counties achieve their Sustainable Development Goals
The importance of high quality family planning FP services in
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs cannot be under
estimated Traditionally recognised for its role in maternal and child
health FP also contributes to the success of the SDGs in eliminating
extreme poverty increasing health and well being ensuring quality
education for all and lessening the impact of climate change among
others
In million

women in low and middle income countries were estimated to have an
unmet need for FP
sully et al
In many cases unmet need can be
attributed to the various barriers women face in accessing FP
Starrs

Women must often overcome many barriers to FP before even
reaching a facility that provides it including taking time away from
domestic or income generating responsibilities to obtain services
finding the resources needed to arrive at the facility and in some cases
doing so while concealing their reason for the visit Women can

encounter other barriers after arriving at the facility resulting in them
being turned away without receiving a method Those FP barriers that
have been frequently categorised in the literature include geographic
e g long distances between clients and services financial e g un
affordable methods services or transportation to obtain a method and
medical barriers Bertrand et al Campbell et al Starrs
Medical barriers can include non medically necessary
et al
policies or practices that inappropriately prevent clients from receiving
the contraceptive method of their choice or impose unnecessary process
barriers to access family planning services Bertrand et al
For
example a medical barrier could include requiring direct observation of
menstruation i e a soiled menstrual pad to rule out pregnancy lab
tests or vaccinations Campbell et al Stanback et al
Brunie et al Hazel et al
Clients may also face barriers due
to a lack of information on how FP or particular methods work
stock outs of supplies or methods or bias on the part of providers Solo
and Festin Campbell et al Bertrand et al
In the case of provider bias providers may require clients to be
married or of a certain age or they may impose their own beliefs
regarding ideal family size or spacing of pregnancies including limiting
the use of contraception for nulliparous women or women who have had
fewer than the socially accepted number of children Campbell et al
Stanback and Twum Baah Tavrow et al Tumlinson
Providers may also determine the method dispensed to a
et al
client based on ease of initiation or availability of supplies rather than
client preference Solo and Festin Farmer et al Hasselback
et al
Many of the barriers to FP are related to the social determinants of
health including economic status area of residence education social
inclusion and non discrimination and access to affordable quality
health care Marmot et al These are defined by the WHO as
non medical factors that influence health outcomes World Health
Organization Marmot et al While social determinants of
health exist in countries of all income levels they can be harder to
overcome in low and middle income countries where resources and
alternatives are more limited
World Health Organization
Overcoming or minimizing the impact of social determinants of health is
a key element in helping the world to meet the SDGs and achieving
equity in health yet their presence can be noted in many of the afore
mentioned barriers to FP
United Nations
The term turnaway was first used by researchers exploring access to
abortion services in the United States from Biggs et al
In the Tavrow at al showed that many
Foster
Malawian women were denied FP at the facility entrance before even
seeing a provider for reasons including missing group counselling
coming on a non family planning day provider unavailability and un
availability of commodities Tavrow et al More than two de
cades later further research showed that Malawian women were still
being turned away from FP services for reasons including refusing other
services such as an HIV test or vaccination or a facility being closed
during normal operating hours
Hazel et al
Turnaway in Malawi
also resulted from closures or understaffing of facilities long wait times
stock out of methods preferred by the women or FP being offered only
on certain days of the week Peterson et al
Unlike evidence on the presence and types of barriers to accessing FP
facing women evidence on the impact of denying FP methods is sparse
Although related issues such as a limited
Solo and Festin
method mix resulting from provider bias or method stock outs have
been explored these studies have not given a strong voice to women on
the effects on their lives of limited choice and access Solo and Festin
Bertrand et al
In this paper we aim to give women the
opportunity to describe their experiences with turnaway from FP in
Malawi and explore and analyse the reasons women understood they
were turned away and the potential outcomes and consequences

Malawi is a country of approximately million people located in
southern Africa Central Intelligence Agency CIA It is divided
into three regions and districts with approximately of the
population living in rural areas Central Intelligence Agency CIA
Christianity is the most common religion with of the pop
ulation practising some type of Christianity whereas Muslims account
for of the population Central Intelligence Agency CIA
Malawi has a total fertility rate of an infant mortality rate of
per live births and a maternal mortality ratio of per
live births Malawi National Statistics Office World Health Or
ganization The modern contraceptive prevalence rate for mar
ried women is with an unmet need for FP of Malawi National
Statistics Office the turnaway rate has been estimated to be
for three districts studied Peterson et al Fewer than three
quarters of women are literate Malawi National Statistics Office
Malawi was one of few sub Saharan African countries to reach
the Millennium Development Goal to lower child mortality which
was achieved through general health system strengthening among other
activities Gunnlaugsson and et al
From to Malawi had a conservative FP policy in place
requiring women to be married undergo a full physical exam meet age
and parity restrictions and have permission from their husbands to
initiate FP Tavrovv Devlin et al Health facilities offered
FP services only once per week Tavrow In the Ministry of
Health and Population MOHP introduced a new FP policy relaxing
many of these restrictions
The policy eliminated re
Tavrow
quirements related to age parity and permission of husband and
allowed FP for limiting births rather than just birth spacing It also set
the expectation that FP services should be offered daily at MOHP
facilities
Today trained community health workers in Malawi are allowed to
initiate women on oral contraceptive pills OCPs and injectable
contraception but facility based services remain an important source of
FP for many women in Malawi Government of Malawi Ministry of
Facility based FP services are usually provided by nurses
Health
midwives clinicians and health surveillance assistants HSAs who
generally start with a group counselling session for prospective clients
which is held in the morning During each session various FP methods
are explained to clients including their possible side effects After the
group counselling session has ended clients speak with providers indi
vidually to decide upon and receive a method as appropriate and
available
Methodology
This qualitative study was part of a larger mixed method study that
gathered data on clients and providers from FP units in health fa
cilities in three districts in Malawi from October to December
Peterson et al Peterson et al In the first part of the
study clients who were turned away from receiving a method of FP at a
facility on the day they sought one participated in a survey on the day of
turnaway Clients who agreed and provided a phone number were fol
lowed up six and weeks post turnaway At the time of the week
follow up visit or the six week follow up for those reporting preg
nancy at six weeks research assistants asked clients via telephone if
they would be willing to participate in a focus group discussion FGD
The two districts with the highest turnaway rates were selected for the
FGDs Data collectors attempted to reach all clients who lived in the two
selected districts and stopped when they had eight participants agreeing
to participate No alternate participants were selected Turned away
clients were eligible for an FGD if they had access to a phone were
willing to be contacted and expressed interest in participating
We chose to use FGDs to allow women to share their experiences in
J M Peterson et al
their own words Qualitative research including FGDs allows for a
greater understanding of complex issues than quantitative methods
alone and offers greater opportunities to bring unanticipated findings to
light
Baum Bryman Krueger and Casey
In our
case a qualitative methodology put the turned away clients in the po
sition of expert witnesses and allowed researchers to see the world
through their eyes Bryman In some cultures participants may
feel shy about sharing personal information in a group setting In
Malawi however local researchers advised that clients would feel more
comfortable sharing personal information in an FGD than in individual
interviews because they would know in a group setting that others were
also sharing such information thus the risk of social desirability bias
would be reduced
Elrofaie
Study design and data collection
The qualitative data presented here are taken from three FGDs with
turned away clients conducted three to six months after turnaway The
number of FGDs was constrained by cost and feasibility The turned
away clients came from two districts in Malawi Kasungu and Zomba
The team intended to include six to eight participants per FGD but in
two cases five participants attended Discussions took place in a private
space at available primary school classrooms in each district in late
March and early April Clients participating in FGDs were
compensated Malawian kwachas or approximately US IO for
their time as required by the Malawian institutional review board the
National Health Sciences Research Committee NHSRC Although
COVID had not yet been detected in Malawi at the time of the FGDs
rates were rising throughout the world To accommodate social
distancing in their transportation to and from the FGDs participants
were offered transportation reimbursement and encouraged to use
transportation that could best ensure social distancing motorcycle taxi
in place of minibus for example Those needing reimbursement for
transportation received US US depending on the distance trav
elled and means of transportation used
The data collection team consisted of a lead interviewer and a note
taker both Malawian women with bachelor s degrees in relevant fields
and previous experience with qualitative data collection in health
related studies Both had participated in the quantitative portion of
the study and were familiar with the research goals and objectives Prior
to initiating the FGDs they received an additional two days of training
on qualitative data collection including modules on key components of
effective facilitation such as not interrupting respondents not making
assumptions about what participants will say and clarifying points that
are unclear
During the FGD the interviewer used a semi structured open ended
discussion guide to lead the participants through predetermined ques
tions and topics The research team developed the discussion guide after
analysis of the turnaway and follow up survey data The aim was to gain
a deeper understanding of those results by allowing the women to ex
press their views on their FP visits The broad topics included experi
ences with and reasons for turnaway perceptions of the quality of the
services they had received including their understanding of why they
had been turned away what clients do as a result of being turned away
and subsequent outcomes after turnaway The FGDs were conducted in
Chichewa
Data management and analysis
FGDs were audio recorded and transcribed directly into English by
the lead interviewer transcriptions were reviewed by the note taker
present at the FGDs Transcriptions included bracketed notes from the
transcriber lead interviewer to add context to comments where neces
sary Further context was provided by Malawian members of the
research team to its non Malawian members
We used grounded theory to analyse the transcripts first by open
Midwifery
coding to find similarities and differences in results then using axial
coding to establish connections between categories and subcategories
and finally selective coding to establish core categories themes and the
grounded theory
While we expected some topics to
Priest et al
overlap with what we had found in the quantitative surveys regarding
reasons for turnaway we chose to use a grounded theory framework to
allow for new categories to emerge and to capture nuances in how cli
ents might describe the reasons for turnaway and other topics explored
We allowed themes to develop across questions rather than simply
quantifying responses to particular questions
The transcripts were imported into NVivo QSR International Pty
Ltd
for analysis We performed inter coder agreement checks
with two coders and discussed any discrepancies until we reached
agreement Demographic information for the FGD participants was
based on follow up surveys conducted six and weeks post turnaway
Specific comments made during FGDs were not linked to the de
mographic details given at the time of the initial survey
Ethics
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by FHI s Pro
tection of Human Subjects Committee in Durham NC USA as well as
the National Health Science Research Committee in Malawi All study
staff completed training on research ethics the protocol and informed
consent administration All participants provided their written informed
consent to participate
Results
Three FGDs were held two in Kasungu District with five partici
pants each and one in Zomba District with six participants for a total of
Participant quotes are presented verbatim with minimal editing for
clarity
Participant background and demographic data
Demographic data for FGD participants were collected during the
exit survey conducted at the facility the day they were turned away and
was available for of the participants The participants were on
average age years range All but one was married and all
had given birth at least once including eight who had given birth within
six months of the day we first spoke to them Nine had a primary school
education and six had a secondary school education One of the par
ticipants reported on the six week survey that her partner disapproved
of her use of FP the others reported their partners had approved FP use
Based on the six week post turnaway survey eight of the FGD partici
pants were able to start a method by that time and three more were able
to start by weeks post turnaway
Reasons for turnaway
After establishing the meaning of the term turnaway with FGD
participants as leaving a health facility without a method of FP on the
day a client wanted one facilitators asked about why clients get turned
away Using thematic analysis as a part of our grounded theory frame
work we classified the reasons for turnaway most discussed into eight
categories Table All were mentioned in two or more FGDs
No proof of not being pregnant
Women discussed being turned away when they could not demon
strate they were not pregnant If a woman had missed a period or came
in between periods health workers asked her to come back after taking a
pregnancy test or while she was menstruating In some cases not
menstruating was mentioned in the context of initiating a new method
but in many cases the participants were referring to clients coming for a
reinjection Participants noted this was particularly unfair for women

Medical reasons
who missed a reinjection date by just a few days given that missing
periods while using injectable contraception is common
If the day you were appointed to come for FP and you did not come
and go the following day they turn you away so that you get a
pregnancy test first so they see evidence that you are eligible to
access FP FGD
If a woman has gone after the appointed date has passed she is told
to come back when she is menstruating It s not right because some
methods make some women not to menstruate For example Depo
injectable most people stop menstruating when they are using this
method and yet the providers want you to menstruate first as proof
that you are not pregnant This is not right FGD
Method and or supply stock outs
Facilities can run out of methods or the supplies needed to initiate a
method such as the trocar needed to insert a contraceptive implant
Known as stock outs this reason for turnaway was frequently
mentioned by FGD participants Specifically noted by the participants
were stock outs of injectables implants intrauterine devices IUDs and
insertion materials In some cases participants said that during a stock
Midwifery
out the providers would give them advice on where else they could go to
get the method or a future date when the method should be back in
supply Some women also mentioned being advised to use pills or con
doms while waiting for injectables to be available but other women
reported that they had not been offered any backup methods and had
simply been turned away One participant gave an example of the
consequences of stock outs
Sometimes they know that we are going to get our children checked
by the scale at the under five growth monitoring clinic but the
stock is little like for Depo injectable to cater for all of us They
communicate when we should come back but while waiting some
women end up pregnant FGD
Participants found it disappointing to be turned away for method or
supply stock outs but understood this reason for turnaway when all
women seeking that method were turned away
Arriving late
Participants explained that they can get turned away when there are
too many clients for providers to see by a certain time In one example a
participant reported that providers will see clients up until but any
clients still waiting at that time are asked to come back another day In
other cases clients who arrive late to the facility are turned away upon
arrival Like for Health Centre they open at clock so if you are
late beyond clock they send us away one client explained FGD
Another participant tried to access two services on one day making
her late for FP services
The second time I was turned away they said that I came in late
That day I was also weighing my child at the under five growth
monitoring clinic When I explained they said that I should only
come for one thing FGD
Being turned away for these reasons was frustrating for clients who
came long distances and preferred to receive more than one service in a
single trip to a facility but other participants saw it as fair
Provider unavailable
Providers must not only be present but also trained in all methods
Participants described being asked to return on a different day when the
provider trained to supply a particular method was not present on the
day they were seeking it For example if you want the method placed in
the arm the providers know that the person responsible to insert the
method is not around they advise that you come the following day when
the specific provider comes around FGD
Another client shared another example of a difficult to understand
reason for turnaway
Like when you go and you know that you don t react well to Depo
and you want to collect pills they tell you that we have no pills or
the person responsible to supply pills is not there You end up
disappointed because the pills are needed every day FGD
Clients also discussed that providers may get pulled in to work with
other clients such as those in need of immediate care leaving the FP
service area temporarily without a provider Although clients could
understand the need for FP providers to respond to emergency circum
stances they found this disappointing and frustrating
Provider refusal Participants described situations in which providers
refused to give them a method They had trouble understanding why
they should be turned away just because a provider was tired or wanted
to take a lunch break or had other responsibilities to tend to One
participant said The supplies may be available but the providers will
say they are tired and the clients won t get the methods FGD OI OI
More frequently mentioned was refusal when a client showed up for
J M Peterson et al
a reinjection but not on the assigned day One participant explained FP
days at our facility is Tuesday and Thursday If the appointment date
falls on a different day other than Tuesday or Thursday we are turned
back Sometimes we end up falling pregnant as a result of this FGD
In some cases that participants found frustrating providers appeared
to be saving the requested method for particular women such as those
who arrived in cars or who had personal connections to the providers
It also happens at our health facility that others access the same FP
methods you are going for and yet we are turned away Usually they
prefer well to do people those that have come by car go straight in
the provider room and get assisted while the rest of us are sent back
Sometimes they judge us with the way we are looking or are dressed
we are turned away without any assistance FGD
Needing to wait longer after delivery of a child Some FGD participants
had been told they had come to initiate FP too soon after delivery
Sometimes they tell us that the baby is still young so it is impossible to
get a method of FP before the baby reaches six weeks FDG
Participants said they had been told to wait until six weeks after the birth
of a child to initiate a method without mentioning the method they had
been denied or if they had been offered a backup method such as
progesterone only pills or IUDS which can be used immediately after
delivery
Payment requested Despite methods being offered for free at public fa
cilities FGD participants noted several examples of providers asking for
payments from clients Some participants mentioned providers selling
methods for a profit or needing to be connected to a provider to receive
methods that are in short supply One participant said It happens that
sometimes that some providers are selling the family planning
methods so maybe money is hard to find so we fail to access FP FGD
Another said
The providers share amongst themselves We go to the facilities and
they tell us that there is a stock out but the same provider will tell
you that the same method he has at home So I was wondering why
the FP services are found in their homes and not at the health facility
I did not go to their house to get a method FGD
Yet another participant mentioned making payments When asked to
clarify if the payment was for all services or particular services she
explained
It s mostly the method one is looking for to help build another
hospital Like when I went there they said we should pay
kwachas and then the person handling the records suggested that we
pay more the next time we go like add kwachas so that each one
should contribute kwachas approximately USD in total
FGD
Participants expressed frustration in these cases and did not under
stand why they should have to pay for methods that should be available
for free They reported refusing to pay and instead going without FP
until it could be obtained for free
Medical reasons Women also discussed medical reasons for being
turned away including showing up before a scheduled resupply or
reinjection date anaemia high blood pressure and risk of blood clots
One participant said For me when I was getting a removal they denied
me another method because I was told I have anaemia and so I was told
to wait for three months to observe the situation FGD
Participants understood that for medical reasons some methods
were incompatible with some women
Midwifery
What do clients do when turned away
Participants mentioned several approaches they take to cope when
turned away Most frequently mentioned was sleeping apart from their
husbands to abstain from sexual relations This was preferred to eating
sweets still in their wrappers the local saying used to describe having
sex with condoms But women also mentioned the failure to obtain a
contraceptive method leading to quarrels with their husbands who
sometimes felt their wives had deliberately failed to get a method
because they wanted more children
Other coping mechanisms discussed were returning to the facility on
a different day seeking FP through an outreach service and accepting a
second choice method in place of the one they preferred Accepting an
alternate method was usually noted in conjunction with a second or
third turnaway Going to an HSA who is a paid and trained community
health worker a traditional healer or an assistant at a private facility
were also mentioned One participant said there was nothing she could
do because other facilities did not exist in her area Several noted the
stress of the situation One participant said You get stressed when
turned away You go everywhere You ask friends neighbours and HSAs
for help FGD
Participants in all three of the groups discussed the advantages of
going to private facilities when they can afford it because at private
facilities all methods are in stock and available They tried other facil
ities either public or private when they felt they had not been treated
well by a provider or thought they had a better chance of accessing a
preferred method
I didn t take long before I sought a method I knew that my husband
sleeping alone was not a good idea so I tried hard to visit the Dis
trict Hospital to look for my method and so I got it a week later
FGD OI OI
Participants said they did not return to any facility when they were
geographically isolated and or had to pay large amounts for transport to
a facility Sometimes the transportation is tricky You see that you
travelled a long distance only to be turned away So you start
contemplating on not going back for fear of experiencing a similar
predicament FGD
Finally unwanted pregnancies were noted as an unfair consequence
of turnaway Sometimes you go to access FP methods and you are not
assisted it leads to an unexpected pregnancy so this is hurtful FGD
As described by another participant It s not right to be turned
away because if we get turned way there are high chances of us getting
pregnant and we will be giving birth frequently FGD OI OI
Multiple turnaways are common
Participants in the focus groups described being turned away one to
three times in relation to the time we first met them Many went back in
the week following the initial turnaway and were then able to initiate a
method But for others it was more difficult One participant said The
first time I was turned away was in December due to a holiday The
second time they told me there was a stock out of sterilizing materials I
got a method on my third try FGD
Another participant looking for an implant explained After being
turned away from my local health centre I went to another hospital
but I didn t find it again and then I found an outreach service and
that s where got it FGD
One participant spoke of finding implants stocked out twice and
then the materials for inserting implants were unavailable so she finally
agreed to an injectable instead Another participant said after two un
successful attempts at her local public facility she visited a private fa
cility and was able to initiate her chosen method
J M Peterson et al
Perceived quality of services
When asked about providers during the FGDs participants expressed
several concerns about the quality of the services provided For example
participants mentioned that providers do not always take the time to
explain methods and can treat clients poorly when they are in a hurry
Like when they want to inject us with Depo they do not consider that
we are in pain they just bring in many people and inject us in a hurry
then we go back home we start swelling up FGD
Clients said sometimes there are not enough staff and providers get
tired One participant suggested that providers be rotated among facil
ities We need to reshuffle the providers because the ones we have now
are used to us and don t respect us anymore FGD Participants
also reported that providers can be mean and shout at us
Some participants provided positive feedback related to providers
giving them comprehensive information on all methods and helping
them find the right one for their circumstances One participant recog
nised that providers give better information than friends do
The problem that I noticed amongst women is that we listen to our
friends we find out they are complaining about FP services and we
take it from them that there is no help we can get from the providers
We get easily discouraged but if we could take the initiative to hear
from the providers themselves I believe it would help us all FGD
Discussion
This qualitative research presents womenS experiences with and
perceptions of turnaway from receiving a method of FP in two districts
in Malawi Nearly all the reasons described for being turned away were
medically incorrect preventable and potentially harmful to women
seeking FP Clients described how not receiving FP on time either new
methods or resupplies was stressful for them and had real implications
Whether clients had to return to search for methods another day refrain
from sexual relations or adopt a second choice method it caused them
worry and inconvenience Although none of our participants mentioned
being pregnant at the time of the FGDs they discussed it as a possibility
Three additional reasons for turnaway were mentioned by women in
the FGDs that were not seen in the survey results Peterson et al
include provider refusal charging of informal fees and late arrival
Provider refusal included providers being tired or needing a
Table
break or giving preferential services for women assumed to be well
to do Providers charging informal fees another category of turnaway
not seen in survey results and preferential treatment have been seen
before for example in Kenya Tanzania Uganda Sierra Leone and
Malawi
Busse et al Tumlinson et al Tumlinson et al
Hunt Pieterse and Lodge Mamba et al
Identifying these barriers in interviews with the women seeking the
services but not in the survey illustrates the importance of applying
multiple research methods in exploring care seeking behaviour and its
outcome These practices raise issues of inequity of access to FP based on
socioeconomic status or personal connections to providers and should be
studied further to design and implement interventions to prevent them
Late arrival the third new category of reasons for turnaway
mentioned during the FGDs could be another aspect of inequity in
service delivery resulting from financial status women who cannot
afford to use transportation methods such as mini buses taxis or bicycle
taxis might be more likely to arrive late Women who live further from
facilities may also find it more difficult to arrive at a facility early in the
morning The impact of these potential inequities should be considered
when formal or informal policies on the availability of FP services based
on the day of the week or time of arrival at the facility are implemented

The women frequently mentioned the need to be currently

menstruating to receive a method In the era of cheap accurate preg
nancy tests estimated to cost a facility US O US O each in
Malawi in this requirement seems unnecessary Kolesar et al
Also Malawian providers pre service training materials include
the option for providers to rule out pregnancy in many cases through the
use of the Reasonably Sure Not Pregnant Checklist
Kolesar et al
Although
Ministry of Health and IntraHealth International
providers usually do not control whether a pregnancy test is available at
a facility they could use this checklist more frequently to rule out
pregnancy Peterson et al For the women needing to come to a
facility when menstruating is both costly and inconvenient and presents
extra challenges and added stress Peterson et al At the same
time the providers are navigating the dilemma of potentially initiating a
method to a pregnant woman against preventing a loss in confidence in
the effectiveness of modern FP methods
In the FGDs the women felt especially frustrated being scheduled for
re injection of injectable contraception on a non FP day refused that
day and then denied a re injection again for coming in a day or two late
on the closest FP day to their scheduled appointments Officially
Malawi follows the World Health Organization s medical eligibility
criteria which state that women can come up to two weeks before or
four weeks after a scheduled appointment date to receive a re injection
but this does not appear to happen consistently in practice Ministry of
Health and IntraHealth International As noted by one partici
pant asking women who are current users of injectables to wait until
they begin menstruating again seems unreasonable especially given
that this can take several months
DEPO PROVERA medrox
yprogesterone acetate injection spi Providing FP services daily is
in line with MOHP expectations and is reasonable particularly for
re injections which require little time for counselling
Stock outs of supplies and methods lead to turnaway but are nor
mally out of the control of individual providers A worldwide shortage of
injectable contraception in due to the shutdown of a manufacturer
sterilizing facility U S Food and Drug Administration
likely
affected the supply of injectables in Malawi during our research In
addition ordering and delivering commodities is a complex process
involving a host of players including pharmacy technicians FP co
ordinators working for the Reproductive Health Unit in the MOHP the
MOHP Health Technical Services and Support Unit and the Central
Medical Stores Trust which is responsible for procurement
Govern
ment of Malawi This system has been noted to lack account
ability perhaps allowing individual providers to sell methods on the side
Government of Malawi an issue raised by the women These
findings are in line with other research in Malawi showing the leakage
of essential drugs from official health facility stocks as well as the fre
quency with which others have seen official drugs being sold through
unofficial channels Carlson et al Msoma et al
Conse
quently to effectively limit turnaway of women seeking FP and support
the providers better control around essential drugs is crucial
The FGD highlighted turnaway resulting from having too few pro
viders or providers not trained on all methods Low caregiver to patient
ratios are seen throughout sub Saharan Africa including in Malawi
where there are just seven nurses or midwives per people World
Health Organization Providers in Malawi have expressed
frustration with being short staffed or not having staff trained in all
methods Peterson et al Mwafulirwa et al
Overworked providers grow weary and frustrated when
et al
they cannot keep up with their workloads or do not have the supplies
and training needed to do so Yet lashing out at clients or treating them
in a rude and disrespectful manner as described in the FGDs and re
ported elsewhere Tumlinson et al Nalwadda et al
Mannava et al is unacceptable Furthermore providers should
not partake in selective practices with women who appear to be
financially advantaged having better access to services and methods
than those judged to be poorer as was described in the FGD
Stock outs and staffing issues including training on all methods as
J M Peterson et al
well as client eligibility are systemic challenges that should be
addressed by the MOHP and district authorities For example providers
should know that clients should be able to receive progesterone only
pills any time after delivery and that an IUD can be inserted within
hours of delivery or after four weeks as well as the medical eligibility
criteria for reinjections of injectable contraception Ministry of Health
and IntraHealth International Efforts should also be made at a
systemic level to eliminate the occurrence of providers privately selling
methods acquired through unofficial channels or giving preferential
treatment to some clients Providing turned away clients with alterna
tive options such as referrals to other means of initiating FP through
outreach facilities or HSAs and talking to them consistently about
second choice methods are other practical steps that can be taken to
ensure the FP needs of women in Malawi are met in a timely manner
In this study Malawian women draw attention to their experiences
of being turned away when seeking FP Most of the reasons they high
light are preventable indicating that these barriers can be removed if
there is a will for systemic changes and if providers adopt a client
centred approach that enables easy access to the methods of contra
ception Malawian women need and are entitled to receive If these
barriers are addressed while giving due attention to the provider per
spectives Peterson et al policymakers and program imple
menters will be able to reduce FP turnaway not only in Malawi but with
potential implications elsewhere
A strength of this study is that it provides information on an
understudied area the impact of client turnaway on women and their
families in their own words The study is unique because it recruited
women who had been followed longitudinally to understand their ex
periences with and the outcomes of turnaway Another strength of the
research is the diversity of the research team The composition of the
team which included men and women Malawians and non Malawians
and a generational spread allowed us to reflect on how these and other
characteristics may have influenced the research and to attempt to
mitigate any personal interference in how the participant voices were
heard and understood Nonetheless the sample was limited to clients
with access to a mobile phone who were willing to be contacted two
factors that could bias the results The number of FGDs is another lim
itation the research struggled with sample size because it started just as
the COVID pandemic began when people were becoming wary of
going out or gathering with others Given that most of the reasons for
turnaway were discussed in multiple FGDs however we consider the
results a reliable representation of the range of reasons why women have
been turned away
Conclusions
Clients are turned away without a method of FP on the day they seek
one for multiple reasons nearly all of which are preventable Many ex
amples given by the participants showed a lack ofknowledge and respect
for clients on the part of the providers At the same time the practical
constraints experienced by the providers can not be underestimated and
need to be simultaneously addressed Thus health policymakers aiming
to improve FP services need to consider the perspectives of the FP pro
viders as well as those of the clients as presented here
Ensuring providers have a client centred attitude and improving
their morale motivation and practices could improve client provider
interactions Changing attitudes and behaviour however may be diffi
cult and will require additional steps such as additional training and
oversight In addition increasing the availability and use of pregnancy
tests having a more reliable supply of methods and materials increasing
the number of providers including those trained well in all method
s and providing daily FP services would all help reduce turnaway
Enabling all medically eligible women who are seeking a method of FP
to obtain one the day it is first sought will help Malawi and other low
and middle income countries achieve their SDGs in women and chil
dren s health and beyond

Results We studied patients mean SD age years mean disease duration
years being treated at Spanish hospitals Overall of women were considered to have
moderate to severe psoriasis by their physicians perceived severity ratings were significantly
higher among women Psoriasis affected the women s desire to become pregnant or led to
their delaying pregnancy in in respondents They were concerned that their condition might
worsen if they had to discontinue or switch treatment or that the treatment might harm the
baby Approximately half of the women had not received family planning counseling from their
physicians and this was more likely to be the case among never pregnant women Women on
biologic therapy had better psoriasis control and a better quality of life than women
on other treatments Their sexual health was also less affected
Conclusions Women with psoriasis have numerous family planning concerns which in some
cases can lead them to delay pregnancy or affect their desire to become pregnant Dermatolo
gists need to receive better training regarding family planning in women with psoriasis so that
they can provide their patients with more and better information

Psoriasis has a negative effect on patients quality of life
In Spain the prevalence of psoriasis is affecting appro
ximately million persons with little variation between the
sexes Onset is between the second and fourth decades
of life in of cases that is coinciding with a woman s
reproductive years causing concern and uncertainty with
respect to owing to the lack of information on
family planning pregnancy and breastfeeding According
to the BIOBADADERM registry women with moderate to
severe psoriasis in Spain are less likely to become pregnant
and breastfeed than the general population
The course of psoriasis during pregnancy is unpre
dictable Symptoms improve in around half of pregnant
women remain unchanged in others and worsen in more
than Moreover symptoms worsen after delivery in
Uncontrolled psoriasis during pregnancy is associated
with complications for both mother and fetus
While
many psoriasis treatments are potentially teratogenic
current therapeutic options are compatible with pregnancy
and breastfeeding
The main objectives of the present
study were as follows to determine the impact of psoriasis
on the desire to become pregnant and on breastfeeding to
learn more about the concerns and fears of women with the
disease before during and after pregnancy and to analyze
Til
N A Cantero R Ruiz Villaverde et al
the information on family planning pregnancy and breast
feeding they receive at the clinic with the aim of ensuring
that the information provided by their dermatologist is as
complete and exhaustive as possible depending on their indi
vidual needs The secondary objectives were to evaluate
differences in the impact of the disease concerns and infor
mation depending on whether the woman had been pregnant
or had a child treatment with biologics and disease activity
according to the patient or to the physician
Methods
We performed a multicenter cross sectional descriptive
observational study Patients were selected during visits to
the dermatologist at Spanish clinics and included between
March and October
Study Population
The study population comprised women with plaque pso
riasis aged years who were candidates for systemic
treatment and who agreed to participate in the study We
excluded patients with psoriatic arthritis to focus on the
skin and minimize variability patients who did not wish to
participate and patients who were not sufficiently literate
to participate
Variables and Data Collection
We collected clinical variables including the Psoriasis Area
Severity Index PASI Body Surface Area BSA perceived
activity of psoriasis by the physician on a visual analog scale
VAS comorbid conditions and previous and current
treatment Quality of life was evaluated using a qualitative
scale
Supplementary material and the Dermatology Life
Quality Index DLQI
Patients responded anonymously with their sociode
mographic data and their perception of the activity of
their psoriasis on a hard copy questionnaire The ques
tionnaire comprised items addressing family planning
and was specifically designed for the study Supplementary
material The investigators drafted the questionnaire ad
hoc for this project taking into account the study objec
tives Items and addressed concerns and information
before pregnancy and the impact of the disease Item
evaluated the impact of the disease on the patient s sexual
health Items addressed concerns and information
during pregnancy and items and addressed these
areas after pregnancy The remaining items assessed
information provided by the physician and other media
The results were used to prepare a table covering areas
to address during visits

Discussion
Recent studies indicate that women with moderate
to severe psoriasis in Spain are less likely to become
and less given to breastfeeding than the general
population The underlying reasons for this finding include
psychological causes feelings of low self esteem stigma
tization and a loss of confidence that leads to sexual
problems social and family related problems and concern
over the effects of treatment on the fetus Our survey
showed that more than of patients believed that if
they received more information from their physician they
would reconsider the desire to have children Therefore
in line with a recent consensus statement I we think
that physicians should be more proactive in providing this
information
Table
Psoriasis in women is diagnosed at a mean age of years
with initiation of treatment at years that is when
reproductive activity is highest In our study the mean age
was years and the disease had been progressing for
years therefore our study population is representative
of women during their peak reproductive period Psoria
sis has a considerable physical and emotional impact on
women affects their quality of life to a greater extent than
it does that of men affects their sexual relations and gen
erates uncertainty over the possible effects of the disease on
motherhood
Little is known about these aspects which
may be undervalued in clinical practice
Our cohort brings together patients with a significant
disease burden The impact of the disease reduces the
desire to become pregnant or delays pregnancy in one third
of patients The survey revealed some of the concerns
that could account for these fears which are associated
mainly with the safety of treatment the course of the
disease and the lack of information Most women are wor
ried that the treatment could harm the baby although
they are also concerned that the disease could worsen by
stopping or changing treatment before pregnancy during
pregnancy or during breastfeeding
The data suggest that the information provided in the
dermatology clinic on family planning desire to become
pregnant and safety of treatment is insufficient both
before conception and during pregnancy and breastfeeding
especially in women who have not previously been preg
nant We think that all women of reproductive age should
receive appropriate information at the clinic Moreover up
to of pregnancies are not planned therefore in line
with other authors we believe that women of reproduc
tive age should be provided with a treatment plan that is
compatible with pregnancy irrespective of their intentions
with respect to family planning Furthermore it is important
to train and improve the role of dermatologists as providers
of information on family planning
Our results suggest that women taking biologics are fol
lowed up more appropriately and have a better quality
of life with less impact of the disease on sexual health
than patients not taking biologics Treatment of psoriasis

Treatments to be avoided during

aSourced from reliable information on family planning in women with psoriasis e g information from scientific societies or patient
associations analyzed by specialists
during pregnancy and breastfeeding is challenging for the
clinician
While numerous therapies with potential ter
atogenic effects must be withdrawn before conception
some treatments can be used safely during pregnancy and
breastfeeding and we should inform patients in this regard
Certolizumab pegol is the safest biologic in both pregnancy
and breastfeeding given that its passage across the pla
centa to the mother s milk is minimal or nonexistent
Pregnant women treated with biologics can continue treat
ment during the first and second trimesters The risks and
benefits of continuing treatment during the third trimester
can be discussed with the patient However patients tak
ing certolizumab pegol can continue to do so throughout
their pregnancy if considered clinically necessary as well
as during breastfeeding
It has been shown that in both healthy women
and in women with other chronic diseases
attitude
toward pregnancy is influenced by perception of risk
Chronic diseases are associated with various risks dur
ing pregnancy and the perception of risk is unique to
each individual and not based only on objective information
with respect to the risk Therefore further research
is necessary to understand women s perception of risk
in specific chronic diseases In addition efforts must be
made to improve the information provided to patients on
objective risks
In the specific case of psoriasis recent
guidelines address patient management
Our study is limited by its cross sectional descriptive
and observational design and the fact that it lacks a con
trol group comprising women without psoriasis or male
patients with psoriasis However we believe that our sam
ple is representative of women of reproductive age seen
at dermatology clinics in Spain and who provide some
indication of their needs and concerns with respect to
family planning Our findings lead us to believe that it is
essential to provide more information to patients at the
clinic
Conclusions
The results of our study suggest that psoriasis has an impact
on family planning and desire to become pregnant Various
concerns may affect a woman s desire to become preg
nant or delay pregnancy The information provided on these
aspects during follow up is not complete

ABSTRACT
Introduction Medicaid family planning waivers can increase access to health care services and have been associated
with lower rates of unintended pregnancy which are associated with a higher risk of negative birth outcomes such as
preterm birth and low birthweight The objective of this study was to test the effect of Georgia s Medicaid family
planning waiver Planning for Healthy Babies on pregnancy characteristics and birth outcomes
Materials and Methods We used the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System PRAMS survey data in pre
and two post periods We identified those likely eligible for in Georgia n and
comparison states n and tested for effects using state and year fixed effects difference in differences modeling
Results was associated with a percentage point pp decrease in unintended pregnancy in the immediate
post period p and an pp decrease in the later post period p For the immediate post period
was also associated with a pp increase in the probability of prepregnancy contraception p and a pp
decrease in the probability of a very low birthweight VLBW birth p The reduction in VLBW birth was significant
for non Hispanic Black mothers pp p but not for mothers of other races ethnicities
Discussion Medicaid family planning waivers are an important structural policy intervention that can improve repro
ductive health care particularly in states without Medicaid expansion These waivers may also help address long
standing racial ethnic disparities in access to reproductive health care and potentially adverse pregnancy and birth
outcomes However the initial increase in pregnancies among people using contraception indicates that care must be
taken to ensure that recipients have access to effective methods of contraception and receive counseling on effective use
in order to avoid unintended consequences as more individuals try to prevent a pregnancy

Prior Literature Examining Impacts of Medicaid Family Planning
Waivers
Studies of Medicaid family planning waivers indicate that
they have led to improvements in family planning
Bronstein
et al Kearney Levine and contraceptive service
use
Adams et al Dunlop et al Five studies
examined the effect of Medicaid family planning expansions on
pregnancies and births Adams et al examined pregnancy rates
following two state specific waiver implementations noting a
percentage point pp decline in current pregnancies among
nulliparous those who have never given birth in California
Adams et al and a pp decline in unintended preg
nancies ending in live birth in Oregon Adams et al Foster
et al
estimated that nearly unintended preg
nancies were averted by California s waiver and both
Lindrooth and McCullough
and
Kearney and Levine
estimated that states implementing Medicaid family
planning expansions experienced reductions in overall births to
adults Kearney Levine Lindrooth McCullough
Kearney and Levine
reported a reduction in births
among nonteens when results were scaled up to reflect those
newly eligible for a waiver Relatedly studies report reductions in
public spending for unplanned pregnancies and births
Amaral
et al Kearney Levine and increases in preven
tive health service use e g routine checkups cervical cancer
screening STI testing Adams et al Dunlop et al
Wherry following waiver implementation
In addition Medicaid family planning expansions are an
example of structural policy interventions that may promote
more equitable access to coverage for family planning and
related services which is particularly important given the
prevalent racial and ethnic disparities in uninsurance Artiga
et al
and reproductive health care access and outcomes
Dehlend orf et al Sutton et al Thompson et al
To our knowledge only two analyses have examined the
effects of Medicaid family planning waivers on racial and ethnic
disparities finding that waivers are associated with greater re
ductions in very low birthweight VLBW births among Black vs
white teens Bryant et al and racial and ethnic disparities
in the use of highly effective methods of contraception
Dehlendorf et al However important gaps in the liter
ature remain Although some studies have examined the effect of
Medicaid family planning waivers on pregnancy and birth out
comes few have examined pregnancy characteristics i e preg
nancy intention and pregnancy prevention efforts and birth
outcomes such as low birthweight LBW and VLBW births
Bryant et al Dehlendorf et al
Georgia s Medicaid Family Planning Waiver
Georgia s Planning for Healthy Babies Program is
Georgia s Section a Medicaid family planning demonstra
tion waiver Implemented in January expanded
eligibility for family planning and family planning related ser
vices to uninsured Georgia residents aged years who are
able to become pregnant and have family incomes at or below
of the federal poverty level FPL FPL as of April
but are otherwise ineligible for Georgia s Medicaid or Children s
Health Insurance Program CHIP covers family planning
and family planning related services and supplies including all
methods of contraception approved by the U S Food and Drug
Administration STI testing and treatment Pap smears pelvic
exams colposcopies contraceptive management education
and counseling and other services routinely provided in a family
planning setting Georgia s waiver is unique in that it explicitly
includes the goals of reducing LBW and VLBW birth rates along
with the number of unintended pregnancies and Medicaid costs
These goals were reinforced with a unique component that
provides Medicaid coverage of selected services postpartum for
individuals giving birth to a VLBW infant Analyzing effects of
Georgia s waiver provides insight on access to reproductive
health care in a state that has not expanded Medicaid and one
that has among the poorest and most disparate maternal out
comes in the nation We use a quasi experimental design and
data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
PRAMS to examine the effects of on pregnancy charac
teristics and birth outcomes among individuals in Georgia
compared with similar individuals in comparison states We also
examine racial and ethnic differences in these effects

Materials and Methods
Data Source and Study Sample
The PRAMS is a mixed mode population based state specific
surveillance system of selected maternal behaviors and experi
ences before and during pregnancy and months following
birth of a liveborn infant administered in partnership between
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and state
health departments Shulman et al PRAMS data comprise
pregnancies ending in live birth and currently cover approxi
mately of all U S births Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Individuals with a live birth are sampled
using state birth certificate files to ensure representativeness of
live births in the state PRAMS oversamples subpopulations of
particular public health interest and these are stratified using
various stratification variables including maternal age race
ethnicity infant birth weight and geographic area
Shulman
To ensure high quality data the CDC uses a
et al
response rate threshold for making PRAMS data publicly avail
able
Shulman et al ranging from to during our
study period Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
We made no restriction to the sample based on multi
ple gestation or other criteria
Our study sample included data before the imple
mentation of and two post periods both
before and after Affordable Care Act
ACA implementation We excluded data from the year of
implementation as most pregnancies births in this year
began before implementation PRAMS data from Georgia for
were not publicly available as the required response
rate threshold was not met Using PRAMS data it is not possible
to identify enrollees directly Our study population con
sisted of PRAMS respondents who were uninsured prepregnancy
and had a Medicaid paid birth These individuals likely met the
income criteria did not qualify for Medicaid as a low
income parent but did qualify when pregnant and met the key
criteria of being uninsured Using the PRAMS data and
these criteria we identified comparison groups consistently
across states and over time
We identified comparison states as those with PRAMS data
available during the study period no Medicaid family plan
ning waiver first implemented during the study period and no
change to an existing Medicaid family planning waiver during
the study period Comparison states were Alaska Colorado
Delaware Hawaii Massachusetts Nebraska Ohio Tennessee
Utah and West Virginia We used all listed states as comparison
states in the immediate post period and non
Medicaid expansion states Nebraska Tennessee and Utah as
the relevant comparison states in the later post period
A key criterion in selecting our comparison states was a
formal test of equality in trends of outcome measures in Georgia
and the comparison states We adopted the event study
approach to investigate how trends in outcomes between groups
evolved before and after implementation This approach
allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption is
reasonable in the difference in difference models We found
limited evidence of a systematic difference in the pre policy
trends between the comparison states and Georgia over the
short pre period for which we have data Appendix Figures
In addition to examining pre trends the event study model
allowed us to examine how effects change over each post
implementation period and years We conducted
two sensitivity analyses using a subset of comparison states
states that did not expand Medicaid during our full study period
Nebraska Tennessee and Utah and states with data avail
able for each year included in the analysis Alaska Colorado
Massachusetts and Utah
Outcome Variables
We examined two outcomes related to pregnancy charac
teristics unintended pregnancy ending in live birth and
pregnancy prevention efforts We also examined two birth out
comes LBW grams and VLBW grams
births
Unintended Pregnancy Ending in Live Birth
We assessed unintended pregnancy ending in live birth using
constructed dichotomous measures that account for changes in
PRAMS questionnaires over time For all years PRAMS re
spondents are asked Thinking back to just before you got preg
nant with your new baby how did you feel about becoming
pregnant We classified births as unintended if the response
included wanted to be pregnant later or didn t want to be
pregnant then or at any time in the future Births were considered
intended if the response included wanted to be pregnant
sooner or wanted to be pregnant then Starting in an
additional response choice was added I wasn t sure what I
wanted if a respondent indicated this response the birth was
classified based on the answer to a second question When you
got pregnant with your new baby were you trying to get pregnant
Births in which respondents were not sure how they felt but
were not trying to get pregnant were classified as unintended
We tested additional models using an unintended pregnancy
measure that excluded respondents who were unsure what they
wanted Finally we completed a separate analysis of whether a
respondent was trying to get pregnant based on the answer to
the following yes no question When you got pregnant with your
new baby were you trying to get pregnant
Pregnancy Prevention Efforts
We assessed respondents reports of efforts to prevent preg
nancy in both the preconception and postpartum periods
Pregnancy prevention during the preconception period was
based on the yes no response to the question When you got
pregnant with your new baby were you or your husband or partner
doing anything to keep from getting pregnant This question lists
common things people use to keep from getting pregnant
including birth control pills condoms withdrawal or natural
family planning Pregnancy prevention postpartum was based on
the yes no response to the question Are you and your husband
or partner doing anything now to keep from getting pregnant
Birth Weight
We defined births as LBW if grams and VLBW if
grams

Descriptive Analysis
We examined differences in maternal characteristics among
the study population in Georgia and the comparison states
during the study period using univariate and bivariate analyses
Differences across the two groups were examined using tests
and or t tests as appropriate We examined intrastate differ
ences in outcomes preimplementation compared with the im
mediate post period and a later post period
using regression analysis
Multivariable Analysis
We investigated the relationship between and preg
nancy prevention and birth outcomes using two way i e state
and year fixed effects FE modeling We estimated the
following multivariable logistic regression models

Results
Descriptive Analyses
Table
displays sample sizes and maternal characteristics
among PRAMS respondents in Georgia and the comparison
states The two samples were comparable with regard to age
distribution with more than two thirds of respondents aged
years in both samples There were significant differences in
the racial ethnic distribution of the samples with Georgia
exhibiting more racial diversity In Georgia of the sample
identified as non Hispanic Black compared with in the
comparison group whereas slightly fewer identified as
Hispanic compared with in the comparison group
Compared with individuals in comparison states individuals
giving birth in Georgia were significantly less likely to have some
college be married or report smoking or drinking before preg
nancy but more likely to have had prior births Finally in
dividuals in Georgia reported significantly fewer experiences of
stressful events during the months before birth Maternal
characteristics among PRAMS respondents in Georgia and in
each group of comparison states stratified by imple
mentation are presented in Appendix Tables and
The descriptive data presented in Table examine changes in
the study outcomes stratified by sample Georgia vs comparison
states from the preimplementation period to the immediate
post period and the later post period overall and by race
ethnicity The results indicate a reduction in the first measure of
unintended pregnancy for both groups in the later post period
Among Georgia PRAMS respondents there was a pp
reduction in the second measure of unintended pregnancy in the
immediate post period and a pp reduction in the later post
period whereas a significant reduction in the comparison states
was only observed in the later post period Regarding precon
ception pregnancy prevention there was a large increase
pp in the percentage of respondents reporting preconception
pregnancy prevention efforts in Georgia in the immediate post
period and no significant increase among those in
comparison states
Neither sample showed an increase in the use of pregnancy
prevention postpartum in the immediate post period but post
partum prevention declined significantly for both groups in the
later post period There was not a significant change in LBW
births among the sample in Georgia or the comparison states
whereas there was a significant decline in VLBW births from
to among the sample in Georgia from the pre period to
the later post period With regard to differences by race
ethnicity the percentages of non Hispanic Black respondents in

Discussion
Findings from this study suggest that Georgia s Medicaid
family planning waiver was associated with reduction in
the rate of unintended pregnancy ending in live births and an
increase in preconception pregnancy prevention Stratified ana
lyses suggest that the positive impacts of on birth out
comes occurred among non Hispanic Black mothers who
disproportionately experience adverse pregnancy outcomes
Increased prepregnancy prevention and reductions in VLBW and
LBW infants were found among non Hispanic Black mothers in
the immediate post period
Although the effects found here align closely with the goals of
the inconsistent finding of both increased pregnancy
prevention preconception and increased unintended births is
suggestive of an increase in less effective contraceptive methods
or ineffective use with This is important to consider given
that failure rates of oral contraception have been found to be

Jackson et al Kost et al Sundaram et al
Our
results indicate that the effect of on pregnancy prevention
preconception held for non Hispanic Black individuals but the
inconsistent finding noted previously held only for non Hispanic
white individuals and only in the immediate post period This
may indicate that non Hispanic Black individuals in Georgia
found increased access to family planning and potentially to
effective methods with the implementation of It may also
indicate differences in how non Hispanic white individuals
respond to a question about intendedness post childbirth and or
when their intention was to give birth but to do so later Previous
research using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study
found that Black mothers had higher relative risks of reporting
an unwanted birth rather than an intended or mistimed birth
compared with white mothers Guzman et al
Our finding that now renewed through was
associated with increases in preconception pregnancy preven
tion echoes previous literature suggesting family planning ex
pansions lead to increased contraceptive use Adams et al
Dunlop et al Redd Hall Similarly previous
studies note an association between Medicaid family planning
expansions and reductions in unintended pregnancies ending in
live births Adams et al Foster et al It is difficult to
compare our findings with the study of Foster et al as it
used a Markov chain to predict the number of live births pre
vented however the PRAMS based study reported a similar
reduction of pp in unintended pregnancies ending in live
birth in Oregon Adams et al Additional studies examined
the effect of Medicaid family planning expansions on birth rates
directly
Kearney Levine Lindrooth McCullough
Kearney and Levine estimated a reduction in
live births among adults newly eligible for a family planning
waiver The current study adds to the literature by examining
both preconception contraception use and unintended preg
nancies ending in live birth The differential findings by race
ethnicity provide new insights that need further research and
review Analysis of the later post period adds important
information on potential longer term effects of a Medicaid family
planning waiver in states that have not expanded Medicaid
Addressing existing racial ethnic disparities in maternal and
infant outcomes continues to be critical and PRAMS data high
light the disparities in LBW and VLBW births between non
Hispanic Black and white mothers in Georgia and comparison
states As U S rates of maternal morbidity and mortality exceed
those of other industrialized nations and differences by maternal
race ethnicity persist the need for structural changes to the U S
health care system grows increasingly apparent Crear Perry
et al
Our finding that the associations of
with reduced unintended pregnancy and poor birth outcomes
were concentrated among non Hispanic Black mothers in
Georgia suggests the program may have lessened these racial
disparities
However it is important to note that simply expanding
eligibility for Medicaid family planning services does not guar
antee equitable access to services and correspondingly improved
health outcomes indeed the measures used in this analysis do
not assess reproductive autonomy instead simply measuring
reproductive health service use and outcomes Recent qualitative
work examining structural racism that Black women in the South
experience when accessing sexual and reproductive health ser
vices highlights important limitations of Medicaid family
planning coverage Thompson et al Thompson et al
conducted focus groups and in depth interviews with
Black women living in Georgia and North Carolina and found
that even with Medicaid coverage respondents reported dis
rupted reproductive health care use and insurmountable finan
Cial barriers to receiving services These findings highlight the
importance of understanding that even though efforts to expand
access are encouraging structural overhauls within state
Medicaid programs are needed to ensure that beneficiaries have
access to timely high quality reproductive health care
Even as states have expanded Medicaid policymakers should
recognize and address the gaps in coverage that remain for in
dividuals with incomes higher than FPL who may become
Medicaid eligible based on pregnancy Without family planning
waivers or other policies providing preconception and post
partum coverage individuals falling into coverage gaps typically
lack access to high quality family planning and other health care
services critical to their reproductive care Expanding access to
non Medicaid subsidized insurance such as the Marketplace to
uninsured individuals of reproductive age has the potential to
reduce insurance churning pre and postpregnancy and
Medicaid paid births while improving birth outcomes such as
breastfeeding
We note that Georgia like many
Palmer
other states is implementing a permanent I year postpartum
Medicaid coverage option made available to states by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act of
Limitations
This study is subject to limitations First we measure unin
tended pregnancies ending in live births and hence cannot
measure effects on all unintended pregnancies Second although
the PRAMS data have been successfully used to evaluate family
planning waivers using a treatment group as defined here leaves
room for misclassification For example individuals who would
have been eligible for Medicaid as low income parents but who
did not enroll prepregnancy will be included in the treatment
group as will teens who are otherwise eligible for CHIP
Compared with the target population of uninsured in
dividuals otherwise ineligible for Medicaid they are younger
have lower incomes and may more likely be citizens than those
enrolling only at delivery These factors may increase their
probability of unintended pregnancy and hence bias our
measured effect downward Third we do not observe the preg
nancy outcomes among those actually enrolling in Given
the intent to treat nature of this study the effect we estimate is
by definition lower than the effect of those treated The PRAMS
treatment group in may have characteristics different
from those who enrolled in if those in more need of
coverage for family planning and related services actually
enrolled substantiating a lower bound effect measured here We
note that the PRAMS data are limited in that we cannot examine
outcomes among groups such as Asian Americans Pacific Is
landers American Indians Alaska Natives or those with multi
racial identities We also cannot speak to the specific types of
prepregnancy contraceptive methods used the PRAMS question
lists common methods people use including both more and less
effective methods Finally we were unable to account for the
small number of clusters in our multivariable models with ap
proaches such as wild cluster bootstrapping when using complex
survey data commands needed for PRAMS this may affect our
standard errors and hence affect significance

ABSTRACT
Introduction Recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasize the importance of access
to comprehensive family planning services and recommend patient centered contraceptive counseling be incorporated
into routine primary care visits for reproductive age individuals This study aims to describe family planning service
provision in outpatient care settings and assess differences by facility and clinician characteristics
Methods Using National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data a nationally representative survey of outpatient care
visits we assessed family planning service provision by facility location facility type physician specialty types of cli
nicians seen and whether the patient was seen by their primary care provider We used random intercept logistic
regression with robust standard errors adjusting for patient characteristics and state and year fixed effects
Results The analytic sample included patient visits with reproductive age years individuals between
and Family planning services were provided at of total sampled visits and were more likely to be provided
in urban compared with rural areas adjusted odds ratio p and at community health centers compared with
private physician practices adjusted odds ratio p Family planning services were also more likely to be
provided when the patient saw a physician assistant or nurse compared with only a physician After controlling for
observed covariates measures of between clinician heterogeneity indicate wide variation in which clinicians provided
family planning services
Conclusions Family planning services were more likely to be provided in urban areas at community health centers and
when patients received team based care The wide variation between clinicians suggests a need to better incorporate
family planning services into primary care and other outpatient settings to meet patient needs and preferences

clinicians including family medicine physicians internal
medicine physicians and pediatricians can help to improve

Lee Parisi Akers Borrerro Schwarz Strasser Schenk

Despite these recommendations many clinicians do not
provide family planning services owing to challenges such as a
lack of knowledge or training limited time and support staff
misconceptions and bias which limit patient access Harper

et al
Several studies cite lack of training as a barrier
to contraception provision especially for intrauterine devices
IUDS and contraceptive implants However researchers have
also found that even when clinicians have the relevant
training they often still do not deliver evidence based family
planning services Greenberg Makino Coles Kang
et al Shoupe Thompson Broecker Dade
Available time and support staff also impact whether
family planning services are provided and these resources are
often limited in rural areas experiencing workforce shortages
McNeil Mitchell Parker Research has found that
rural populations face increased barriers to accessing care and
have limited access to comprehensive family planning services

can limit patients ability to make fully voluntary choices

For example clinicians may withhold information
about options available and or pressure patients to make
certain decisions either implicitly or explicitly Previous
research has also found that physician specialty age and
gender as well as county characteristics were associated with
contraceptive service provision to Medicaid beneficiaries

provision of family planning services aligns with other
research highlighting physician driven effects in health care
such as physician driven rates of cesarean sections Burns

Previous research has also examined how facility charac

and
availability of care to underserved and adolescent populations
Goldberg et al Mead et al However no studies
to our knowledge have simultaneously analyzed the associa
tion between facility and clinician characteristics and family
planning service provision while also stratifying by service
type
The objective of this study was two fold First we provided
descriptive statistics regarding the provision of family planning
services in outpatient care settings such as CHCs and private
physician practices excluding Planned Parenthood and Title X
clinics We aimed to better understand family planning services
that occur outside of family planning specialty settings because
primary care practices often face multiple challenges meeting
patients family planning needs amidst their many other con
cerns Biggs Kaller Harper Freedman Mays Second we
analyzed whether family planning service provision differed
based on facility and clinician characteristics using multilevel
modeling techniques to estimate the variation between indi
vidual clinicians In doing so we hope to provide valuable con
tributions to the literature on where and by whom family
planning services are provided in outpatient care settings This
knowledge will inform the larger discussion on the most effec
tive and equitable strategies to improve access to family plan
ning services In addition better understanding the role of
clinicians in family planning service provision can help to better
target resources and training so that patient needs and prefer
ences are met
Methods
Data
We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey NAMCS an annual national probability sample survey of
clinicians who are involved directly in office based ambulatory
i e outpatient care Observations were at the visit level and
sampled visits include those with physicians PAs nurse practi
tioners and nurse midwives Visits at Planned Parenthood Title
X clinics and hospital outpatient departments were not included
in the dataset NAMCS uses a standard clinician interview form
and automated tool to extract data from the patient record
which helps to minimize survey recall bias and missing infor
mation The annual survey is conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics of the CDC Methods used in the design
conduct and analysis of these surveys are fully described on the
NAMCS website where the data are also available National
Center for Health Statistics
We limited our sample to reproductive age years
individuals office visits between January and December
excluding because data were not collected and
made available that year Because of the COVID pandemic
is the most recent year where data were publicly available
NAMCS survey methodology includes a binary sex indicator all
visits in our sample were with patients who identified as female
at the time of data collection Our study sample ranges from
approximately to patient visits per year depending
on the year Given the deidentified nature of this public use
dataset analyses using NAMCS data are exempt from institu
tional review board approval

Analysis Variables
Our dependent variable was whether family planning ser
vices were provided at the visit We initially estimated models
based on whether any type of family planning service was pro
vided and then estimated models based on the specific type of
service provided For the purposes of our study we dis
aggregated family planning services into six categories contra
ceptive counseling contraceptive pill or shot IUD hormonal
implant sterilization and abortion These categories were
informed by NAMCS survey methodology and previous literature
Bello et al National Center for Health Statistics
Sarayani et al We used International Classification of
Diseases edition diagnosis and procedure codes medica
tions and reason for visit documented in the patient s record to
indicate if and what type of family planning service was pro
vided during the visit More than one type of family planning
service was provided in approximately of our sampled visits
e g contraceptive counseling and pill provided at the same
visit
Independent variables were facility location facility type
ownership type s of clinicians seen during the visit physi
cian specialty and whether the patient saw their primary care
provider PCP during the visit Facility location is urban if in a
Metropolitan Statistical Area and rural otherwise Types of
outpatient facilities in the sample include those owned by
private physician practices CHCs medical academic health
centers and insurance companies health plans or health
maintenance organizations NAMCS categorizes the following
types of facilities as CHCs FQHCs defined through the
Public Health Service Act that receive Section funding
FQHC look alikes or community based health care providers
that meet the requirements of the HRSA Health Center Pro
gram but do not receive Health Center Program funding and
urban Indian Health Service outpatient clinics We included
a categorical measure of team based care specifically types of
clinicians seen during the visit only a physician only a
PA or nurse physician and PA physician and nurse
physician and other clinician type nurse and other clinician
type and only other clinician type Nurses include nurse
practitioners registered nurses and licensed practical nurses
Other clinician types include mental health providers phar
macists and other allied health professionals If a physician
was seen during the visit categories of physician specialties
include general family practice obstetrics and gynecology
internal medicine pediatrics psychiatry and other specialty
e g cardiovascular health neurology Last we included a
binary variable indicating whether the patient saw their PCP
at the visit

chronic diseases that previous research has found could influ
ence use of family planning services specifically asthma chronic
heart failure hypertension diabetes obesity and depression

Sappenfield Robbins Hernandez We also include
state and year fixed effects
Statistical Analyses
For basic characterization of both outcome and predictor
variables we conducted descriptive statistical analyses for our
total sample of visits and visits where family planning services
were provided stratifying by specific type of service provided
Next we used multilevel random intercept logistic regression to
estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the relationship between
facility and clinician characteristics and provision of family
planning services Our models included clinician level random
intercepts e g clustered by specific clinician identifier and
therefore allow for nonindependence of the outcomes for
different patients treated by the same clinician given the cova
riates In addition random intercept models allowed us to
differentiate the residual variation in the outcome explained by
clinician level factors Specifically the random intercept residual
variance allowed us to quantify the impact of clinician level
factors not measured by covariates on family planning service
provision Maximum likelihood estimation with adaptive quad
rature was used to estimate the model parameters We also used
robust standard errors clustered at the clinician level using a
Huber White sandwich estimator
Across our models we reported measures of clinician level
heterogeneity controlling for covariates namely the residual
standard deviation intraclass correlation ICC and median odds
ratio MOR Residual standard deviation is a measure of the
variability at the clinician level Rabe Hesketh Skrondal
The ICC measures between clinician heterogeneity or within
clinician homogeneity and is interpreted in terms of the latent
response for logistic regression models Hedeker
Previ
ous studies have also used ICC as an indicator of reliability with a
higher ICC indicating higher reliability of estimates Rodriguez
et al
The MOR is a measure of heterogeneity between
clinicians after controlling for other covariates It is the median
value of the odds ratios when comparing the odds of family
planning service provision for a patient from one randomly
selected clinician cluster with another patient that has identical
covariates but is randomly selected from a different clinician
cluster The MOR can be conceptualized as the increased likeli
hood of family planning provision in median from seeing a
different randomly selected clinician who was otherwise iden
tical in terms of observed covariates Merlo et al
All hypothesis tests reported are based on two sided p values
We considered p values of less than to be statistically sig
nificant Data management and analysis were conducted using

Our measures of between clinician heterogeneity indicate a
high amount of variation in which clinicians provided family
planning services The ICC was meaning that of the
variation in our outcome family planning service provision for
the latent response was due to clinician level factors not
captured by the observed covariates in our model For compar
ison a systematic review analyzing between clinician variation
for different health care outcomes estimated an ICC of to
for clinician activity use i e ordering prescriptions laboratory
tests to for diabetes care and outcomes and up to
for patient satisfaction with PCPs Fung et al Researchers
have also theorized that a high ICC meaning high variability
between individual clinicians indicates high potential for qual
ity improvement at the clinician level Berwick The esti
mated MOR was meaning if two clinicians in our dataset
identical in terms of observed covariates were randomly
selected one would have a times higher median odds of
providing family planning services compared with the other
Overall these measures of between clinician heterogeneity
indicate that specific clinicians were much more likely to provide
family planning care compared with others after controlling for
observed covariates

Sensitivity Analyses
In our first sensitivity analysis we estimated the measures of
between clinician heterogeneity for specific types of family
planning services see bottom of Table The ICC ranges from
for IUD visits to for counseling visits and the MOR
follows a similar pattern We also estimated the ICC for common
facility ownership types and found the ICC was for private
physician practices and for CHCs Overall measures of be
tween clinician heterogeneity were relatively consistent even
when stratifying by type of family planning service and facility
type This further supports the hypothesis that certain clinicians
were much more likely to provide family planning services
compared with others
In our second sensitivity analysis we estimated random
intercept regression models during specific years Although the
survey is designed to be nationally representative every year the
NAMCS has used slightly different survey and sampling designs
over to so we wanted to ensure the robustness of our
regression results across years In Appendix Table A l we present
adjusted odds ratios for any type of family planning service being
provided These estimates indicate that our results are qualita
tively similar over the study period Owing to changes in sam
pling design and weighting schema we are not able to estimate
how the overall prevalence of family planning service provision
has changed in our sample between the years and

Discussion
This study analyzed the association between facility and
clinician characteristics and family planning services provided
during outpatient care visits in the United States We aimed to
better understand family planning services that occur in primary
care outpatient settings such as CHCs and private physician
practices rather than family planning specialty settings e g
Planned Parenthood and Title X clinics By clustering our results
at the clinician level we were able to quantify the variation be
tween specific clinicians in the odds of family planning service
provision To our knowledge this study is the first to empirically
investigate the role of facility and clinician characteristics on the
likelihood of family planning service provision using a large
nationally representative dataset and multilevel modeling
techniques The use of a large national dataset makes our find
ings broadly generalizable to the outpatient care setting
We find that any type of family planning service was provided
at of the total sampled visits Contraceptive counseling was
provided most commonly other family planning services were
not provided very often We also find that family planning ser
vices were more likely to be provided in urban areas at CHCs
and when patients received team based care Our results indi
cate that some clinicians were much more likely than others to
provide family planning services after controlling for observed
covariates which is consistent with other literature highlighting
clinician influence on health care use Flynn Smith Davis
Fred Fung et al This finding suggests that
diverse clinician beliefs and practices may influence what and if
family planning services are provided to patients

This study has several limitations Our data source NAMCS
does not include several variables such as patient sexual ac
tivity sexual orientation pregnancy desires or physician age
gender and race ethnicity that may influence our observed
outcomes Another limitation is that we were unable to ascertain
patient preferences or disentangle selection effects regarding
family planning service provision We would expect some vari
ation between clinicians owing to factors such as patient selec
tion and clinician experience and training However the
measures of between clinician heterogeneity in our study are
high relative to measures of between clinician heterogeneity for
other health care processes and outcomes in the literature Fung
et al
Future research should further explore these se
lection effects to better understand the causal impact of facility
and clinician characteristics on family planning service
provision
Implications for Policy and or Practice
Ensuring access to comprehensive patient centered family
planning services is a key strategy in advancing reproductive
autonomy Our results suggest that more work may be needed to
ensure clinicians are willing and able to provide family planning
care as recommended by the CDC and several professional
medical societies Studies have found that training and support
for patient centered counseling may be an effective approach to
increase access to comprehensive family planning services and
support reproductive agency Dehlendorf Grumbach
Schmittdiel Steinauer Harper et al Stulberg
Broader facility level system changes may also be
et al
needed to address barriers so that PCPs are able to incorporate
family planning services when appropriate and desired by pa
tients These changes may include expanded referral networks
modifications in team based care processes such as nonphysi
cian clinicians providing family planning services in some cases
billing and payment incentives and or patient engagement and
education tools In addition policy changes related to over the
counter contraception telehealth regulation and scope of prac
tice laws may decrease barriers to access
Conclusions
Our findings inform the broader discussion on the most
effective and equitable strategies to improve access to family
planning services Understanding the role of facility and clinician
characteristics in service provision can help to better target re
sources and training so that patient needs and desires are met
Given that primary care is the principal source of health care for
many pregnancy capable people increasing the proportion of
clinicians who offer patient centered contraceptive counseling
in primary care settings is key to improving access and outcomes
On June the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs
v Jackson Women s Health Organization no longer acknowledging
the constitutional right to an abortion
National Constitution
Abortion access has been further restricted in
Center
the wake of this ruling highlighting a need to integrate family
planning services in particular contraceptive counseling to
ensure patient reproductive needs and desires are met Future
work should focus on understanding barriers and developing
interventions to incorporate recommended family planning
services into primary care and other appropriate outpatient
settings

Information on specific risks among pregnant women are urgently needed to provide evidence based guide
lines for the management of this vulnerable population To accomplish this we developed an international web
in March to promote a structured collection of data regarding pregnant women and their fetuses
exposed to SARS CoV Using this dataset we performed a case control study to assess the risk of severe mater
nal outcomes and associated risk factors as well as a description of pregnancy neonatal outcomes stratified for
the severity of the disease among pregnant women with a confirmed SARS CoV infection
Materials and methods
Study setting and population The patients enrolled in this study are part of the COVI Preg international
registry investigating the consequences of SARS Cov infection during All pregnant women tested
for SARS CoV infection at any stage of gestation were eligible for inclusion in this multicenter study except
those years of age as well as individuals declining to consent or not able to consent for themselves Informed
oral or written consent was obtained for all participants Deidentified data were prospectively recorded by each
center Table Sl using the REDCap Research Electronic Data Capture electronic data capture uality
checks were performed as described in the Supplementary Materials Using this dataset we performed a case
control study among pregnant women with a confirmed SARS CoV infection
The study was approved by both the Swiss Ethical Board CER VD and the local ethics boards
at each participating center The study was conducted from March to July All methods were
carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations in the manuscript
Inclusion criteria and SARS CoV status Pregnant women were tested for SARS CoV either
because of a suspected infection due to ongoing symptoms compatible with COVID or an history of potential
exposure or through routine systematic screening instituted during the pandemic in some hospitals depending
on local capacities and guidelines Maternal testing was performed using a nasopharyngeal RT PCR for SARS
COV swab test Pregnant women with a positive RT PCR test result at any stage during pregnancy irrespective
of clinical signs and symptoms were considered as having a confirmed infection and included in the present
study Pregnant women with a SARS CoV negative test and no other positive test result during the entire
follow up period were excluded

Discussion
In this study we present the largest cohort of pregnant women tested for SARS Cov worldwide and the first
analysis of primary data stratified by the severity of maternal disease allowing us to identify specific risk factors
associated with adverse maternal outcomes
Severe adverse outcomes defined by maternal death admission to ICU and or advanced oxygen support
were observed in of cases Pulmonary comorbidities hypertensive disorders and diabetes mellitus were
significantly associated with an increased risk of severe maternal outcomes while usual pregnancy related risk
factors were not No difference in the livebirth rate was observed between pregnant women with severe adverse
outcomes and patients with an uncomplicated course Nevertheless a significant increased risk of caesarean sec
tion preterm birth and neonatal admission to the intensive care unit was observed highlighting that obstetrical
and neonatal outcomes are influenced by the severity of maternal disease
The rate of severe disease observed here is similar to what has been previously reported in other large
and summarized in a recent meta where the risk of severe disease among pregnant women
with COVID was estimated to be CI Importantly this risk of severe maternal complica
tions appears significantly higher when compared to a non pregnant population at an equivalent age with an
increased odds of ICU admission or mechanical ventilation up to CI and CI
Risk factors for severe maternal disease appear to be similar to what has been previously described in the
general population namely pulmonary pathologies hypertension and Congruently in their meta
analysis Allotey et al observed an increased risk of severe disease among pregnant women y o those with
chronic hypertension pre existing diabetes or body mass index Interestingly in our study after adjust
ment obesity was not independently associated with an increased risk of severe adverse outcomes This could be
explained by the fact that overweight patients often suffer from hypertension and diabetes metabolic syndrome
which could act as the predominant causal factors Both are associated with macro and micro vascular com
plications and endothelial dysfunction has been suggested as a major pathophysiological mechanism associ
ated with COVID severity In pregnancy endothelial change is a well known mechanism of obstetrical
complications such as gestational hypertension HELLP Hemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelets and
pre and may contribute to the increased risk of COVID complications In our study we did
not observe any association with maternal age This could be explained by the low number of patients Y O
included Similarly ethnicity non Caucasian versus Caucasian was not associated with poorer outcomes unlike
previously
We observed a rate of positive test among newborns born to mothers with a positive SARS CoV test
The clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear as at the time of the study we were lacking comprehensive
data regarding COVID related symptoms or COVID suspected symptoms among newborns repeated testing
and long term follow up Perinatal transmission of SARS CoV has been reported by others both in case of
vaginal and cesarean sections and was associated in some cases with neonatal symptoms
In all reported
cases the possibility of postnatal infection through contacts with parents or medical personal remains diffcult

to excludel Alternatively transplacental transmission has been suspected in few cases where specific IgM
were detected among newborns Nevertheless perinatal vertical transmission appear to be rare and mainly
associated with good neonatal outcomes
Our study has several limitations First we present here the outcomes among pregnant women with a con
firmed SARS CoV infection and therefore only observational conclusions can be drawn regarding the absolute
risks of severe disease and adverse obstetrical neonatal outcomes as a control group of negative patients was not
included Nevertheless this was beyond the scope of the present study whose first aim was to identify specific
risk factors
Second heterogeneities exist between participating centers in the testing of pregnant women While some
centers performed routine systematic screening of presenting women independently of compatible symptoms
other only tested symptomatic pregnant women This could have led to a selections bias of more severe sympto
matic COVID cases Ifa symptomatic SARS CoV infection is associated with poorer maternal obstetrical
and neonatal outcomes this selection bias may have resulted in an overestimation of the absolute risk of adverse
outcomes However the rate of asymptomatic infections among included positive women of n
is quite similar to the rate of asymptomatic infection described in the general population estimated to range
around and suggests a low impact of this potential bias Similarly patients admitted with severe
disease were very likely systematically tested for SARS CoV which may have led to a possible overestimation
of the actual rate of severe adverse outcome among positive patients Follow up analysis including patients with
ongoing pregnancies with an uncomplicated course based on systematic screening will help assess the exact risk
in a more general population of pregnant women
Third most patients were included during the trimester of gestation with the majority included close
to delivery while pregnancies were still ongoing at the time of analysis Although we did not observe any
impact of the gestational age i e WG on the severity of maternal disease this could be related to a lack
of statistical power Pregnancy related vascular complications only occur after WG which would suggest
an increased risk of maternal complications in cases of maternal infection at a later stage of the pregnancy as
observed by In our cohort severe maternal outcomes were also observed in women exposed at WG
with an overall similar risk n to what was described in the whole cohort Therefore caution should
also be taken with pregnant women infected in early pregnancy
Although our data regarding obstetrical outcomes are reassuring definite conclusions cannot be drawn
Infections occurring at an earlier stage of gestation may be associated with poorer obstetrical outcomes Viral
particles have been detected within the placentas of women infected earlier during pregnancy
Although
placental infection seems rare it has been associated with evidence of malperfusion
which is known to be
associated with reduced fetal growth and intra uterine fetal death Of note Khalil et al have shown an increase in
the number of stillbirths during the epidemic peak without being able to determine whether this is a direct effect
of the At the time of analysis pregnancies WG that were exposed during the and trimesters
were still ongoing Fig suggesting an uncomplicated course Subsequent analysis including those patients
are needed to better define obstetrical and neonatal outcomes
In conclusion pregnant women particularly those with associated comorbidities seem to be at higher risk
of severe complications of SARS CoV infection Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes appear to be influenced
by the severity of maternal disease complications include caesarean sections neonatal prematurity and neonatal
admission to the intensive care unit Further studies are needed to assess maternal and neonatal outcomes for
cases of earlier exposure

Abstract Perception and knowledge of risk factors for pregnancy influence health behaviors during
pregnancy and childbirth We used a descriptive qualitative study to examine the perception and
knowledge of risk factors in pregnancy and childbirth in low income urban women in Ghana Over
the course of three months focus group discussions and six individual interviews were conducted
with participants selected from six communities in the study area Data were analyzed using
inductive thematic content analysis Findings revealed that participants had knowledge of some risk
factors although some had superstitious beliefs Participants viewed pregnancy as an exciting and
unique experience but also challenging with a host of medical and psychological risks Pre existing
medical conditions e g diabetes lack of physical activity poverty poor nutrition and lack of social
support were identified as conditions that could lead to negative pregnancy outcomes Superstitious
beliefs such as exposure to evil eye during pregnancy as well as curses and spells were also
identified as risk factors for pregnancy complications This research has implications for policies and
programs to improve pregnancy outcomes for low income women in Ghana Thus we recommend
social and economic support programs as well as health education to change misperceptions about
pregnancy risk and to support other efforts being made to improve maternal health outcomes
Keywords perception knowledge risk in pregnancy women low income communities
Introduction
Risk is defined as a factor that presents eminent danger or increases the probability
of experiencing adverse outcomes Perception on the other hand refers to a mental
image or subjective ideas about a potential occurrence of a phenomenon The concept
of perception is important because it is a driver of health seeking behavior and the man
agement of health outcomes Risk perception therefore refers to risk interpretations
or understanding as well as subjective judgements about risk In the field of health
risk perception denotes subjective judgements about the likelihood of negative or adverse
outcomes of conditions such as illnesses injuries diseases or death Perceptions and
knowledge about risk are important determinants of health behaviors and risk related
decision making such as whether to adopt or not to adopt healthy behaviors and reject or
accept a certain level of health risks
Risk perception has two dimensions the cognitive aspect which relates to how much
individuals know and understand risks and the emotional aspect which relates to how
people feel about themselves and a potential risk Research on risk perception often
begins with the presumption that how people feel about danger is determined by the level
of knowledge and certainty they have regarding that risk This idea is founded on the
rational choice model of decision making which presents individuals as rational beings
who evaluate the possibilities of health outcomes after first estimating the prospective costs
and benefits On the other hand laypersons usually assess risk by using heuristics for

Women
example previous experiences and other informal ways of thinking This means that
when people are aware of certain risks or potential risks they tend to believe that those
risks could happen more frequently than the risks actually occur and vice versa These risk
misinterpretations rooted in heuristics can cause people to overestimate or underestimate
the occurrence and severity of potential health threats
According to Lennon risk perception in pregnancy entails both the objective
medical evaluation of risk as well as a subjective socially constructed risk guided by a
complex web of personal psychological and cultural factors It includes the assessment of
the possibility of harm or negative health outcomes to either the mother or the newborn
or both However sometimes this harm or risk is not related to a particular medical
condition instead women may see pregnancy and childbirth as inherent risks rather
than conditions that cause the risk In recent years risk perception and the way risks are
construed in pregnancy have received a lot of scholarly attention This can be explained
in part by the growing prevalence of a medicalized perspective on pregnancy and the
social pressure placed on women to behave in a way that lessens the perceived risks
Increasingly medical interventions are seen as both necessary and desirable for successful
pregnancies as the state of pregnancy has become more and more medicalized Thus
seeking preventive services such as antenatal screening genetic screening and testing as
well as health behavior modifications are considered necessary to reduce any potential risk
of pregnancy complications
Furthermore considerable evidence shows that perceptions and understanding or
knowledge of risk are shaped by many factors including socio cultural background
levels of literacy and religious or traditional beliefs An individual s knowledge
and interpretation of risk is also dependent on their personal life philosophy and previous
experience It has been documented that sometimes women perceive risk in relation to
pregnancy from the social perspective where risk is seen as being influenced by the social
cultural and political milieu in which they reside Wheeler and colleagues for
example reported women s employment experience during pregnancy as an important
factor in determining their perception of risk in pregnancy Furthermore other scholars
have reported that maternal age personal and family history knowledge about
pregnancy and childbirth as well as level of risk or complication in pregnancy
are important determinants of perception and understanding of risk in pregnancy These
factors can influence opinions interpretations of and values put on the risks and even
benefits associated with pregnancy In a qualitative study on pregnancy risk perception
and preterm birth Silva and colleagues found that personal negative experiences in
previous pregnancies such as stillbirths miscarriages having a preterm birth or neonatal
death informed risk perceptions of the current pregnancy Women s perception of risk in
pregnancy has also been attributed to their knowledge base of risk
Perception and understanding of risk in pregnancy have the effect of influencing
various critical pregnancy and childbirth decisions They affect decisions such as when
and where to seek antenatal care where to give birth or choice of maternity site who
supervises the birth and even the mode of delivery Silva and colleagues also
argued that a patient s risk perception of health guides his or her decisions on treatment
and can further influence health seeking behavior during serious conditions such as pre
term births one of the most critical potential risks faced during pregnancy Janson on
childbirth decisions and traditional structures in Ghana explained that women who viewed
childbirth as a natural process and without potential risks or ill health may consider home
delivery as the best option Traditionally in Ghanaian society pregnancy and childbirth
are viewed as a vulnerability and potentially dangerous experiences that do not only
require biomedical care but also spiritual intervention Therefore many women seek a
combination of care biomedical care traditional care which involves the use of herbal
medicine and spiritual support faith healing and prayer in the pregnancy period with
the hope of averting any perceived or actual health risk to the pregnancy and during
childbirth The focus of this paper therefore is to present findings from a study
Women
that investigated women s perception and knowledge of risk in pregnancy and childbirth
and how these affect their maternal healthcare seeking behavior in selected low income
communities in Accra The implications of the findings for maternal and newborn health
policies and programs are discussed
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This was a descriptive qualitative study that targeted women in selected low income
communities in Accra Ghana The data were gathered over a three month period through
focus group discussions FGDs and interviews to examine women s perception and knowl
edge about risk in pregnancy and childbirth
Study Area
The study was conducted in the Ashiedu Keteke sub metropolitan district in the city
of Accra Ghana s capital Ashiedu Keteke is one of the sub metropolitan districts of
Accra Metropolitan City and has some of the poorest communities in the city Using the
Greater Accra region population growth of the sub metropolis has an estimated
population of about in The sub metropolis has the Central Business
District CBD and it is the center of major commercial activities within the city of Accra
with an influx of approximately million people from all parts of the country daily As
the center of commerce it houses the Markola and Agbogbloshie markets which are two
major markets within the Greater Accra region The population of Ashiedu Keteke is made
up of the indigenous Ga people who live in the coastal communities along the Gulf of
Guinea the Atlantic Ocean and other migrant populations who reside a bit further away
from the coast The main occupation of the indigenous Ga people is fishing the men do the
fishing and the women smoke the fish for the market The migrant population engages in
small scale commercial activities mostly trading
In terms of health care the Ussher Polyclinic the Prince Marie Louise Children s
Hospital and the James Town Maternity are among the major health facilities that provide
care to residents in the sub metropolitan district Maternal health continues to be a health
challenge as Ashiedu Keteke has one of the poorest maternal health outcomes in Accra and
has a persistently high teenage pregnancy rate in the city There is high prevalence
of the use of informal maternal health care traditional birth attendance faith healing and
prayer by pregnant women in the area especially among the teenage and indigenous
mothers From available data about of pregnant women who reside in the sub
metropolitan district do not seek antenatal care until the second and third trimesters a
situation quite a bit higher than the national average of
Sampling of Participants and Data Collection
Purposive sampling was utilized to select six communities within the study area for
the FGDs and individual interviews Altogether women between the ages of and
years were recruited for focus group discussions and six individuals were involved
in the interviews For the FGDs a snowball sampling approach was employed to recruit
women who had at least one child We conducted two FGDs in each of the communities
We divided the women in the FGDs into two age cohorts those aged to and those aged
to Each FGD had an average of seven participants and lasted between min We
conducted six FGDs with each age cohort Additionally six women with at least one child
from each of the six communities one mother from each community were interviewed for
about min to elicit in depth perspectives on the subject matter Two community leaders
assisted with the recruitment of the study participants
The FGDs and individual interviews both used comparable questions which were
framed around our research objectives We asked participants about their knowledge and
risk perceptions with regard to pregnancy and childbirth and how these factors influenced
their healthcare seeking decisions and behaviors during pregnancy and childbirth Both
Women
FGDs and interviews were carried out with the assistance of our two fieldworkers and in
two local languages spoken in the study area The two field assistants were native speakers
of the two local languages Ga and Twi The FGDs and interviews were audio recorded
with the participants permission
Ethical Consideration
The Human Subject Review Committee of the University of Massachusetts Amherst
School of Public Health granted the ethical approval of the research Additionally we
received authorization from the local health administration in the study area and verbal
consent from all study participants prior to their enrollment in the study Since most of our
study participants had only a basic formal education we only sought verbal consent from
them prior to recruitment into the study and assured them that information obtained from
the FGDs and interviews would be kept confidential and only the lead researcher would
have access to the raw data Participation in the study was voluntary and they had the
option of withdrawing at any time
Data Analysis
The data analysis began during the data collection phase and continued following
FGDs and interview sessions With the assistance of our two fieldworkers audio recordings
of both FGDs and interviews were transcribed from the local languages into English
Following transcription we cross checked the transcripts to confirm that the responses
had been accurately transcribed and translated from the local languages to English We
reviewed the final transcripts in order to determine which words phrases and statements
were pertinent to our primary research questions and objectives We classified the data
into nine themes using an inductive content analysis approach proposed by Corbin and
Strauss and Miles and colleagues
We first identified and cataloged the major concepts and recurring ideas in each
interview transcript Second we compared and classified the significant concepts and
emerging themes from the interview transcripts We did the same thing with the transcript
data from the FGDs we compared significant concepts and developing themes within and
across FGDs The raw text section containing the essential concepts and ideas were coded
manually and classified according to the emergent themes To ensure the findings internal
validity we compared and contrasted data segments from the FGDs with the individual
interviews
In this article we present data on nine themes that emerged from our
analysis
Results
The nine themes were identified as the following factors first trimester experience
medical conditions lack of physical activity antenatal care lack of social support poverty
and poor nutrition sleeping posture and hot showers exposure to certain conditions and
spells and curses
First Trimester Experience
According to most of the participants pregnancy during the first trimester period
is associated with both joy and risk The participants reported that the usual thought of
being pregnant brings joy and hope but the experience during this period could be
challenging for many women Participants explained that during the first trimester the
pregnant woman is unable to eat as she experiences general body weakness morning sick
ness fevers severe headaches dizziness heart palpitations and sleeplessness Although
these are normal they could pose serious health risks to the woman during this period
of the pregnancy The women described psychological problems such as fears anxiety
and stress that a woman could experience during early months of the pregnancy Two
participants explained it this way
Women
When a woman is pregnant she does not feel well as she used to be the whole
experience can make you feel sick and you know this feeling of sickness can last
during the whole pregnancy period for many women the first three months can
be hard on you you become anxious and afraid
FGD participant
In my case I always felt like I was going to fall down in my early months But
this feeling happens to many pregnant women so its normal to feel that way
because your body is adjusting it begins to go away after the third months for
most pregnant women Interview participant
Medical Conditions
Both FGD and interview participants were of the view that complications could occur
in pregnancy when a pregnant woman already has a pre existing disease They explained
that pre existing diseases or infections such as malaria diabetes candidiasis odeepu
or HIV can increase the vulnerability of a pregnant woman This is because it is not easy
to carry a pregnancy when you are already sick or have a disease Interview participant
Having a chronic condition
like AIDS or sugar disease diabetes and becoming
pregnant could be challenging as you don t sit at home You will need to go to the clinic
for regular and proper care FGD participant These medical conditions could expose
the woman to the risk of experiencing a difficult pregnancy labor and delivery and could
affect the baby s health as well
According to the participants in the FGDs other medical conditions indicating that the
pregnant woman is at risk of complications are high blood pressure swelling in the hands
and feet anemia and delay in the delivery of the afterbirth or the placenta Participants
also mentioned bleeding during pregnancy and childbirth as a major health risk for the
mother and the baby These views were also expressed by the women in the individual
interviews as exemplified by a personal experience of an interview participant who said
I don t have an easy pregnancy My second pregnancy was the worst of all I
had swollen feet and hands and they nurses said my blood pressure was going
up at some point and I thought those were not good signs for my pregnancy
especially when they told me my pressure was going high and I had to come in
for regular review Interview participant
Lack of Physical Activity
Another risk factor identified was being physically inactive during pregnancy Ac
cording to some of the participants a pregnant woman who is physically inactive or does
not exercise could likewise be at risk for a difficult and prolonged labor as explained in the
following statement by an FGD participant
You see there are pregnant women who don t do any work they don t walk
they just sit at one place and they stop coming to the market But there are others
who work with their pregnancy They go to the farm and do everything When
you are not active the baby will not be active The baby cannot turn or move in
the womb and you will have problem during delivery
FGD participant
Antenatal Care
Most of the participants said women who do not seek medical care or attend ante
natal clinics could be at risk of pregnancy complications During the FGDs participants
recounted that a pregnant woman should seek regular health care to prevent potential
complications that could affect the pregnancy and to ensure a successful birth A participant
in the FGDs noted a situation where the mother failed to seek antenatal screening for
early risk detection and treatment it leads to conditions such as fetal malpresentation or
malposition a critical condition for prolonged labor FGD participant
Women
Similar views were also shared by participants in the interviews who identified
prolonged labor as a risk a pregnant woman could be exposed to during childbirth if she
fails to attend an antenatal clinic
Lack of Social Support
According to the participants pregnant women who do not have adequate spousal
or family support could experience difficult pregnancy and childbirth because pregnancy
could be stressful and emotionally demanding As a result if the pregnant woman is
not adequately supported it could negatively affect her health and that of the unborn
baby Two FGD participants explained the effect of a lack of social support on pregnancy
outcomes in the quotation below
I know a young woman that the man who made her pregnant refused to accept
the pregnancy Her parents are not living here referring to her community and
she does not have any other family member in Accra here The baby she delivered
was very small You know she didn t have any support she was always by
herself and only got a little help from neighbors and that affected the baby FGD
participant
Sometimes these young mothers work long hours The kayaye teen girls head
porters who are pregnant they carry heavy loads in the market for people
who come to shop or do groceries They don t have their families or anybody
here to help them It is stressful to do this kind of job when you are pregnant
FGD participants
These findings were corroborated by the interview participants who reported a lack
of social support for young migrant pregnant women in the study area as a major risk
factor for negative pregnancy outcomes The following remark was made by a participant
in support of this assertion when you go to the market right now you see them young
female migrant porters carrying big bowls full of load for people with their pregnancy
Some of them don t even know the fathers of their babies and their parents are not here to
help them and this is not good for the pregnancy Interview participant
Poverty and Poor Nutrition
Poverty emerged as an important risk factor for pregnancy and childbirth compli
cations Both FGDs and interview participants agreed that poverty could lead to poor
nutrition among pregnant women leading to poor pregnancy outcomes because a preg
nant woman should ensure she eats well on time and the right portions which is a major
problem for some women According to the participants some pregnant women don t
have the money to buy enough food and that could affect their health and the pregnancy
as well A pregnant participant in one of the FGDs confirmed this and said the poor
mothers who don t have families here their general health begins to become worse after
delivery This is because when they go home there is nothing there to eat and their babies
cannot grow because they don t feed them well since they themselves don t eat well FGD
Participant According to some participants the young pregnant migrant mothers who
lived in the study area relied on neighbors for meals when they became pregnant One
FGD participant also put it this way
if they don t get this assistance they don t eat Some pregnant mothers eat
small portions of meal in the morning and they don t eat until evening because
they don t have families here Accra and the men who made them pregnant
didn t accept the pregnancy FGD participant
These findings were supported by some of the interview participants who said that
the young pregnant migrant mothers usually worked for long hours carrying heavy loads
to make a living and to save towards delivery which exposes them to pregnancy related
risks The quotation below highlights this issue
Women
Oh when you go there markets right now you will see them working in the
market they carry loads in the market Some sell under the hot sun and this is
not too good for the pregnancy but they need the money so they and their babies
can have food to eat the weeks following delivery Interview participant
Furthermore most of the participants thought that poverty made it difficult for preg
nant mothers to attend antenatal clinics and delayed care during labor exposing the
pregnant woman and the baby to life threatening complications
Sleeping Posture and Hot Showers
Both the FGDs and interview participants agreed that when a pregnant mother sleeps
on her back it can affect the health of the mother and the unborn baby They explained that
when a pregnant mother sleeps on her back it obstructs the flow of oxygen from the mother
to the unborn baby and this could be fatal for the unborn baby as well as the mother
This sleeping on your back during pregnancy is not good for your pregnancy
when you are pregnant you don t sleep on your back You sleep by your side
People pregnant women who sleep on their back can hurt their baby the baby
cannot breath because air will not flow from you the mother to your baby so
they tell us not to sleep on our back They are not good practice for the baby so
you can kill your baby because the baby cannot get air from your when you sleep
on your back
FGD participants
Some participants also reported that taking hot water showers and baths could nega
tively affect the pregnancy Two participants explained
they say bathing with hot water is not good warm water is okay hot
water is not good for the baby too It can make the baby temperature go up
Interview participant
Bathing with hot water can make you the mother feel hot and you can pass
heat on to the baby in your womb so you don t take hot showers when you are
pregnant FGD participants
Exposure to Certain Conditions
One major perceived risk in pregnancy mentioned by the participants is the exposure
of the unborn baby to conditions that can cause the child to acquire certain health defects
such as cerebral palsy called asram in the local language This often happens if the
pregnant woman does not take very good care of herself and her pregnancy For example
if the pregnant woman does not dress well she could expose herself and her pregnancy
unborn baby to individuals with such conditions This is based on the belief that cerebral
palsy is transferrable spiritually from a person who has the condition to the mother and
then to the baby to be born Asram is a spiritual disease that can be passed on through
eye contact when a pregnant mother comes into contact with an individual who spreads the
disease One interview participant elaborated on this perception in the following quotation
For a disease like asram when you are pregnant you don t have to eat everywhere
When some people see the pregnancy they can transfer the disease to the unborn baby
You have to dress decently so that you don t expose yourself and your pregnancy
Some people dress exposing their body when they are pregnant
So when you
dress like that and you come across someone with the disease that individual can
transfer the disease to the baby Interview participant
Some participants also reported that cerebral palsy can kill and that it can only be
treated with traditional or herbal medicine For example during the FGDs one mother
recounted her experience with asram it asram affected me and my baby and I was
taken to a certain woman for herbal treatment for almost a year before my baby was
FGD participant
Women
Spells and Curses
Participants also narrated that a woman can be at risk of pregnancy complications
and or even death if she is cursed during pregnancy According to most FGD participants
when a pregnant woman is disrespectful or often picks quarrels with neighbors a curse
could be cast on her and this may lead to stillbirth and death during childbirth This view
was confirmed by a participant in the interviews in the following remarks
do you know that evil people can harm your pregnancy They can cast a curse
spell on you and your unborn baby so the young pregnant women here who like
quarreling and fighting some ended up having a difficulty childbirth Interview
participant
This finding was supported by other participants who spoke of some young pregnant
mothers visiting spiritual churches to seek protection for fear the effects of curses by people
they might have wronged
They young pregnant mothers go the spiritual churches to pray for successful
pregnancy because they are afraid somebody that they have quarreled with or
disrespected might have cursed them and the pregnancy FGD participants
Discussion
Although the findings from this study do not represent the views of all Ghanaian
women they provide some insight into the general perception and knowledge of risk
factors for negative pregnancy and childbirth outcomes among women in Ghana The
findings indicated that participants view pregnancy as an exciting and unique experience
however they acknowledged the risks both medical and spiritual associated with it This
perception of risk could serve as a motivation for women to adopt positive health seeking
behaviors such as attending antenatal clinics exercising and eating good food during
pregnancy However this perception of risk can also induce serious emotional experiences
such as fear anxiety and stress that will require both informal and professional support
On the contrary it seems that some women in the study area were not adequately receiving
this support during pregnancy This might be one of the reasons why maternal health
outcomes in the study area are reported to be poor The findings of the study are
consistent with previous studies where women were found to hold such perceptions of
risks Anxiety and fear due to perceived risks in pregnancy and childbirth such
as prolonged and painful labor lack of social support as well as economic uncertainty
leading to stress were identified among women in studies by Erickson et al Lyberg
and Severinson and Saisto and Halmesmaki Thus pregnancy risk perceptions
among pregnant women can affect their health and health care decisions and treatment
options
The findings that women perceived a lack of social support as a risk factor for preg
nancy is relevant As confirmed by previous studies people with a high quality or quantity
of social networks and economic stability have a decreased risk of mortality in comparison
with those who have a low quality or quantity of social network engagement and are eco
nomically unstable In pregnancy in particular Hotelling and colleagues found
that women with continuous support either emotionally or socially were less likely to have
complications in pregnancy that could lead to Caesarean deliveries than those without any
support Likewise evidence from Ghana indicated that lack of support from friends and
extended family being abandoned by one s husband and being compelled to live with
unfriendly in laws are risk factors that could expose pregnant women to psychological
problems during pregnancy
Several studies have illustrated that poor women are at higher risk of food insuf
ficiency insecurity and poor feeding practices leading to malnutrition and maternal
morbidity Poverty hinders access to sufficient and nutritious food and at the
same time acts as a barrier to accessing quality and timely maternal health care
In Kenya for example Izugbara and Ngilangwa found that poverty compelled
Women
pregnant women in slums to engage in tedious work for long hours in order to save
enough money for delivery risking their lives Women in our study shared similar views
regarding young migrant pregnant women who carry heavy loads and work longer
hours for a living and in preparation for delivery
The findings showed that participants had knowledge of some common medical
risks associated with negative pregnancy outcomes in Ghana In Ghana like many other
tropical countries malaria is endemic and it is known to be a major contributing factor to
stillbirths Medical conditions such as diabetes candidiasis high blood pressure
HIV anemia and delayed placenta as well as lack of physical activity are also risk factors
that were identified as dangers to pregnancy and childbirth These findings are consistent
with a study conducted in Kenya where participants identified similar conditions as threats
to positive pregnancy outcomes
Our participants had a strong belief in religious spiritual factors such as curses as
risk factors in pregnancy These beliefs are rooted in the community and are not only
widespread among Ghanaians but also exist in many cultures in sub Saharan Africa This
belief has an influence on health care choices and decisions during pregnancy and childbirth
and motivates most women to resort to herbal medicine spiritual care faith healing and
prayer or a combination of medical and traditional treatments during pregnancy
In rural Zimbabwe for example it has been discovered that women fear being bewitched
because they are thought to be vulnerable to witchcraft in the early months of pregnancy
As such they preferred to seek protection from faith healers who are believed to possess
supernatural powers to protect them and their pregnancy Similar findings have also
been observed in studies in Southern America and indigenous Pilipino in Southeast
Asia Interestingly this notion according to the authors is parallel to the biomedical
perspective which describes the early months of pregnancy as the most critical period
Unlike in many western cultures women in Ghana fully cover their pregnancy during the
entire pregnancy period This practice is believed to protect the pregnancy from a curse
spell or witchcraft
Implications
As governments are making efforts to address the challenges of poor maternal health
outcomes the need for research that has practical applications is essential Our findings
revealed many issues that are relevant for maternal and child healthcare policies and
programs for low income women in Ghana First the findings suggest that many pregnant
women go through psychological issues during pregnancy due to the perceived risks
associated with it Although medical interventions such as antenatal care are important
during pregnancy psychological support is equally important Pregnancy induces physical
and emotional change and increases the risk of mental illness Psychological support
for women during pregnancy is therefore very important for positive outcomes The
Ministry of Health in consultation with other relevant stakeholders such as the department
of Social Welfare should consider the implementation of social and emotional support
programs that can help to alleviate the emotional stress of pregnant women especially for
poor and single women Counseling units specifically focusing on pregnant women could
be set up at the maternal and childcare units of health care centers to support women who
need help
Second the belief that pregnant women could be cursed has implications for safe
motherhood policies and programs in Ghana As the findings indicated some pregnant
women use traditional medical practitioners including faith healers due to the belief that
they could be cursed This does not promote safe motherhood practices and should be
addressed Public health education must focus on explaining to women and communities
the risk and non risk factors associated with pregnancy and childbirth as well as correcting
misperceptions that may have a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes
Third the impact of poverty was a major risk factor identified by the participants
Current socio economic conditions in the country are having dire consequences on the poor
Women
References
and this could seriously affect Ghana s quest to achieve its Sustainable Development Goal
Poverty among women needs serious attention through protective social interventions The
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Gender Children and Social Protection could partner
with community organizations including churches and other religious groups to augment
government efforts to reduce poverty among deprived communities
Conclusions
The findings of the study revealed that low income urban women in Ghana have
a wide range of knowledge and perceptions of risk factors for negative pregnancy and
childbirth outcomes The women viewed pregnancy as a unique experience but they
acknowledged that it could be affected by a host of medical and non medical issues
which could lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes including negatively affecting the health
of the mother and the baby Though the study focused on urban women these risk
perceptions and knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth are held by many Ghanaian
women The findings also suggest that despite efforts being made to reduce maternal
morbidity and mortality in Ghana many pregnant women are still at risk of pregnancy
related complications This study therefore brings to the fore the need to employ multiple
approaches to safe motherhood programs social economic religious and psychological
to help poor pregnant women While these activities will reduce barriers to quality maternal
healthcare health education should be ramped up to address superstitious beliefs as well
as cultural misperceptions about pregnancy risk factors

Prenatal Weight Gain and Postpartum Weight
Retention A Delicate Balance
Everyone agrees that women are
supposed to grow larger with pregnancy
but great controversy has surrounded rec
ommendations for prenatal weight gain
throughout the century Forty years
ago most American obstetricians be
lieved that maternal weight gain caused
maternal antenatal and intrapartum com
plications as well as obesity and restric
tion of prenatal weight gain to a maximum
of or pounds was common practice
In the National Academy of Sci
ences concluded that limiting maternal
weight gain was potentially harmful be
cause it increased the risk of low fetal
birthweight and its concurrent morbidity
and mortality For the years that fol
lowed prenatal weight gain recommenda
tions hovered between and pounds
and research examining maternal weight
gain intensified During this time almost
all of the studies were to assess
how maternal gain related to fetal out
come
In the Institute of Medicine an
alyzed the scientific evidence relating to
weight gain during and formu
lated new recommendations for healthy
gestational weight gain These guidelines
which have been widely disseminated are
individualized on the basis of body mass
index criteria according to the mother s
weight for height prior to pregnano The
specific weight gain targets for under
weight normal weight overweight and
obese women are to lb to lb
to lb and a minimum of lb re
spectively The Institute of Medicine rec
ommendations also encourage young ad
olescents and Black women groups at
especially high risk for low birthweight to
gain at the higher end of their specific body
mass index range and short women who
may be at increased risk for fetopelvic dis
proportion to gain at the lower end of the
range The development of weight gain
recommendations based on body mass in
dex was a result of the Institute s findin
that the effect of a given weight gain on
fetal size diminishes as the mother s
prepregnant body size increases The rec
omxnendation of a range of gain rather
than a single figure reflected evidence that
a great variability in matemal weight gain
is observed among women with good
pregnan outcomes
A major objective of these recom
mendations is to optimize fetal birth
weight Although the Institute recognizes
that low birthweight is caused by multiple
factors and that maternal weight gain is
not a panacea its recommendations are
designed to promote matemal weight gain
as one way of protecting the fetus
Can promoting maternal weight gain
also be harmful Determining the health
iest matemal weight gain requires that we
consider other outcomes in addition to fe
tal outcomes Unfortunately much less is
known about how prenatal weight gain af
fects the pregnancy labor and delivery
experience or the long term health of the
mother In an attempt to address concerns
about maternal health the authors of the
Institute of Medicine report considered
evidence that very high maternal gain in
creases high fetal weight and its compli
cations and may also increase postpartum
obesity From the limited data available
they estimated an upper limit of weight
gain At the same time they called for new
studies to evaluate the impact of gesta
tional weight gain on maternal pregnan

outcome and maternal obesity and they
specifically identified the need to test the
recommended weight gain ranges against
specific pregnancy outcomes
In this issue of the Journal Keppel
and respond to this challenge
Their analysis of selected participants in
the National Maternal and Infant
Survey suggests a strong and positive as
sociation between prenatal weight gain
and postpartum weight retention to
months after birth More than one third of
the respondents reported weight gains that
exceeded the Institute of Medicine recom
mendations and this group retained a me
dian of lb women who gained less than
the recommended amount retained a me
dian of lb and women who gained
within the recommended range retained a
median of lb When the data were ex
amined separately by race there was little
evidence that White women retained ex
cess weight postpartum when they gained
within the recommended range How
ever at every level of weight gain Black
women reported retaining much more
weight than did YOIite women For exam
ple when prenatal gain was below within
and above the recommended range the
proportions of White women who retained
lb or more were and
respectively whereas among Black
women these proportions were
and
The racial differential in weight reten
tion among National Maternal and Infant
Survey participants was also evident in a
recent multivariate analysis that examined
risk factors for excessive retention de
fined as retention of at least lb an av
erage of months postpartum in women
who began with a normal body
mass index After controlling for a vari
ety of potentialb confounding variables
the researchers found that excessive
weight retention was twice as frequent
among Black than among White mothers
Risk factors for weight retention differed
in the two groups For example high par
ity was predictive of weight retention only
for Black women and marital status was
predictive only for White women Both
low socioeconomic status and weight gain
above the recommended range however
were associated with a doubled risk of
weight retention for both races
The finding that postpartum weight
retention is relatively low in White women
who gain within the recommended range
amrms the usefulness of the Institute of
Medicine weight gain recommendations
at least for part of the US population This
information can be added to other evi
August Vol No
dence suggesting that women who gain
within the recommended ranges have bet
ter pregnang outcomes than do women
who gain above or below them
It is not surprising that women with
large gestational weight gains will take
longer to lose weight postpartum than
those who gain less How can we help
women to gain within the recommended
range What should we do when it ap
pears that a gravid woman is gaining far
more than the amount recommended Be
fore we allow the concept of ri d calorie
restriction for pregnant women once more
to rear its ugly head we should remember
that placing pregnant women on restricted
diets not only restricted fetal growth but
also created enormous stress between
women and their obstetrical caregivers
years ago Yet we know that the dietary
practices and activity patterns of many
American women are not as good as they
should be Perhaps the best approach at
this point is to provide individualized as
sessment and sensitive counseling as part
of prenatal and postpartum care to en
courage good nutrition for every woman
Clinical guidelines to support such care
have recently been published
The more complicated issue is how to
interpret the finding that at any level of
weight gain Black women retain more
weight postpartum than do White women
A possible explanation is suggested by an
other national survey that is reported in
this issue of the Joumal Data from the
and Continuing Surveys of
Food Intakes by Individuals were exam
ined to compare reported mean enery in
takes for women before during and after
pregnancy Among the nonlactating
women White women appeared to de
crease their enery intake after preg
nan whereas Black women reported
mean increases of kcal kJ over
their prepreglant intake during the first
months after birth and more than kcal
kJ over their prepregnant intakes
later in the postpartum year Thus there is
evidence that Black women may be re
taining weight because they are not cutting
back on their energy intake whereas
White women are A sunilar finding has
been reported for adult women who were
not postpartum
It is also possible that the racial dif
ference in postpartum weight retention
may be attributable to problems in study
methodoloy The cross sectional design
of the National Maternal and Infant Sur
vey does not allow us to know whether the
postpartum maternal weight represents
retention of prenatal weight gain or a re
Editorials
gain of weight following an initial loss
There are undoubtably inaccuracies in re
called weights as a result of the retrospec
tive data collection and it is also possible
that there may be differential recall bias by
race However we cannot ignore evi
dence that postpartum weight retention
differs by race in a nationally representa
twe sample We must now follow up this
finding with carefully conducted research
to examine differences in and risk factors
for postpartum weight retention in a vari
ety of population subgroups
As pointed out by Krieger s annota
tion in this issue of the Journal we often
devote a great deal of enery to defining
biomedical outcomes but are much less
precise and thoughtful about defining the
social factors that predict the outcomes
As we design future studies we should
keep in mind the fact that currently avail
able data allow us to classify women by
race but it is likely that race is simply a
proxy for social economic environmen
tal cultural and other factors that influ
ence women s health

Improving Cause of Death Statistics The Case of Fetal Deaths
One could say that modem public
health virtually began with the national
system of mortality statistics for England
and Wales instituted by William Farr in
The vital statistics system has been
a valuable and essential public health re
source Over the years the information
provided has not only enhanced our un
derstanding of the magnitude and causes
of death and illness but has influenced the
direction of many health initiatives With
the advent of the Department of Health
and Human Services Healthy People
objectives many of which are based
on health measurements of cause of death
derived from the vital statistics system
and with the apparent federal policy of
linking these objectives to funding of pub
lic health progams the need for timely
vital statistics of high quality is even more
pronounced
Recent interest in tracking health out
comes has once again raised questions
about the reliability of cause of death in
formation Numerous articles have been
written on the subject and at least one na
tional workshop has been held
tions have been made about ways to im
prove both the quality and completeness
of reporting cause of death on the death
certificate The article by Kirby in this is
sue of the Journal fetal deaths into
the debate
As a component of the vital statistics
system fetal death reports should be
viewed as a source of information for
monitoring the health of mothers and in
fants during the perinatal period Many
current proposals to lower infant and per
inatal mortality focus on preventive health
care during pregnancy and on the problem
of preterm delivery This focus shifts the
emphasis of research and delivery pro
grams from intervention to prevention and
from infants to pregnancies As the shifts
occur we need to sharpen the distinctions
between intrapartum fetal deaths those
that occur during labor and late antepar
tum fetal deaths those that occur before
labor and between early and late fetal
death
The need for reliable cause of death
statistics on all pregnancies in which the
American Journal of Public Health
fetus was unable to survive to ftill devel
opment is becoming more evident Such
statistics would provide much needed in
formation on the causes of perinatal
deaths many of which occur before birth
In North Carolina for example there
were fetal deaths of or more weeks
gestation reported in compared with
neonatal deaths Refining these num
bers further there were fetal plus
early neonatal less than week s gesta
tion deaths reported compared with
deaths of infants aged days or older
The call for increased surveillance of
the causes of fetal deaths has gained mo
mentum In for example the Na
tional Center for Health Statistics NCHS
and the states agreed to include cause of
fetal death data in the Vital Statistics Co
operative Program contract Soon after
ward preliminary instructions were issued
on coding cause of fetal death and editing
querying and quality control of fetal death
reports A NCHS survey revealed
that about of the responding states
out of were either using the draft
procedures in or planning to use them
in M MacDorman PhD written
communication January
Concurrently with these guidelines
NCHS commenced two evaluations re
lated to fetal death reports One involved
an assessment of the feasibility and cost of
querying these reports and the current
coding procedures and practices of the
various states The second was the
National Maternal and Infant Health Sur
vey which incorporated a component on
assessing the quality and completeness of
underlying data The
results were to be used to evaluate the
feasibility of coding cause of fetal death
data on the National Vital Statistics file
The recent attention to fetal death
coding in combination with the prelimi
nary NCHS guidelines has not yet re
duced the high proportion of fetal records
with imprecise cause of death informa
tion Kirby s analysis of five states re
vealed that the percentage of such records
ranged from to in the period
through In the National Maternal
and Infant Health Survey NCHS found
a comparable overall percentage
but much wider variance among the states
to Even in North Carolina in
which Kirby found a imprecise
record rate significantly high proportions
of fetal reports with imprecise cause of
death information continue to exist If we
apply Kirby s definitions to and
records for example and re
spectively of North Carolina fetal records
had imprecise cause of death informa
tion
Interestingly about of the North
Carolina fetal deaths in and
were autopsied Of those autopsied about
per year had an imprecise un
derlying cause of death Further study is
needed to determine why more precise
causes were not listed on the fetal reports
after autopsy
Clearly insumcient priority has been
given to improving cause of death report
ing on the fetal records No national uni

There is level I evidence that screening for and treating gestational diabetes in singleton pregnancies reduce maternal and neonatal
morbidity However similar data for gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies are currently lacking Consequently the current approach for
the diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies is based on the same diagnostic criteria and glycemic targets
used in singleton pregnancies However twin pregnancies have unique physiological characteristics and many of the typical gestational
diabetes related complications are less relevant for twin pregnancies These differences raise the question of whether the greater increase
in insulin resistance observed in twin pregnancies which is often diagnosed as diet treated gestational diabetes should be considered
physiological and potentially beneficial in which case alternative criteria should be used for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies In this review we summarize the most up to date evidence on the epidemiology pathophysiology and clinical conse
quences of gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies and review the available data on twin specific screening and diagnostic criteria for
gestational diabetes Although twin pregnancies are associated with a higher incidence of diet treated gestational diabetes diet treated
gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies is less likely to be associated with adverse outcomes and accelerated fetal growth than in
singleton pregnancies and may reduce the risk for intrauterine growth restriction In addition there is currently no evidence that treatment
of diet treated gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies improves outcomes whereas preliminary data suggest that strict glycemic control
in such cases might increase the risk for intrauterine growth restriction Overall these findings provide support to the hypothesis that the
greater transient increase in insulin resistance observed in twin pregnancies is merely a physiological exaggeration of the normal increase
in insulin resistance observed in singleton pregnancies that is meant to support fetuses rather than a pathology that requires treatment
These data illustrate the need to develop twin specific screening and diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes to avoid overdiagnosis of
gestational diabetes and to reduce the risks associated with overtreatment of diet treated gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies
Although data on twin specific screening and diagnostic criteria are presently scarce preliminary data suggest that the optimal screening
and diagnostic criteria in twin pregnancies are higher than those currently used in singleton pregnancies

Introduction
Gestational diabetes GDM is a com
mon pregnancy complication
affecting to of the pregnancies
in North America Approximately
decades ago it was questioned whether
GDM is a distinct disease that is associ
ated with adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes to an extent that it justifies
routine screening and treatment or
whether it is in fact a nonentity This
controversy has largely been resolved
following the publication of large trials
that provided evidence that the diagnosis
and treatment of GDM improve preg
nancy outcomes However these trials
were limited to singleton pregnancies
and therefore comparable data to sup
port the benefits of screening for and
treatment of GDM in twin pregnancies
are lacking This has been acknowledged
in a recent statement by the Society for
Maternal Fetal Medicine on the state of
science on multifetal gestations accord
ing to which twins have been represented
in only of the trials on GDM and
this is also reflected in the lack of any
specific guidance from professional so
cieties on the diagnosis and management
of GDM in twin pregnancies Conse
quently the contemporary approach for
the diagnosis and management of GDM
in twin pregnancies is based on the same
diagnostic criteria and glycemic targets
used in singleton pregnancies
However twin pregnancies have
unique physiological characteristics
such as a greater increase in insulin
resistance and greater nutritional
demands
In addition many of the
typical GDM related complications are
much less relevant to twin pregnancies
as discussed later
These differ
ences raise the question of whether the
greater insulin resistance and the asso
ciated relative hyperglycemia observed
in twin pregnancies should be viewed as
physiological and potentially beneficial
in which case alternative criteria should
be used for the screening and diagnosis
of GDM in twin pregnancies
The goal of this review was to address
this question by summarizing the most
up to date evidence on the epidemi
ology pathophysiology and clinical

data on twin specific screening and
diagnostic criteria for GDM
Is gestational diabetes more common
in twin pregnancies
GDM affects to of twin
Although several
pregnancies
studies reported a higher incidence of
GDM in twin pregnancies
others failed to observe such differences
Table
These conflicting re
sults may be attributed to the limitations
of previous studies including small
sample sizes
a lack of
adjustment for confounding variables
such as maternal age obesity and
and failure to differentiate
race
between the type of GDM diet
controlled GDMAI vs medically
controlled
In a
recent large population based study in
Ontario Canada women with twins
had a greater risk of GDMAI adjusted

interval CI but not
am
Based on these large scale
findings it was concluded that the
higher incidence of GDM in twin preg
nancies is a consequence of a greater
predisposition for GDMAI
What is the pathophysiology of
gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies
The higher incidence of GDMAI in twin
pregnancies may be explained by differ
ences in the pathophysiology of GDM
In singleton pregnancies GDM has been
attributed primarily to a failure of the
maternal pancreas to compensate for the
physiological increase in insulin resis
tance in pregnancy most likely because
of an underlying subclinical maternal
beta cell dysfunction Figure l
This mechanism is responsible for the
well established association between
GDM and future maternal type
diabetes
In twin pregnancies a certain pro
portion of cases of GDM may likely be
the consequence of a greater transient
increase in insulin resistance observed in
MONTH
ajog org
these pregnancies because of the greater
placental mass and subsequently the
higher
levels
of diabetogenic
hormones
in the presence of
normal beta cell function or a lesser de
gree of beta cell dysfunction than that
observed in cases of GDM in singleton
pregnancies Thus GDM may occur in
twin pregnancies despite a pancreatic
response that would have been sufficient
to compensate for the typical increase in
insulin resistance seen in singleton
pregnancies but that is insufficient to
counteract the greater increase in insulin
resistance that occurs with twin gesta
tions
Figure This hypothesis is sup
ported by the observation that women
who had GDM in a twin pregnancy are
approximately less likely to develop
type diabetes following the index
pregnancy than those who had GDM in a
singleton pregnancy Figure
Is gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies associated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes
Regardless of the mechanisms underly
ing GDM in twins the question that is
most relevant for clinicians is if GDM in
twins is associated with the same com
plications reported in singleton preg
nancies namely accelerated fetal growth
macrosomia shoulder dystocia birth
trauma preeclampsia cesarean delivery
and neonatal complications such as hy
poglycemia jaundice and respiratory
morbidity
The rationale underlying this question
is clear Some of these complications
such as macrosomia and shoulder
dystocia are unlikely to be clinically
relevant for twin pregnancies given that
twin fetuses are born earlier and are
smaller on average than singleton fe
tuses Other complications such as
preeclampsia cesarean delivery and
neonatal complications are more com
mon in twin gestations irrespective of
GDM because of the greater placental
mass fetal malpresentation and higher
rates of prematurity respectively
and thus GDM especially GDMAI is
unlikely to have a major impact on the
risks of these complications in twin
pregnancies

In singleton pregnancies upper panel GDM has been attributed primarily to a failure of the maternal

mechanism is responsible for the well established association between GDM and future maternal
type diabetes In twin pregnancies lower a certain proportion of cases of GDMAI may likely
be caused by the greater transient increase in insulin resistance observed in these pregnancies
rather than from underlying maternal beta cell dysfunction despite an adequate pancreatic

associated with a risk for a large for gesta

Table Accordingly the authors
concluded that GDM is not associated with
adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies In a
more recent meta analysis on the associa
tion between GDM and adverse outcomes
in singleton n studies and twin
n studies pregnancies Greco et al
found that the association of GDM with
cesarean delivery and neonatal intensive
care unit NICU admission was weaker in
twin pregnancies Supplemental Table
In
addition GDM in twin pregnancies but
not in singleton pregnancies was
American Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology
associated with a reduced risk of having a

RR Cl and of
neonatal death RR CI
However many of the studies
included in these meta analyses were
relatively small
and did not ac
count for confounding variables such as
maternal race
and obesity
In
addition most of these studies did not
include a positive control group of
singleton pregnancies with and without
GDM that would allow for a direct com
parison of the effects of GDM in twin
compared with singleton pregnancies
Supplemental Table
To address this limitation we recently
completed a large population based
study from Ontario Canada in which
we evaluated the association between
GDM and adverse outcomes in singleton
pregnancies and separately in twin
pregnancies In singleton pregnancies

range of adverse maternal and neonatal
outcomes In contrast in twin preg
nancies many of these associations were
either nonsignificant or weaker than
those observed in singleton pregnancies
although we did identify an association
with LGA as discussed in the next sec
tion
Supplemental Table These find
ings confirm previous observations that
GDM in twin pregnancies is less likely to
be associated with many of the adverse
maternal and neonatal outcomes asso
ciated with GDM in singleton
pregnancies
Is gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies associated with
accelerated fetal growth
We and others found that GDM in twin
pregnancies is associated with an increa
sed risk for an LGA newborn
although most studies did not distinguish
between cases of GDMAI and
In addition LGA at birth is a poor mea
sure of fetal growth because it only repre
sents the end result and does not provide
information on the effect of GDM on
fetal growth throughout gestation
To better understand the impact of
GDM on fetal growth in twin pregnan
cies we recently compared the fetal
growth patterns of twin fetuses with and
without GDM and separately those of
singleton fetuses with and without GDM

the question of if GDM in twin preg

Diet controlled gestational diabetes
in twin pregnancies physiology or
pathology
The data reviewed above suggest that
although twin pregnancies are associated
with a higher incidence of GDMAI
GDMAI in twins is less likely to be
associated with adverse maternal and
neonatal outcomes is not associated
with accelerated fetal growth and may
be associated with a reduction in the
proportion of small fetuses Taken
together these findings raise the ques
tion of whether GDMAI in twin
pregnancies is indeed a pathology that
requires treatment or whether the iden
tification and treatment of GDMAI
might lead to more harm than good
Glycemic control in twin pregnancies
with gestational diabetes are we
improving or worsening outcomes
In a case controlled study entitled
Glycemic control in twin pregnancies
with gestational diabetes Are we
improving or worsening outcomes Fox
et al assessed the relationship between
glycemic control and pregnancy out
comes among women with a twin
pregnancy complicated by GDM The
authors found that improved glycemic
control was not associated with a
reduction in the risk for preeclampsia
but was associated with a greater risk
of having an SGA infant Although
this study was the first to support
the hypothesis that treatment of GDM
in twins may cause more harm than
good it was relatively small considered
Clinical Opinion
preeclampsia as the only potential
adverse outcome did not stratify the
analysis by the type GDM and did not
include a control group of twin preg
nancies without GDM
Therefore we recently addressed the
same question using a larger cohort of
women with a twin pregnancy
complicated by GDM and a matched
control group of women with a twin
pregnancy without GDM The study
outcomes were a composite variable of
GDM related neonatal morbidity LGA
hypoglycemia requiring treatment jaun
dice requiring phototherapy birth
trauma or NICU admission and the
incidence of having an SGA infant We
found that good glycemic control was not
associated with a reduction in the risk of
composite neonatal morbidity when
compared with suboptimal glycemic
control vs aOR
Cl Figure
A In contrast
good glycemic control was associated
with higher odds of having an SGA
neonate when compared with non GDM
pregnancies especially in the subgroup of
pregnancies with GDMAI vs
Cl
whereas the rate of SGA in GDM preg
nancies with suboptimal control was not
significantly different than that in non
GDM pregnancies Figure
B In
addition in cases of GDMAI good gly
cemic control was associated with a left
shift in the distribution of birth weight
percentiles whereas the distribution of
birth weight percentiles among GDM
pregnancies with suboptimal control was
similar to that of non GDM pregnancies
Figure
C We concluded that in pa
tients with GDM in a twin pregnancy
good glycemic control was not associated
with a reduction in the risk of GDM
related complications but it may in
crease the risk for SGA infants in the
subgroup of patients with GDMAI
These findings may be attributed to the
direct effect of a lower mean blood
glucose levels on fetal growth through the
insulin or insulin like growth factor sys
or to insufficient maternal

intrauterine growth restriction especially
in twin pregnancies
Diet controlled gestational diabetes in
twin pregnancies as a physiological
exaggeration of the normal increase in
insulin resistance meant to support
fetuses
The observations described above
further challenge the current view that
GDMAI in twin pregnancies is a pa
thology that merits screening and
treatment Instead these findings pro
vide the basis for the hypothesis that the
greater transient increase in insulin
resistance observed in twin pregnancies
which is often interpreted as GDMAI
based on the standard diagnostic
criteria is merely a physiological exag
geration of the normal increase in in
sulin resistance observed in singleton
pregnancies designed to support the
metabolic requirements of fetuses
This hypothesis is aligned with the fact
that most of the physiological changes
American Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology
of pregnancy are exaggerated in twin
For example when
pregnancies
compared with singleton pregnancies
twin pregnancies are associated with a
greater increase in cardiac output
vs a greater increase in
stroke volume and a greater in
crease in blood volume vs
to support the larger feto
placental circulation in the presence of
fetuses and yet we do not treat
women with twin pregnancies with
drugs such as beta blockers or diuretics
in an attempt to normalize their cardiac
function and blood volume respec
tively to the levels observed in singleton
pregnancies Therefore the greater in
crease in insulin resistance found in
twin pregnancies should perhaps also
be viewed as a physiological exaggera
tion of the normal increase in insulin
resistance observed in singleton preg
nancies that is meant to support fe
tuses acknowledging that the only
problem with this specific exaggerated
MONTH
physiological change is that it is detec
ted as a pathology by the screening and
diagnostic tests for GDM that were
developed and validated in singleton
pregnancies And if that is indeed the
case then what is needed is to use
alternative twin specific screening and
diagnostic criteria for GDM in twin
pregnancies that take into account this
exaggerated physiological change

However similar data on the perfor
mance of the screening GCT in twin
pregnancies are lacking In a recent
meta analysis on the screening accuracy
of the GCT in twin pregnancies
we identified a total of studies All
studies were retrospective and included
information on the diagnostic OGTT
only for women with a positive screen
during the GCT
Consequently none of the studies nor
our meta analysis could determine the
sensitivity and specificity of the
GCT for GDM in twin pregnancies This
means that the GCT is currently
used to screen for GDM in twin preg
nancies with the same threshold used in
singleton pregnancies despite the fact
that there are currently no data on the
screening accuracy of this test in the twin
pregnancy population
In of the studies mentioned
Rebarber et found that when
compared with the
standard
threshold of mg dL used in their
practice a higher threshold of
mg dL mmol L maintained the
same sensitivity but reduced the risk
for a false positive result in twin
pregnancies The authors concluded
that in twin pregnancies the optimal
GCT threshold should be higher
than that used in singleton
pregnancies
In a more recent large population
based study from Ontario Canada in
which the
standard GCT
screening threshold was mg dL
mmol L we compared the
screening performance of the
GCT between women with singleton
and those with twin pregnancies We
found that based on the estimated
false positive rate the optimal
GCT threshold in twin pregnancies is
higher than that in singleton preg
nancies and should approach mg
dL mmol L

optimal approach for the identification

ever this approach was unlikely to be

described in the sections above the
goal should be to avoid diagnosing

However the extra increase in insulin resistance in twin pregnancies may reflect a physiological

hyperglycemia is solely caused by the exaggerated physiological increase in insulin resistance

OGTT criteria in relation to future
maternal risk of type diabetes has been

development and validation of the original

GDM by O Sullivan and Mahan which
were subsequently transformed to the

Clinical Opinion
What are the concerns regarding the
use of twin specific criteria
One of the main concerns regarding the
use of more liberal twin specific diag
nostic criteria for GDM in twin preg
nancies is that in utero fetal exposure to
mild hyperglycemia even if not associ
ated with immediate neonatal
morbidity may disrupt optimal fetal
programming and lead to long term
metabolic complications similar to
those reported among singletons
including childhood obesity diabetes
and future cardiovascular disease
However most data on the association
of GDM and accelerated fetal growth
with long term morbidity in the
offspring originates from studies in
singleton pregnancies whereas similar
long term follow up studies in twin
pregnancies are lacking In addition
even if these associations also apply to
twin pregnancies it should be noted that
the association between deviant fetal
growth and long term morbidity in the
offspring is more pronounced for intra
uterine growth restriction and low birth
weight than for LGA Thus it may be
argued that even if GDMAI is associated
with a mild degree of fetal growth ac
celeration in twin pregnancies the
reduction in the proportion of small
twin fetuses who are smaller than the
average singleton fetus and are at greater
risk for growth restriction and the po
tential to avoid intrauterine growth re
striction secondary to strict glycemic
control in twin pregnancies with
GDMAI may lead to an overall reduc
tion in the long term metabolic risk of
the twin pregnancy offspring population
Figure Still studies on the long
term metabolic health of twin infants
or studies that use surrogate markers for
these outcomes such as cord c peptide
neonatal fat mass and epigenetic
markers would provide important
insight into the optimal diagnostic
threshold and glycemic targets for GDM
in twin pregnancies

Our main findings are as follows
twin pregnancies are associated with a
higher incidence of GDMAI than
singleton pregnancies the greater
incidence of GDMAI is likely to be
mediated by the greater transient in
crease in insulin resistance that occurs in
twin pregnancies instead of reflecting
lower maternal pancreatic beta cell
dysfunction and greater maternal pre
disposition for type diabetes
GDMAI is less likely to be associated
with adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes and with accelerated fetal
growth in twin pregnancies than in
singleton pregnancies and may be asso
ciated with a reduction in the proportion
of small infants and there is no
American Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology
evidence that the diagnosis and treat
ment of GDMAI in twin pregnancies is
associated with improved maternal and
neonatal outcomes in fact there is some
evidence that strict glycemic control in
cases of GDMAI in twin pregnancies
may substantially increase the risk of
intrauterine growth restriction Collec
tively these findings support the hy
pothesis that the greater transient
increase in insulin resistance observed in
twin pregnancies which is often inter
preted as GDMAI based on the standard
diagnostic criteria is merely a physio
logical exaggeration of the typical in
crease in insulin resistance that occurs in
singleton pregnancies that is meant to
support the metabolic requirements of
MONTH
two fetuses instead of a pathology that
requires treatment
We therefore conclude that a major
priority for future funding in twin
pregnancy research is to establish twin
specific screening and diagnostic
criteria for GDM which can avoid the
overdiagnosis of GDM and reduce the
risks associated with over treatment of
GDMAI in twin pregnancies Although
preliminary data suggest that the optimal
g GCT screening cutoff and the
OGTT diagnostic criteria in twin preg
nancies are higher than those currently
used in singleton pregnancies these
exploratory twin specific criteria need
to be validated in adequately powered
prospective studies Until such data

The figure presents the association between birthweight and the risk of type DM in the offspring
based on a meta analysis of studies The risk of future type DM is greatest for infants with low
birth weight especially for birth weight below kg and to a lesser extent for infants with birth
weight kg The green curve represents birth weight distribution among unselected twin infants
born at weeks gestation in a single tertiary center Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Toronto
ON Canada n unpublished data of the twins weighed kg weighed
only weighed above kg and none of the infants weighed more than kg
The red curves represent the theoretical potential right shift in the curve in twin pregnancies with
GDM Although such a right shift would lead to a reduction in the proportion of infants with birth
weight kg and kg who are at an increased risk for future type DM it is unlikely to lead
to a substantial increase in the proportion of infants with birth weight kg This schematic figure
highlights the uncertainty regarding whether mild fetal growth acceleration secondary to GDM would
necessarily be harmful to the long term health of twin infants or whether it might actually have a
beneficial role Adapted from Knop et al

become available we recommend that
the screening diagnosis and manage
ment of GDM in twin pregnancies
follow the same approach currently used
in singleton pregnancies Still we advise
caution in cases for which there is evi
dence of growth restriction of the twin
fetuses and in which the mother expe
riences limited gestational weight gain
because of strong adherence to a low
calorie diabetic diet because insuffi
cient maternal weight gain in twin
pregnancies has been associated with an
increased risk for intrauterine growth
In such cases we
restriction
argue that care providers should ensure
adequate maternal caloric intake and
maternal weight gain even if this is
associated with a reduction in the
proportion of blood glucose levels that
are in the target range

A study on referral pattern for fetal
echocardiography and identifying the various risk
factors for congenital heart defects
Abstract
Background Fetal Echocardiography is becoming an important tool for the detection of
CHD but results can be unpredictable depending on various factors like expertise position
of the baby and referral indications Various factors are associated with detection of CHD
which need further evaluation
The present study was undertaken to study the referral pattern for Fetal Echocardiography
FE at a tertiary Pediatric Cardiac Centre and further to identify the various risk factors
associated with Congenital heart defect
Results The study was conducted on consecutive pregnant women who were referred
for fetal echocardiography at Pediatric Cardiac Unit of the hospital The mean maternal age
and the mean gestational age were years and weeks at the time of
fetal screening On evaluating the various referral indications gestational diabetes mellitus
was found in of the study subjects but CHD was detected in of their fetuses
Hypothyroidism was the second commonest indication among the referrals and
of their foetuses were found to have CHD The indication that accounted for the maximum
number of CHD was cardiac anomaly detected on ultrasonography followed
by single umbilical artery in which of CHD was detected CHD was however
significantly associated only with the referral indications of cardiac anomaly on USG p
value and single umbilical artery p value The association of the other
referral indications of the subjects was not found to be significant
Conclusion Majority of women referred late for the fetal echocardiography screening
Extracardiac anomaly during second trimester scan warrants immediate fetal cardiac
evaluation

Background
A congenital heart defect CHD is defined as a defect in
the structure of the heart or great vessels occurring during fetal
development l The prevalence of CHD globally is around per
thousand live with a mortality of per population
Prenatal detection of CHD is of utmost importance since heart defects
are associated with significant morbidity and mortality besides
antenatal detection helps in planning the further management Fetal
echocardiography is becoming an important tool for screening and
can identify many structural heart diseases but it is highly variable
depending on operator expertise gestational age fetal position and
the type of cardiac defect but there is improvement in detection of
CHD lately The yield of fetal echo in detection of CHD depends
not only on the expertise of the performer but also on the indication
of referral Nevertheless its an important tool for early detection of
CHD and with the availability of newer and highly sophisticated
dedicated machines CHDs can be detected in utero during second
trimester or even in late first trimester with a detection rate of
in specialized units
There are numerous risk factors associated with development of
CHD pregestational diabetes is an important and most documented
one by various authors S American Heart Association in has
provided a list ofrisk factors for screening the high risk mothers leading
to CHD in fetus The referral pattern for fetal echocardiography
among pregnant women is a reflection of the spectrum of women
visiting for fetal echocardiography and it assists in identifying and for
better understanding of congenital heart defects and the risk factors
associated with it
Methods
The aim of the study was to study the referral pattern for Fetal
Echocardiography FE at a tertiary Pediatric Cardiac Centre and
to identify the various risk factors associated with Congenital heart
defect lt was a prospective observational study conducted at Pediatric
Cardiac Unit ofa University affiliated tertiary medical care facility
Study population The study was conducted on consecutive
pregnant women who were referred for fetal echocardiography during
the study period at Pediatric Cardiac Unit of the hospital Valid
informed and written consent was obtained from the pregnant females
before including them in the study The study was approved by the
Ethical committee of the Medical College
Sampling procedure The information was recorded in a predesigned
proforma for the profile of patients pregnant women indications
of referral and the risk factors if any associated with CHD were
identified

anomaly on ultrasonography screening were found to have congenital
heart defects the maximum proportion of CHD While one out of
three women referred with an indication of single umbilical artery was
found to have a congenital heart disease There was one CHD
in each group of polyhydroamnios women and women with a
history of CHD in their previous child One CHD was detected in the
fetus of one of the women who had a referral indication of previous
unexplained early neonatal deaths CHD was detected in the fetus of
four of women with gestational diabetes mellitus Only I
out of women with hypothyroidism was found to have CHD
in their fetuses None of the fetuses with echogenic intracardiac foci
foetal bradycardia and history of Down syndrome in previous
child had CHD However six women were in the miscellaneous
group four of whom had haemophilia A and two of whom had vitiligo
CHD was not detected in their foetuses
Spectrum of congenital heart disease among fetuses Table
illustrates the various types of congenital heart diseases that were
found among fetuses on Fetal echocardiography Out of I I CHDs AV
canal defects were the most common accounting for ofthe total
CHDs Hypoplastic left heart syndrome HLHS was the second most
common CHD detected The distribution of single ventricle
and isolated ventricular septal defect VSD was equal i e
Apart from CHDs various other cardiac abnormalities were also
found in the fetuses on echocardiography as depicted A significant
tricuspid regurgitation T R was found in the fetuses of six women
Five fetuses had ventricular disproportion of which three had more
left ventricular LV than right ventricular RV disproportion Dilated
RV was found in two women while one had ventricular hypertrophy
Type of congenital heart disease in each group Different types of
CHDs were detected in the various categories of referral indications
are depicted in Table In the category of gestational diabetes mellitus
four fetuses were found to have CHDs of all detected CHDs
which included one AV canal defect two HLHS and one isolated
V SD With polyhydramnios and single umbilical artery one fetus in
each group was found to have CHD which was HLHS
Association between various factors and congenital heart
diseases There was no significant association with the parity and
age of the mother with the incidence of CHD in the fetus Table
The association between the various referral indications and CHD is
illustrated in Table As seen in the table the association between
cardiac anomaly and the presence of single umbilical artery on
Ultrasonographic screening and incidence of CHD was found to be
statistically significant p value The association of congenital
heart defect with advanced maternal age was also studied by
Independent samples t test but no significant difference was found
between mean maternal age of the two groups No other referral
indication has the significant association with the CHD

Congenital heart defect is the commonest among the birth defects
affecting millions of children world wide One fifth of children are
likely to have significant problems that necessitate intervention in the
first year of life CHD is a major and fast growing health issue for
children worldwide Because of the severity of disease which affects
the quality of life early detection is a important in order to implement
early intervention A study conducted by Bhambani in which
fetal echo were performed of which women had no risk factor
associated with CHD A total of per fetuses were found
to have some cardiac abnormality of which per had
CHD In our study II fetuses were found to have CHD while
fetuses were found to have functional cardiac abnormalities
While another study from Northern India found incidence of CHD as
per
In a recent study by Qiu X and coworkers evaluated fetal
echocardiography of pregnant women in which fetuses
were found to have CHD Prenatal genetic examination on amniotic
fluid and cord blood revealed chromosomal abnormalities in
of foetuses with CHD Hence they recommended interventional
prenatal genetic evaluation for fetuses with CHD to rule out the
chromosomal abnormalities
A cross sectional study on one hundred and one pregnant
women in Egypt was to determine the clinical utility of fetal
echocardiography FE They performed FE and detected congenital
heart defects CHDs in of which complex cardiac lesions
that were diagnosed included common atrioventricular canal cardiac
masses fetal arrhythmias and cono truncal anomalies Later they
performed postnatal transthoracic echocardiography on neonates
and concluded that fetal echo can accurately diagnose majority of
the complex lesions but can miss few critical defects like aortic
coarctation
A retrospective analysis on fetal echocardiography of
studied various referral indications like abnormal anatomy
scans maternal medical disorders family history of CHD and fetus
growth restrictions They reported CHD in of the fetuses They
also performed prenatal invasive testing and reported chromosomal
abnormalities in of the CHD detected foetuses In their study
they concluded that most CHDs occur during pregnancy even without
any underlying prenatal risk factor emphasising the importance of
routine foetal echocardiography scans and finding the association
between CHD and chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses
In our study the majority of referrals had a primary indication as
gestational diabetes mellitus However only of them were
detected to have CHD in their fetuses and the association between
gestational diabetes mellitus and CHD detection was not found to be
statistically significant p value Also of the referrals
had pregestational DM but none of their fetuses were found to have
CHD in them et al did a cohort study of two million births
over years and found a four fold increase in the risk of CHDs
in maternal pre gestational DM both types I and In a systemic
review Depla et al found that maternal diabetes Pregestational and
gestational is associated with fetal cardiac hypertrophy ventricular
diastolic dysfunction and overall impaired myocardial performance
This observation in our study is different from other studies where
majority of CHD is diagnosed in mothers with diabetes this might
be due to small sample size and association may be detected if we
had enrolled more numbers of mothers with diabetes especially with
pregestational diabetes
The second most common primary indication among referrals was
hypothyroidism and CHD was found in of their fetuses
Although the association between hypothyroidism and the detection
of CHD was not found to be significant enough p value
However a study by Grattanet showed CHD in of fetuses of
mothers having hypothyroidism suggesting a significant correlation
between maternal hypothyroidism and the development of CHD in
the fetus
Total of of the women were referred with the indication of
polyhydramnios of their fetuses were found to have CHD
and the association was not significant Polyhydramnios

ABSTRACT
Background Women with disabilities have the same rights as women without disabilities to prevent
unintended pregnancy yet little is known about their experiences in accessing family planning methods
Objective This qualitative descriptive study explored perceptions of barriers to effective family planning
services among women with disabilities
Method Semi structured open ended interviews were conducted with women with diverse dis
abilities as part of a larger study investigating risks and facilitators of unintended pregnancy among
women with disabilities across the United States
Results Analysis revealed multiple barriers experienced by women with disabilities in accessing effec
tive family planning services needed to prevent unintended pregnancy Barriers included physical or
system barriers financial limitations and nonresponsive healthcare providers Women also identified
difficulties in finding appropriate family planning methods both related and unrelated to disability
Conclusions This is the first in depth exploration of barriers to accessing family planning services and
challenges to finding effective family planning options among women with disabilities The findings
underscore the need for targeted interventions improved provider training and policy changes to
optimize reproductive healthcare improve access to family planning services and prevent unintended
pregnancy among women of childbearing age with diverse disabilities

unintended pregnancy as compared to White women and in
dividuals with higher incomes in the U S
Less studied is unintended pregnancy among women living
with disabilities Nearly of U S women of childbearing age live
with a disability Women with disabilities are increasingly
becoming pregnant and may be as likely to become pregnant as
women without disabilities Further women with disabilities are
as likely to report wanting to have a child as women without dis
abilities yet less certain about future pregnancy intentions Few
studies have examined unintended pregnancy among women with
disabilities Using Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring
System PRAMS data from Rhode Island researchers found women
with disabilities were significantly less likely to intend to become
pregnant than women without disability More recently using
data from the and waves of the National
Survey of Family Growth NSFG significant differences in preg
nancy intention were noted by disability status Specifically a
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
higher proportion of pregnancies were unintended among women
with disabilities as compared to women without disabilities i e
vs respectively and women reporting an independent
living disability had the highest proportion of unintended preg
nancies An examination by disability type revealed signifi
cantly higher adjusted odds of unintended pregnancies among
women with hearing disability cognitive disability and indepen
dent living disability than for pregnancies among women without
disabilities aOR Yet the reason for these disparities
remains largely unknown Using NSFG data researchers examined
population based estimates of use of family planning services
among women of reproductive age Findings revealed women with
disabilities were less likely to receive any family planning services
than women without disabilities and these disparities were most
pronounced in women reporting low education low income and
unemployment Additional analyses revealed among women ages
those living with disabilities were significantly less likely to
have received a method of birth control or birth control counseling
in the previous twelve months as compared to those without a
disability
There is a growing body of literature demonstrating substantial
inequities in the quality of healthcare received including experi
encing stigma and bias among women with disabilities Much of
this literature is focused on experiences during pregnancy with less
recognition of the critical importance of the preconception period
and its influence on subsequent pregnancy outcomes The quality
of care women with disabilities experience outside of pregnancy
care may be associated with an increased risk of unintended
pregnancy In a qualitative study of women living with spina bifida
women reported having a poor understanding of their pregnancy
potential in part due to insufficient information from healthcare
providers Another qualitative study focused on women living
with disabilities who experienced reproductive coercion found
that health care providers rarely screened for violence a known
risk factor for unintended pregnancy Attitudes and practices of
neurology providers regarding sexual and reproductive healthcare
for their adolescent and young adult patients with epilepsy were
recently explored with results demonstrating wide variability
among practitioners With regard to reproductive goals one
physician noted telling a patient not to get pregnant until you re
like and another physician describing telling women not to get
pregnant until they are transferred to adult neurology and then the
discussion can ensue regarding reproductive goals Ensuring ac
cess to effective family planning methods is critical to preventing
unintended pregnancy particularly for women with disabilities
who may face unique barriers to care Thus the purpose of the
current study was to explore perceptions of barriers to family
planning services among women living with disabilities
Methods
The current study reports the qualitative findings of a mixed
method parent study that examined risks and protective factors for
unintended pregnancy among US women living with diverse dis
abilities including those with hearing disability vision disability
cognitive disability mobility disability self care disability and in
dependent living disability The quantitative aims of the parent
study utilized data from two waves of the NSFG while the quali
tative aim explored women s experiences with reproductive health
care as well as the context of their unintended pregnancies Eligi
bility for participation in the qualitative aim reported here
included women between the ages of and who experienced
an unintended pregnancy after the onset of a disability experi
enced an unintended pregnancy within the prior two years and
reported the presence of a disability for at least two years at the
Disability and Health Journal
time of data collection Women were excluded if they were unable
to answer simple questions demonstrative of understanding of the
informed consent did not understand or express themselves in
English or American Sign Language lived in a nursing home or
other institution reported severe misuse of alcohol or other drugs
or expressed suicidal ideation The study was approved by the
University of Virginia Institutional Review Board
Given our goal to explore the experiences of women living with
diverse disabilities across the US we used multiple dissemination
methods to reach our population of interest Primary dissemination
methods included social media including Facebook groups and
individual social media platforms of individuals actively engaged in
the disability community disability related websites and
community based organizations Our study included a community
advisory board CAB comprised of nine individuals who identified
as women living with diverse disabilities living in different areas of
the US Our CAB was instrumental in our recruitment efforts using
their well established networks to disseminate study related
information
The qualitative aim of the parent study included women
living with a disability Four women were excluded due to having a
planned pregnancy n or the onset of a disability after expe
riencing an unintended pregnancy n The individual in depth
interviews were guided by a semi structured interview guide
which was developed by the study team in conjunction with our
CAB The interview guide drew upon findings generated from
quantitative findings in the parent study
Areas of exploration
included participants knowledge of family planning options
health care providers advice around family planning and their
perceptions on unique risks for experiencing an unintended
pregnancy
Data collection
The first author who has extensive clinical and research expe
rience working with women with disabilities conducted all of the
interviews in English over the phone and three participants used
telephone relay services for interview completion Phone in
terviews were necessary given this was a national sample On
average the interviews lasted h Prior to beginning each inter
view participants were reminded that they could skip or refuse to
answer any questions For participants who agreed to have in
terviews recorded the interviewer reminded them that the
recording be turned off during any portion of the interview Addi
tionally each participant was given a code word prior to the start of
the interview that they could use if they felt that their privacy was
in jeopardy given the sensitive nature of the topic Our safety plan
included thanking the participant for her time and ending the call
with the understanding that the participant would re contact the
interviewer at her convenience when her privacy could be main
tained if the code word was used This was not necessary in any of
the interviews conducted Three participants asked that their in
dividual interviews not be recorded though allowed ample time for
the interviewer to record comprehensive notes
Data analysis
Twenty eight of the interviews were audio recorded in full
and transcribed verbatim The three remaining interviews included
comprehensive notes regarding the interview including direct
quotes where appropriate ATLAS it software was used to assist in
the organization and management of data Two authors JA TB
analyzed transcripts using a thematic analysis approach which
started with an immersion in the participants experiences and the
development and refinement of a codebook which included
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
deductive codes derived from the interview guide as well as
inductive codes constructed from the transcripts
To ensure
consistency of findings an audit trail was maintained for trans
parency in the analytic phase During regular meetings with the
study team codes were collapsed refined and removed as
appropriate and any discrepancies in coding were discussed and
resolved via consensus The first two authors organized interview
text pertaining to the experience of unintended pregnancy into
themes and subthemes and matrix analysis was used to identify
similarities and differences among participants The entire study
team reviewed and refined themes and subthemes during research
meetings As a final step the first author reviewed each transcript
to ensure that appropriate coded exemplars were included in the
analysis and that appropriate themes had been identified
Using this thematic analysis approach we identified two major
themes including barriers to accessing family planning and the
unique considerations regarding family planning for women living
with disabilities With regards to barriers to accessing family
planning subthemes included barriers related to physical or sys
tem financial and healthcare provider

Barriers to accessing family planning
The first major theme related to disabled women s experiences
with family planning relates to the substantial and numerous
barriers to access that participants had to overcome to obtain
reproductive health care With one exception all participants re
ported barriers to obtaining family planning services and these
barriers were associated with an increased risk of experiencing an
unintended pregnancy Categories within this theme include
physical and financial barriers and healthcare providers who fail to
address disabled women s reproductive healthcare issues or even
seemingly to recognize that they have need of such care
Physical or system barriers kind of normal and natural in my
world
Participants spoke poignantly about physical or system level
barriers to care specific in accessing family planning services
Inaccessible medical equipment such as a lack of accessible exam
tables or wheelchairs to assist with longer distances e g from
parking lot to clinic as well as more system level barriers were
experienced by many One participant reported having to meet her
health care provider in an emergency room or obstetrical ward for
even routine care remarking I ve never been able to access care in
the same manner that other women would The clinic where her
provider saw patients did not have an accessible exam table for
routine examinations Several other women relayed experiences of
having to obtain routine care in non routine settings due to
accessibility issues These additional complexities in accessing care
often resulted in delayed or missed appointments with one
participant noting I should have had them l didn t want to go
through the hassle I ve probably done them less frequently than
recommended A Deaf participant faced challenges in obtaining
adequate information on birth control because poorly skilled or
unavailable interpreters added an additional barrier to navigate
She remarked the doctor didn t really explain all the other options
to me I think if the interpreter that had been there had been
doing a better job and was more interactive and more clear I would
have known and it just would have been more accessible infor
mation and then I could have made a better choice She further
described that she stopped her birth control method due to
breakthrough bleeding and was not aware of other options
A subtler physical barrier to care was that women were often
dependent on caregivers to take them to appointments or assist
with transfers During adolescence and young adulthood these
caregivers were often parents and thus conversations around
sexual activity and the potential for family planning options could
not freely be discussed A woman with a spinal cord injury
described how she felt her mother s presence at her appointments
kept her from being able to talk openly about her sexual health
recounting I was so dependent on her after my accident she had
to drive me everywhere When I wanted to have my first gyne
cological exam she had to help me onto the exam table and she
stayed in the room and everything So in a way she had control
because she had to be there if I wanted to receive care Similarly
another young woman living with multiple sclerosis was accom
panied to her appointments by her mother While she wanted to
ask her healthcare provider about family planning options she was
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
not comfortable doing so in front of her mother remarking so I
guess that was definitely a barrier I couldn t get the information I
needed and that s how I ended up pregnant Similar experiences
were described by multiple other participants that is wanting to
have open conversations with health care providers but in private
without a family member present
Financial limitations often times I don t come up with the money
Over half of study participants reported significant financial
challenges which also presented barriers to obtaining recom
mended reproductive health care As one participant said
another thing is the cost of these medications If you want an IUD
it s very expensive so and who knows how the insurance is going to
change when it comes to birth control Financial barriers led
another participant to use a less effective birth control methods
i e withdrawal She remarked I m sexually active and well I
haven t gone through her yet because I do have a co pay to go see
her and often times I don t come up with the money to see her
Similarly another woman reported becoming pregnant soon after
giving birth when she could not afford to attend her six week
checkup More than half of study participants reported living on
per year total household income and as one participant
stated when it comes to choosing groceries or co pays I have to
choose food A substantial number of participants also identified
obstacles including significant delays in finding a healthcare pro
vider who could attend to their reproductive health needs given
their disability Participants perceived these delays were exacer
bated by a shortage of health care providers who accepted their
insurance i e Medicaid One participant who had recently moved
to a new town described significant delays in attempting to obtain
an intrauterine device She recalled by the time I found someone
who was comfortable treating me living with spinal cord injury
they saw me and said I needed to come back to have the IUD ve
always felt like having Medicaid and this disability is it s like a
double whammy She went on to describe feeling judged in
many of her encounters with the health care system due to
Medicaid and that having Medicaid limited her options in health
care providers who were willing to care for her This experience of
feeling judged based upon payer status was shared by several other
participants Ultimately she experienced an unintended pregnancy
due to delays in finding a healthcare provider with whom she was
comfortable receiving care
Healthcare providers it was the silence around the topic that was
most telling
All participants were asked about their experiences with
healthcare providers in discussing and accessing family planning
options to prevent an unintended pregnancy While few partici
pants were actively discouraged from being sexually active by
healthcare providers many perceived that their providers were
highly reluctant to raise the issue during the health care
appointment Some participants found healthcare providers quick
to assume that they were not in need of contraception as adoles
cents One participant with a physical disability recounted seeing
her family physician before she went to college and her mother
being in the exam room She described the encounter with her
physician recalling she was like going down this checklist and I
remember her clicking through and going well you re not sexually
active so that s a no Most of the participants who were older and
in some cases had already experienced an unintended pregnancy
reported that their providers also failed to address the topic Par
ticipants very clearly felt this was due to their disability As one
participant said It s the truth She provider absolutely didn t talk
Disability and Health Journal
to me about it because of my disability Another said I guess she
didn t talk about contraception because of my disability She had
seen me for like the last five years and it never came up It was like
that whole section was just skipped over Some participants dis
cussed having never had a sexual history taken or had a provider
ask about their family planning needs A participant who used a
wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury noted no one ever asked if I
wanted to be pregnant or if I didn t want to be pregnant Another
participant who was Deaf remarked I did go to a GYN almost every
year because I knew I was supposed to but it was never brought
up Participants often attributed this to a view of women with
disability as asexual A participant living with multiple sclerosis
remarked persons with disabilities are special but not in special
way People don t think we re interested in sex or maybe it s that
who would be interested in having sex with me A participant
with a spinal cord injury described her experience in discussing
family planning options noting it was more like she didn t believe
because I have a disability that I could have intercourse So she
wasn t too worried about it even though I actually expressed my
concerns about it she was definitely dismissive Another added
there was also this underlying assumption that it contraception
was only to help with my periods like I d never need it for birth
control that question never ever came up Yeah no one has ever
asked me if I was sexually active
When asked what they knew about contraception prior to
experiencing an unintended pregnancy participants reported a
range of knowledge and any unique considerations given their
specific disability For those participants who were older some
described being placed in separate classrooms as school aged
children for the birds and the bees talk now recounting that the
discussions were more focused on anatomy than anything else
Younger participants described largely turning to family friends or
social media for information Overall participants felt supported in
their discussions with family and friends and rarely were partici
pants discouraged from being sexually active or using contracep
tion Those who were discouraged from using contraception as
adolescents or young adults n
were most commonly
discouraged because of concerns from family members about po
tential side effects of varied methods With few exceptions the
majority of participants did not receive information during
adolescence and young adulthood about reproductive health care
needs from a health care provider unless they initiated the
conversation
Finding what works for me
The second major theme was related to difficulties participants
experienced in finding family planning options that worked for
their individual needs
Like women without disabilities many participants struggled to
find a family planning method that worked for them and that they
liked The information under this theme reflects those struggles
and the factors that influenced participants experience with family
planning including side effects and problems with methods both
unrelated and related to disability Many participants perceived
providers were often not helpful in providing them with guidance
in navigating their challenges with methods
Women with disabilities in this study often encountered the
same kinds of challenges with contraception that women without
disabilities typically report For example participants experienced
side effects like weight gain mood swings or diminished sex drive
from hormonal methods or had difficulty remembering to take oral
contraceptives For some typical side effects e g fatigue dimin
ished desire were particularly difficult to manage in the context of
disabilities that were already causing such symptoms For others
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
the side effects impacted them more severely because of their
disabilities One participant shared The reason I was concerned
about my weight gain with different options was because of my
disability I struggle with mobility as it is and so I have to really be
careful about anything that could cause me to gain weight it
would wear on my shoulders to push myself if I got heavier and
transferring would be harder Many had to try multiple methods
because of side effects that were more problematic given their
disability One participant with a physical disability noted I got on
the pill and I did fine until I d been on it for about six months and I
noticed I started gaining weight having horrible headaches having
horrible mood swings and it was just awful and I couldn t tolerate
it and so we tried a diaphragm later I had decided to get my
tubes tied because I did have one abortion and it haunted me
For some participants their specific disabilities affected their
physiologic responses to contraception thus limiting their options
For example one participant with a genetic metabolic condition
reported an idiosyncratic reaction to an injectable contraceptive
that caused her to gain a large amount of weight and resulted in
hospitalization Participants with mobility issues e g paraplegia
were unable to safely use hormonal methods due to poor circula
tion and an increased risk of blood clots One participant described
her challenges when her provider recommended a NuvaRing given
her concerns of not wanting something she had to take every day
She remarked I couldn t use the ring because I can t bend with my
back to insert that in and I know people who have mobility issues
that bending to insert that would be impossible for them too
Several participants described wanting to explore an intrauterine
device IUD as an option given their desire for menstrual man
agement or suppression as well as desire for a method without
estrogen due to its association with an increased risk for throm
bosis Participants with mobility limitations described not being
able to tolerate the positioning required for IUD insertion yet op
tions to have this done under anesthesia were not discussed
Several participants with weakness or limited use in their upper
or lower extremities felt their options were quite limited and did
not perceive providers to be sensitive to these needs The providers
often offered little information and few options leaving partici
pants to feel they had been left alone to identify alternatives when a
particular method did not work for them As one said it s almost
like it was my problem to deal with not theirs Another participant
with a cognitive disability remarked that she had difficulty
remembering to take her birth control pills When she broached the
topic with her provider she said she didn t offer anything She told
me for it to be effective I needed to take it every day which I knew
but just wasn t good at remembering I knew there might be some
other options but it was this is your option take it or leave it
Another participant with a physical disability reported it was like
she wasn t interested in talking about it She had made her
recommendation and it didn t work so that was that Minimizing
menstruation was a particularly important consideration for par
ticipants with limited mobility One participant who self
catheterized hoped that minimizing her periods would decrease
her frequent urinary tract infections Another reported periods
were also harder for me because I can t stand to clean myself up and
so absolutely I was looking for an option that would not make me
gain weight and that would cut back on my bleeding substantially
Discussion
The reproductive health needs of women living with disabilities
have largely been ignored
Unintended pregnancy is regarded
as a key indicator of women s autonomy and control over their
reproductive health and is a marker widely used in policy and
program planning Limited research demonstrates that rates of
Disability and Health Journal
unintended pregnancy are higher among women with disabilities
who are also disproportionately poor less educated and racial and
ethnic minorities reflecting both historical harms and existing
inequities
The barriers that women with disabilities face in accessing
family planning are substantial In this study most participants
identified the combination of financial restriction and health in
surance limitations as a barrier to accessing optimal reproductive
services and family planning options Overcoming this inequity
barrier will involve solutions such as greater employment oppor
tunities equal pay and attitudinally and physically accessible work
environments for women with disabilities as well as comprehen
Sive health insurance reform Many of our participants also
described physical barriers which either precluded or delayed ac
cess to care Improving access to care will require elimination of
such barriers A study examining physical access barriers found that
of gynecological practices were deemed inaccessible to women
with disabilities Despite the passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act thirty years ago women with disabilities continue
to experience barriers in accessibility Many of our participants
discussed examination tables being a limiting factor to care The
U S Access Board established standards for accessible equipment
including adjustable height examination tables yet widespread
adoption of these standards has not occurred Women living with
disability are more likely to be poor and many of the participants in
this study had Medicaid While Medicaid is meant to increase ac
cess to care for participants in this study it was often perceived as
yet another barrier Other research in women without disabil
ities has found that Medicaid recipients often experience
Stigma is associated with less utilization of preventa
stigma
tive care delays in seeking care and lower quality of care
While the experience of stigma was not a central purpose of the
current study our findings suggest it may be an important risk
factor for unintended pregnancy for women living with disability of
reproductive age
Beyond physical and financial barriers women experienced
negative and nonresponsive encounters with healthcare providers
many of whom treated them with negative attitudes or frank
dismissal of their reproductive health care needs and parenting
desires The large majority noted that discussions around fertility
desires occurred only if the women raised the issue and even then
some women felt judged In a qualitative study of pregnant
women with physical disabilities women perceived being treated
as less than normal and in some cases feeling viewed as a
problem by their clinicians A patient centered approach is key
to optimizing reproductive choices It is important for clinicians to
recognize that women with disabilities are fully sexual beings with
the same range of fertility and parenting desires and concerns as
their able bodied peers Addressing sexuality and contraception is
an essential part of the clinical encounter This is particularly salient
for women with disabilities who have been historically regarded as
asexual
Assessing fertility goals and contraceptive counseling are dis
cussions that must occur in a patient centered approach to opti
mizing reproductive choices
Engaging women in such
discussions is increasingly recognized as key public health strategy
to decrease rates of unintended pregnancy Indeed the American
Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG along with a
number for health care organizations advocates for reproductive
life planning in health care settings recognizing its role in
reducing unintended pregnancy improving maternal health and
pregnancy outcomes
Family planning presents unique considerations for women
living with disabilities Despite recent research showing the ther
apeutic benefit and safety of levonorgestrel IUD use in young adults

IN SPRING the pandemic began shutting
down the world restaurants colleges even entire
cities felt emptied and closed A cloud of uncertainty
lingered over most parts of the world and altered our
daily schedules and tasks But for a wide segment of
society it wasn t the toilet paper or the masks or the
isolation from their families that hurt the worst it
was the sudden uncertainty around one of the most
fundamental aspects of our lives reproduction
Quite suddenly with the onset of the pandemic
this process already fraught with dangers and ques
tions and challenges became infinitely more so
Hard data was already scarce in an active novel
pandemic and for pregnancy even more so In
some cases the answer became delay or cancel any
family plans Birth rates already on the decrease
abruptly plummeted in the United States According
to a recent survey by the Guttmacher Institute
of American women have either delayed their plans
to have a child or reduced the number of children

Making babies
One of the more intriguing questions about the
COVID pandemic is the fact that from the start it
has hit men harder than women Maleness is in fact
the leading risk factor for both contracting the virus
and developing severe illness once infected This
is due to the prevalence a protein found on
the surface of many types of cells that acts as the
receptor for COVID s spike protein Though
is found in both men and women a lot of it is found
in the testes more in fact than in any other organ
male or female That has reproductive health
specialists concerned that the virus might impact
sperm production In fact COVID s viral
cousin SARS or SARS CoV is known to cause wide
spread damage to both the sperm and testes when it
invades causing severe inflammation and cell death
and aside from that it isn t unusual for sperm
production to suffer during a fever inducing illness
Sarah Vij a urological surgeon and male fertility
specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland OH
said that recently ill men are routinely advised not to
undergo fertility treatments due to inevitable drops
in sperm counts Figure Anecdotally she said
I ve seen two patients
and my partner has seen
one who were recover
ing or recently infected
with COVID who had no
sperm in their ejaculate
she said but it s unclear
whether or not this is a
prolonged issue or merely
temporary The data sim
ply do not exist to suggest
either way

Similar increases have been seen throughout the
world The massive influx of severely ill COVID
patients has also pushed pregnant women in these
areas out of the hospital limiting their access to
critical prenatal care leading to thousands of
deaths that would have been avoided under differ
ent circumstances
Protecting babies
Early in the pandemic it was unclear if women
could transmit the virus to their babies during
pregnancy or at birth Perhaps out of an overabun
dance of caution the initial policy in China was for
a newborn to be immediately removed from a COV
ID mother and then kept in isolation for as long as
days without breastmilk That draconian process
was not something any of us wanted to replicate
said Puopolo but we were in an evidence free zone
Prior to the pandemic Puopolo had been work
ing on a study investigating immunity transfer from
mother to child for Group B Streptococcus one of
the leading causes of sepsis in newborns By com
paring antibody levels in the umbilical cord blood of
newborns to those in the mother s blood they could
get a pretty good idea of the rate of transfer from the
mother through the placenta When the pandemic
hit it was easy to adjust their protocol to test for
those antibodies instead As newborn providers
we wanted a way to tell a woman she doesn t have to
worry anymore she said if you have to tell a family
with a new baby that everybody has to wear a mask
and wash their hands and nobody can come over
and nobody can help you take care of that baby
there are a lot of really terrible practical implications
of this virus for pregnant women in new families
They also hoped that with the rapid development of
vaccines this might help them get a general idea as
to whether properly timing a vaccine during preg
nancy might help confer immunity to the fetus
Puopolo and her colleagues collected blood from
mothers and their baby s umbilical cords and
tested them both for antibodies Eighty three of the
mothers tested positive for COVID antibodies and
of their babies showed antibody levels at least
as high or higher than their mothers What our
work established was that these antibodies are trans
ferred they appear to be transferred with a timing
that is relatively rapid relative to when the woman
gets the disease said Puopolo And furthermore
the data suggest that the earlier a mother is infected
July August
the greater the transfer of
The data suggest
antibodies to the fetus
that the earlier a
though further studies are
mother is infected
needed to determine these
the greater the trans
precise dynamics This
fer of antibodies to
hints that there may very
the fetus
well be an optimal time to
vaccinate the mother Of course this isn t the only
thing an obstetrician has to think about when coun
seling a patient said Puopolo but we now at least
have some information to provide to care providers
about the best time during pregnancy to immunize
This presumes a pregnant mother even can get
immunized Vaccine safety in pregnant women has
been slow to come That s because historically preg
nant women have long been excluded from clinical
trials to protect both mother and child from ill effects
Sadly in the case of the pandemic this left one of
the most vulnerable populations without basic safety
information Fortunately that is all finally beginning to
change Formal clinical studies with pregnant women
for both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are cur
rently underway and preliminary data on more than
people showed no obvious safety issues from
those vaccines in pregnant women It remains
unclear if other vaccines particularly those that are
more widely available outside of the United States
like Covishield from AstraZeneca and Covaxin are
safe for pregnant women leaving many expectant
mothers at risk
Life prevails
If there can be said to be a gift in this pandemic it
is in how relatively less it affects children and that so
far has appeared to extend to infants born over the last
year Though there have been documented cases of
newborns being infected after birth the CDC and the
American Academy of Pediatrics say this is unlikely
Only of newborns test positive for the virus in
the few days after birth and those that do don t get
especially sick Generally all of them are born to moth
ers who are acutely ill and likely weren t sick enough
during pregnancy to pass along immunity
When I think back to how worried we were at the
beginning of the pandemic said Valerie Flaherman
associate professor of Pediatrics and Epidemiology
and Biostatistics at the University of California San
Francisco Medical Center Figure there were
so many things about COVID that were difficult to
understand and we were all really worried the babies

would have a lot of deleterious impacts Flaherman
in a study looking at babies born to infected women
found that in general the babies did well But she
said we have yet to see comprehensive data from
babies born to women infected early in pregnancy
Other viruses like Zika and Rubella are known to
cause severe birth defects and perhaps even cog
nitive behavioral and psychiatric disorders that
may not be obvious until later in life Most of
the time said Puopolo the issues with all of these
viruses occur during a very narrow period early in
pregnancy where there s very rapid organ develop
ment in the baby It s still too early to know if the virus
is capable of similar effects something Flaherman is
currently investigating
THOUGH MUCH HAS been learned in these pandem
ic laden months there are still merely hints and clues
about the effects of COVID on reproductive health
And for some there is no time to waste My experi
ence is when it comes to fertility patients do not want
to wait said Vij Her practice never really slowed
down even at the height of the pandemic

BACKGROUND The relationship between gestational diabetes mel
litus and adverse outcomes in multifetal pregnancies is complex and
controversial Moreover limited research has focused on the risk of
gestational diabetes mellitus progression to type diabetes mellitus
specifically in multifetal pregnancies resulting in conflicting results from
existing studies
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the risk of gestational diabetes

STUDY DESIGN A retrospective study was conducted on a pro
spective cohort of pregnant individuals with pregnancies between January
and December followed up to years after delivery
Glucose levels during pregnancy were obtained from the Meuhedet Health
Maintenance Organization laboratory system and cross linked with the
Israeli National Diabetes Registry The cohort was divided into groups
singleton pregnancy without gestational diabetes mellitus singleton
pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus multifetal pregnancy without
gestational diabetes mellitus and multifetal pregnancy with gestational
diabetes mellitus Gestational diabetes mellitus was defined according to
the American Diabetes Association criteria using the step strategy
Univariate analyses followed by survival analysis that included Kaplan
Meier hazard curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used
to assess differences between groups and calculate the adjusted hazard
ratios with confidence intervals for progression to type diabetes
mellitus
RESULTS Among parturients cases met the inclusion
criteria The prevalence of type diabetes mellitus was in the
singleton pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group and in
the multifetal pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group Partu
rients with gestational diabetes mellitus regardless of plurality were older
and had higher fasting plasma glucose levels in the first trimester of
pregnancy The rates of increased body mass index hypertension and
earlier gestational age at delivery were significantly higher in the gesta
tional diabetes mellitus group among patients with singleton pregnancies
but not among patients with multifetal pregnancies Survival analysis
demonstrated that gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with
adjusted hazard ratios of type diabetes mellitus of confidence

prevalence of obesity and advanced

risks such as accelerated fetal growth
and macrosomia and long term risks
such as the potential development of
metabolic syndrome
The incidence of GDM in multifetal
pregnancies is higher than in singleton
pregnancies probably because of
increased placental mass and placental
hormone levels However the associa

outcomes in multifetal pregnancies is
complex and conflicting GDM compli

Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to evaluate the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus GDM
progression to type diabetes mellitus between singleton and multifetal
pregnancies in a large cohort of parturients with a year follow up
Key findings
The prevalence of was in the singleton pregnancy with GDM group
and in the multifetal pregnancy with GDM group GDM doubled the risk of
progression to in singleton pregnancies compared with multifetal preg
nancies adjusted hazard ratio vs P OOI for both Stratified analysis
based on obesity status revealed that in pregnant individuals without obesity
GDM elevated risk by in singleton pregnancies and insignificantly
elevated risk in multifetal pregnancies However in pregnant individuals
with obesity GDM raised risk by in singleton pregnancies and in
multifetal pregnancies
What does this add to what is known
This study unveils the complex effect of GDM in multifetal pregnancies In
pregnant individuals without obesity who carry multifetal pregnancy GDM did
not substantially increase the risk of progression to raising a possible need
to individualize the diagnostic criteria and glucose target levels for GDM in
multifetal pregnancies Conversely the risk was Considerably higher in
pregnant individuals with obesity who carry multifetal pregnancies and develop
GDM than in pregnant individuals with obesity who carry singleton pregnancies
and develop GDM suggesting that this population may require special attention
and follow up after delivery to facilitate early diagnosis of
protective role potentially reducing the
risk of placental insufficiency and fetal
growth restriction in multifetal pregnan
cies This implies that GDM treatment in
multifetal pregnancies may not improve
neonatal outcomes
The pathophysiology of GDM is
thought to involve preclinical prepreg
nancy pancreatic cell dysfunction
which in turn accounted for the
higher risk of developing type diabetes
mellitus after delivery
Therefore pregnant individuals with
GDM are recommended to undergo a
postpartum glucose tolerance test GTT
and subsequent follow up In multifetal
pregnancies the pathophysiology of
GDM is uncertain Although some sug
gest that increased GDM is due to
increased placental mass leading to
higher levels of diabetogenic hormones
such as human placental lactogen and
steroidal hormones others contend
that the diabetogenic effect of hyper
placentosis in multifetal pregnancies is
counterbalanced by greater glucose up
take of the increased fetal mass This
perspective presents GDM as somewhat
physiological in multifetal pregnancies
Moreover data on the risk after
GDM is conflicting with only a few
studies comparing the progression
of GDM to in singleton vs mul
tifetal pregnancies yielding opposing
results
If the risk of progression to
is similar to that of singleton
pregnancies this supports the idea that
GDM even in multifetal pregnancies is
pathologic
Thus this study aimed to evaluate the
risk of GDM progression to be
tween singleton and multifetal preg
nancies in a large cohort of parturients
with a year follow up

Comment
Principal findings of the study
Here we aimed to compare the risk of
GDM progression to between
singleton and multifetal pregnancies
Our main findings were as follows
l Compared with GDM in singleton
pregnancies GDM in multifetal
pregnancies doubles the overall risk
of developing within years
In parturients without obesity GDM
in singleton pregnancies increases the
risk of developing in years
by whereas in multifetal preg
nancies GDM does not elevate this
risk significantly
For parturients with obesity we
observed that GDM in multifetal
pregnancies resulted in a times
higher risk of developing than
GDM in singleton pregnancies
Results in the context of other
studies
Few studies have evaluated the associa
tion between GDM and adverse out
comes in multifetal pregnancies yielding
conflicting
results
More specifically to the best of our
knowledge the progression of GDM to
in multifetal pregnancies was
addressed in only studies
Hiersch
et al evaluated g OGTT results for
singleton and twin pregnancies and
showed that the incidence of was
lower for pregnant individuals with a
twin pregnancy for any given OGTT
value indirectly suggesting that GDM in
twins was less associated with
Similarly using a large Canadian data
base Retnakaran et demonstrated
that the risk of GDM progression to
was lower in pregnant individuals
with twin pregnancies than in those with
singleton pregnancies Conversely Cai
mari et al demonstrated similar rates of
GDM progression to impaired glucose
ajog org
tolerance or between singleton
and multifetal pregnancies The dis
crepancies between our study results and
those of Hiersch and Retnakaran could
be attributed to several factors First
both Hiersch and Retnakaran employed
a g OGTT Previous research has
indicated that the use of a g OGTT
leads to a fold increase in the diagnosis
of GDM while maintaining a similar rate
of adverse outcomes This may lead to
overdiagnosis of GDM in their cohorts
which could potentially have a substan
tial effect on the study results Caimari
et used g OGTT but with the
National Diabetes Data Group criteria
Second we conducted separate analyses
for singleton and multifetal pregnancies
employing a multivariate approach that
adjusted for potential confounders Un
like the studies by Hiersch and Retna
karan our cohort was stratified for
maternal BMI which differed from
previous studies a factor we found to
have a substantial role in the progression
of GDM to in multifetal preg
nancies This distinction is noteworthy
particularly when considering that in the
study by Caimari et al where the me
dian BMI was kg and similar to
our findings the authors did not observe
a significant difference in the progres
Sion of GDM to in pregnant in
dividuals without obesity
Clinical implications
Our study demonstrates that the risk of
GDM progression to is doubled
in multifetal pregnancies with GDM
compared with singleton pregnancies

considered physiological Consistent
with studies showing a higher rate of
small for gestational age fetuses in well
controlled GDM in multifetal pregnan
cies and considering the fact that the
studies by Carpenter Coustan excluded
multifetal pregnancies these findings
suggest a possible need to individualize
the diagnostic criteria and glucose target
levels for GDM in multifetal pregnancies
Conversely although it is well estab
lished that pregnant individuals with
GDM have a high risk of progression to
after delivery it seems that
pregnant individuals with obesity who
carry multifetal pregnancies and develop
GDM represent a special population
with an even higher risk of DM in the
future This heightened risk may be
attributed to a combination of risk
factors including advanced maternal
age polycystic ovary syndrome and the
need for assisted reproductive tech
niques with increased estrogen levels all
linked to both multifetal pregnancies
and In parturients with obesity
excessive adiposity may promote a
proinflammatory state and insulin
resistance which contribute to both
GDM development and later
Previous studies that evaluated combi
nations of risk factors and future DM
demonstrated that GDM alone had a
comparable risk of such as hav
ing risk factors such as obesity or
postdelivery weight retention Hence
we suggest that pregnant individuals
with obesity and multifetal pregnancies
complicated by GDM may require
tailored postpartum interventions
including access to dietitians regular
follow ups and for those at the highest
risk options such as metformin or
bariatric surgery to facilitate early diag
nosis of
Research implications
The first research implication is the need
to develop OGTT thresholds for the
diagnosis of GDM in multifetal preg
nancies based on the risk of developing

these thresholds will need to be evalu

individuals underscoring the substantial
diversity within our study population
The results were adjusted for multiple
confounders including maternal BMI
This adjustment is particularly impor
tant as BMI plays a crucial role in the
progression to and postpartum
care and pregnant individuals with
obesity are advised to undergo DM
screening irrespective of their history of
GDM status Our data are based on an
automatic laboratory database cross
tabulated with a validated daily upda
ted pregnancy registry integrated with
the INDR Last we used only preg
nancy per patient which prevents se
lection bias for high parity parturients
Study limitations mainly derive from
its retrospective nature Several key fac
tors were absent from our dataset
including maternal parity family history
of DM hyperlipidemia and gestational
weight gain In addition data on po
tential postpartum interventions such
as weight loss or bariatric surgeries were
not available for analysis The absence of
parity data along with our strategy to
include each woman only once in the
analysis limited our ability to assess the
potential influence of multifetal
pregnancy exposure as a confounding
factor Regrettably we did not perform a
power analysis before commencing the
research and the registry that we used
had a limited existence of only years
lacking long term data beyond that
period Although our initial cohort was
large it is essential to note that only a
small subset of pregnant individuals with
multifetal pregnancies were affected by
GDM potentially influencing our sta
tistical results Statistical significance
should be interpreted cautiously
considering the sample size variation
between groups
In addition our study is limited by the
INDR s lack of differentiation between
type I DM and Recent research in
Israel highlighted this nonspecificity and
although the effect of type DM on our
results is expected to be minimal it re
mains a limitation The registry s reli
ance on the criterion of purchases of
glucose lowering medications to indicate
is another inherent limitation
Although this criterion has a high sensi
tivity and positive predictive value it may
not definitively distinguish DM related
use from other indications Previous
studies evaluating the reliability of the
registry have reported a sensitivity of
and a positive predictive value of
Moreover the inclusion criteria
restricted our study to patients with live
births potentially affecting the results
The inclusion of triplet pregnancies
although few and without cases of DM is
another aspect to consider Finally our
study was conducted in one of Israel s
HMOs which may raise concerns about
the generalizability of our results How
ever it is crucial to recognize that all
citizens regardless of ethnicity or reli
gious affiliation are mandated to be

wide presence and the freedom for
citizens to switch between HMOs
contribute to maintaining a broadly

hancing the potential applicability of our
findings to a broader context

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with pregnancy complications and reduced fetal
growth in populations where total arsenic exposure exceeds gg L However the potential effect on pregnancy
outcomes remains unclear at lower levels of arsenic exposure such as those most commonly observed in the
United States
Objectives We evaluated the associations between arsenic exposure during pregnancy with fetal growth and risk
of pregnancy complications using data from mother infant pairs participating in the National Children s Study
Methods Prenatal arsenic exposure was measured using maternal urine collected during the third trimester
Information about pregnancy complications was abstracted from medical records Fetal growth including ge
stational age birth weight birth length head circumference and ponderal index was ascertained through
physical measurement at birth and extracted from medical records
Results Medians interquartile range IQR of maternal urinary total arsenic and dimethylarsinic acid DMA
were gg L and gg L respectively Each increase in IQR of prenatal total arsenic level was
associated with greater birth length cm CI greater head circumference cm
CI and lower ponderal index kg CI Similar results were
obtained for levels of prenatal DMA Tests for multiplicative interaction indicate that prenatal urinary DMA was
negatively associated with gestational age among female infants week decrease in gestational age es
timated for each IQR increase in DMA CI while no association was observed among male
infants p
No significant associations were detected between arsenic and birth weight or
i nterac tio n
pregnancy complications
Conclusions Higher prenatal arsenic exposure was associated with longer birth length greater head cir
cumference and lower ponderal index Associations between arsenic and gestational age may be modified by
infant sex
Naturally occurring arsenic in the earth s crust leads to widespread
human exposure Arsenic contaminated drinking water is the major
pathway of exposure Chung et al but arsenic exposure through
occupation diet and air pollution can also lead to clinically significant
exposure in populations with no known water exposure Bulka et al
Chronic exposure to arsenic is linked with
Meharg et al
numerous detrimental health outcomes including cancers skin lung
liver bladder kidney and prostate skin lesions cardiovascular dis
ease respiratory disease and diabetes mellitus Abdul et al
Mauli et al Moon et al
Rahman et al

Sanchez et al
Pregnant women and their offspring may be particularly susceptible
to the toxic effects of arsenic exposure due to changes in hormone levels
of pregnant women and hemodynamics associated with pregnancy and
the immature immune system rapid differentiation and tissue organ
growth of developing fetuses Cunningham et al
While it is
known that arsenic exposure to a pregnant woman transfers to the
developing fetus

there is
growing consensus among the existing evidence to indicate that arsenic
exposure affects fetal growth Four recent systematic reviews evaluated

evidence for an effect
of arsenic exposure on birth length head circumference and ponderal
index is inconclusive Similarly arsenic exposure may exert a role in the
development of pregnancy complications e g gestational diabetes and
preeclampsia Farzan et al Marie et al Peng et al
which in turn may increase later life risks of adverse health
outcomes such as type diabetes and cardiometabolic disease Baz
et al Bellamy et al Chen et al Murphy and Smith
However epidemiologic research evaluating these associations
is limited
Most previous epidemiologic studies on arsenic exposure and ma
ternal and child health were performed in populations with higher le
vels of arsenic exposure such as those found in Bangladesh and Mexico
Laine et al A Rahman et al Few studies have evaluated
these relationships in regions e g United States and Canada with
lower levels of water arsenic Ettinger et al Gilbert Diamond
et al Although the public health implications are large it re
mains unclear whether results based on populations receiving high
level arsenic exposures are relevant to populations receiving low or
moderate level arsenic exposures
Here we sought to understand the impacts of arsenic exposure
during pregnancy on fetal growth and risk of pregnancy complications
in a population of pregnant women with levels of exposure that are
typical in the United States using data from a cohort of mother infant
pairs who participated in the National Children s Study NCS
Methods
Study population
Participants included for analysis are women and children enrolled
in the Initial Vanguard Study of the NCS Information regarding re
cruitment of women is detailed elsewhere
Stanford et al The
Initial Vanguard Study was conducted in seven primary sampling units
i e Queens County New York Montgomery County Pennsylvania
Waukesha County Wisconsin Brookings County South Dakota and
Yellow Medicine Pipestone and Lincoln counties Minnesota Orange
County California Salt Lake County Utah Duplin County North
Carolina using a geographically based probability sample design from
January September According to estimates from the United
States Geological Survey the groundwater in each of these counties is
estimated to contain less than the US Environmental Protection Agency
EPA limit of gg L of arsenic
Ayotte et al EPA
In order to be included in the study the following eligibility criteria
needed to be met household screening performed during or before the
woman s pregnancy current pregnancy or high probability of preg
nancy and ability to grant informed consent mother infant pairs
met these criteria and were enrolled in the study Enrolled women
completed up to two pregnancy visits that consisted of extensive in
terview self administered questionnaires a physical examination and
biospecimen blood and urine and environmental sample collections
Since the purpose of the Initial Vanguard Study was to test study
procedures and feasibilities many changes were made over the course
of the year study period Specifically changes to the data collection
protocols led to only a subset of mother infant pairs with all study
variables collected Of the mother infant pairs pairs without
Y H etaL
missing data were included to evaluate the association between birth
outcome and DMA and pairs without missing data were included
in relation to total arsenic For adverse health outcomes during preg
nancy and women without missing data were included to
investigate the association with DMA and total arsenic respectively

each analysis
Assessment of prenatal arsenic exposure
A spot urine sample was collected during the third trimester from a
subset of participants Urine was collected into a pre screened metal
free container and was frozen locally until shipment on dry ice to the
NCS Repository Fisher Bioservices Rockville MD Urine was ali
quoted into pre screened metal free cryovials and stored at oc
until shipment on dry ice to the US Centers for Disease Control s
National Center for Environmental Health Since the initial purpose of
laboratory testing of the Initial Vanguard Study was operational quality
control assessment urine samples were selected for measuring total
arsenic and arsenic species based on availability across study sites
without any additional criteria Further experiments for total arsenic
and arsenic species were administered at different time points resulting
in different sample sizes available for the analyses in the current study
Urinary total arsenic concentration was measured by inductively cou
pled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry ICP DRC MS
with a limit of detection LOD of gg L Concentrations of urinary
arsenic species were measured using high performance liquid chroma
tography HPLC coupled to ICP DRC MS The LODs were as follows
arsenic acid gg L arsenobetaine gg L arsenocholine gg
L arsenous acid gg L DMA gg L MMA gg L and
trimethylarsine oxide gg L For analytical results below the LOD an
imputed value equivalent to the LOD divided by the square root of two
was assigned Here total arsenic gg L and DMA
gg L were analyzed as main exposure variables since a
significant percentage of samples had concentrations of other
metabolites i e arsenic acid arsenobetaine arsenocholine arsenous
acid MMA and trimethylarsine oxide below the LOD
Assessment of outcomes
The NCS protocol included physical examination of children at
birth Birth length cm and head circumference cm were measured
twice and the average of the two readings was used For offspring
without measures of length n and head circumference n
values were abstracted from medical records using Community Health
Information Architecture CHITA instruments Birth weight was not
measured during the physical exam and was therefore extracted from
medical records Ponderal index an indicator of infant adiposity is a
measure of in utero growth retardation
Vintzileos et al Yagel
Thus we derived ponderal index by dividing birth weight

in kilograms by cubed birth length in meters kg Gestational age

To test for linear trends by quartile of exposure p values were ob

peating the above analyses Previous studies suggested potential sex
specific effects of arsenic exposure on birth outcomes Cooperstock and
Campbell Gilbert Diamond et al Zeitlin et al
thus multivariable regression models with cross product terms be

Discussion
We assessed the impact of prenatal arsenic exposure measured from
maternal urine at the third trimester on the risk of complications during
pregnancy as well as birth outcomes using a sample of mother infant
pairs from the US based NCS Prenatal exposure to total arsenic as well
as DMA was positively associated with birth length and head cir
cumference and negatively associated with ponderal index Our results
from analyses evaluating effect modification by infant sex further found
a negative association between concentration of DMA and gestational
age only among female infants Maternal urinary arsenic at the third
trimester was not significantly associated with birth weight or com
plications during pregnancy Given the rigorous study design good
exposure metric i e urinary arsenic biomarker and critical exposure
time window selected this study adds valuable information to current
evidence on the impact of low level prenatal arsenic exposure on birth
outcomes
A positive relationship between arsenic exposure and birth length
was previously observed in a large prospective cohort study conducted
in New Hampshire of mother infant pairs with similar levels of
arsenic exposure Gilbert Diamond et al That study reported a
cm and cm increase in birth length in relation to each unit
increase in log transformed prenatal DMA and total arsenic con
centrations respectively measured from maternal urine at the second
trimester Further the study demonstrated that a positive association
between arsenic exposure and birth length was primarily driven by
male infants Six other prospective studies evaluated this relationship

no significant association was found in five of the studies conducted in
Bangladesh Romania Mexico and Taiwan Bloom et al Chou
et al Laine et al Liao et al A Rahman et al
while a study in a Chinese population reported a negative as
sociation between urinary arsenic exposure and birth length Liu et al
The potential for arsenic to enhance birth length and subse
quently ponderal index may be attributable to effects on bone devel
opment An in vitro study suggested that arsenic trioxide an oxide of
arsenic exerts different effects on osteoblast growth based on the given
dosage
Xu et al while high dose of arsenic trioxide and
gM induced apoptosis of osteoblasts results demonstrated a sig
nificantly enhanced viability of cultured osteoblasts as well as increased
collagen synthesis following exposure to a low dose and
gM of arsenic trioxide Therefore the unexpected findings con
necting higher but still moderate arsenic exposure to longer birth
length may be related to this or a similar phenomenon
Our results linking higher arsenic exposure with greater head cir
cumference at birth are in contrast to existing evidence suggesting a
negative association Gilbert Diamond et al Henn et al
Liao et al A Rahman et al Specifically three pro
spective cohort studies conducted in Bangladesh and the US observed
significant associations of maternal urinary total arsenic and blood ar
senic levels with smaller head circumference Gilbert Diamond et al
Henn et al A Rahman et al
However multiple
other studies have reported null associations Bermudez et al
Bloom et al Chou et al Laine et al
Given the
inconsistencies with previous research and no apparent biological me
chanism the observed positive association between arsenic exposure
and head circumference in the current analysis might be spurious
Taken together these conflicting findings suggest that further research
is needed with a larger sample size and comprehensive measurement of
potential confounders
Our observed association with ponderal index represents only the
third study to examine this measure of possible intrauterine growth
restriction The previous research has been mixed with one study also
reporting that lower ponderal index is associated with maternal urinary
arsenic levels Gilbert Diamond et al and the other finding null
results overall but a significant positive association among female in
fants Bloom et al Future research investigating the effect of
arsenic on ponderal index and the potential interaction effect with sex
is still needed
Gestational age has been assessed as an outcome in multiple pre
vious studies of arsenic exposure Generally these past studies reported
a significant relationship between decreased gestational age and arsenic
exposure measured in drinking water maternal urine and maternal
blood
Henn et al Laine et al Xu et al
Specifi
cally a study conducted in China observed a negative association in
male but not female infants
Xu et al
In contrast we observed a
negative association between arsenic exposure and gestational age only
in female infants Differences in the exposure concentrations dietary or
behavioral practices or ancestry of the study samples may account for
the differences observed between these studies Although the evidence
connecting arsenic exposure to decreased gestational age is compelling
further confirmation by additional studies is needed to evaluate whe
ther effect modification of this association by infant sex is more widely
seen
While gestational age and birth weight are biologically related we
observed no significant association between prenatal arsenic exposure
and birth weight in the current study A systematic review published in
indicated that there is a convincing evidence on the association
between higher levels of arsenic exposure ppb and decreased
birth weight Further in a recent meta analysis using data from
studies prenatal arsenic exposure was significantly associated with
decreased birth weight and this observed negative association persisted
after restricting to studies in populations with lower levels of arsenic
exposure three US and one Chile
Zhong et al
However in a
Environmental Research
US prospective cohort study that is not included in the aforementioned
meta analysis no significant association was observed in relation to
birth weight Gilbert Diamond et al Although it is possible that
we had insufficient statistical power with the given sample to observe
an association between low level arsenic exposure and birth weight
further research in populations with lower levels of arsenic exposure is
still needed to evaluate this association
Previous literature on the association between arsenic exposure and
pregnancy complications is relatively limited and reports mixed find
ings possibly due to the heterogeneity of study designs and exposure
metrics used across studies While several studies have reported sig
nificant associations between arsenic exposure and preterm birth
Ahmad et al Almberg et al Huang et al Rahman
et al
others have observed no association
Kim et al
Myers et al No significant association with gestational diabetes
has been observed for drinking water arsenic and prenatal urinary ar
senic concentrations Bloom et al Gilbert Diamond et al
Yet studies that relied on maternal blood Ettinger et al Shapiro
et al maternal serum Xia et al maternal toenail
Farzan et al and drinking water Farzan et al Marie
et al
samples have shown significant associations of arsenic
exposure with increased risk of gestational diabetes or impaired glucose
tolerance no association was found in relation to maternal urinary
arsenic Farzan et al Two case control studies evaluated the
relationship between arsenic exposure and risk of preeclampsia re
porting no significant association Elongi Moyene et al
Sandoval Carrillo et al Our findings which used internal bio
markers of exposure are consistent with these previous findings sug
gesting no association between urinary arsenic and pregnancy compli
cations of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia Still the mixed
evidence underscores a need for further prospective studies assessing a
larger number of events
In this study two exposure variables i e total arsenic and DMA
were used to represent levels of arsenic exposure Total arsenic is a
mixture of organic and inorganic arsenic while DMA is one of the or
ganic metabolites after the methylation of inorganic arsenic Although
absolute value of DMA was used for the current analyses DMA con
centration may still imply two circumstances higher arsenic me
tabolism efficiency or higher inorganic arsenic exposure This may
explain the different findings in relation to total arsenic and DMA in our
sex stratified analyses In a study reporting results for the associations
of both total arsenic and DMA with birth outcomes findings were si
milar between total arsenic and DMA Gilbert Diamond et al
They also supported our findings of positive associations between DMA
and birth length as well as negative associations in relation to ponderal
index Further no significant association was found in relation to ar
senic methylation efficiency indices i e MMA inorganic arsenic and
DMA MMA with birth outcomes in the aforementioned study
The conclusions of this study could be strengthened by future re
search First the exposure assessment while an accurate biomarker of
arsenic exposure captures exposure during the third trimester only The
third trimester urine sample may reflect exposure after the time that is
most critical for developing pregnancy complications and potential
misclassification of prenatal arsenic exposure may exist due to the re
latively short half life of arsenic in urine Furthermore the laboratory
method used for measuring arsenobetaine in this study had a higher
LOD gg L as compared to some previous studies Gilbert Diamond
et al Laine et al
and of samples n had
arsenobetaine concentrations below the LOD Therefore the estimated
non seafood arsenic exposures used in the sensitivity analyses may not
be accurate We further compared the percentage below the LOD and
level of arsenobetaine between women in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES cycles and the
Supplemental Table Within the NHANES sample pregnant
NCS
women had lower mean arsenobetaine concentrations compared to
non pregnant women of child bearing age years of age Among

Abstract
We estimate that prenatal care has positive impacts on health measured at
birth shifts the distribution of future health care utilization away from
inpatient care and find that some of these impacts likely come from an
informational mechanism We also find well child visits are used in a com
plementary fashion with emergency department care in the production of
infant health suggesting that factors beyond barriers to access may drive the
demand for emergency care Finally we find differential impacts of prenatal
care across racial groups with evidence that the information mechanism may
be particularly important for black mothers

BACKGROUND
Poor health at birth generates substantial medical costs and is associated with subsequent health problems that extend
well into the future For instance infants born at low birth weight are statistically more likely to have lower educational
attainment lower wages and worse employment prospects compared to normal weight peers Almond et al
Behrman Rosenzweig Black et al Given the importance of early health it is important to understand
the underlying mechanisms and factors that impact birth outcomes Prenatal care as perhaps the earliest medical input
into child health deserves special attention Medical professionals emphasize the importance of prenatal care to both
monitor maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and to minimize potential risk factors Despite the common
perception that increased prenatal care should lead to more favorable health outcomes the current economic literature
provides confounding evidence as to the marginal impacts of prenatal care on infant health at birth and scant evidence
of any kind regarding the direct long run impacts of prenatal care on future well being
One major difficulty in identifying the causal effects of prenatal care arises from the decision to seek prenatal care itself
Unobservable maternal health characteristics and attitudes may simultaneously influence choices to seek prenatal care
and also have a direct effect on infant health making it difficult to isolate causal relationships While a majority of early

studies relied on ordinary least squares multivariate regressions more recent work has made efforts to account for the
potential endogeneity of prenatal care Evans and Lien exploit a disruption in public transportation due to a bus
strike in Pennsylvania as an instrument for prenatal care Despite statistically imprecise estimates they find that prenatal
visits missed in early pregnancy negatively impact birth weight while those missed later in pregnancy do not have affect
birth weight Currie and Grogger use expansions of the Medicaid program as an instrument and find prenatal care
reduces the incidence of very low birth weight among white mothers Sonchak uses Medicaid reimbursement rates
as an instrument and estimates that additional visits increase birth weight among white mothers but have no effect for
black mothers Broadly this strand of literature can be grouped into studies finding positive effects of prenatal care
Conway Deb Liu Liu et al Rosenzweig Schultz Yan those finding no effects
Jones Li Poirier and those finding only weak effects Currie Grogger Evans Lien Corman
et al also provide an excellent and more extensive review of the existing literature
To our knowledge and due to the difficulty of linking mothers across births only a few studies have utilized panel
data and maternal fixed effects to estimate the impacts of prenatal care Abrevaya and Dahl use data from
Washington and Arizona between and to study the effect of different inputs including smoking and prenatal
care on child health using quantile estimation Their results indicate a larger positive effect of prenatal care at the
bottom of the birth weight distribution Royer focuses on the effect of maternal age on prematurity and incidence
of low birth weight by using a panel of mothers from Texas More recently Balsa and Triunfo examine the
impact of prenatal care on infant birth weight among low income women in Uruguay and find prenatal care decreases
the likelihood of low birth weight and preterm birth Yan examines whether prenatal care has an effect on
maternal behaviors and maternal health including postpartum smoking premature rupture of membranes precipitous
labor breastfeeding and other outcomes and finds that early onset of prenatal care confers positive effects on maternal
health and behaviors Yan uses data from Pennsylvania and a similar study design to ours and finds that early
onset of prenatal care broadly improves an infant s stock of health capital None of these studies however utilize any
child health outcomes beyond those observable at the time of birth
In contrast to its impacts on infant health at birth there is very limited literature on any intermediate or longer run
impacts of prenatal care directly Freed et al and Kogan et al both find a positive association between
adequate and early initiation of prenatal care respectively on subsequent well child visits WCVs though neither study
accounts for the potential endogeneity of the decision to seek care In the economics literature Reichman et al
offer a theoretical framework that is quite similar to ours and estimate that prenatal care is associated with positive
changes in maternal postpartum behaviors and subsequent well child health care while Noonan et al investigate
the effects of prenatal care and find no impacts on four outcomes for children at age health status height weight and
asthma diagnosis Both studies use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study Despite accounting for a
rich set of covariates as well as controlling for state city and hospital indicators and performing a variety of robustness
checks these studies do not explicitly account for the potential endogeneity of prenatal care
Our study uses unique maternally linked birth data from Vital Statistics Natality files for the state of South Carolina
from to to reexamine the effect of prenatal care on the health of newborns We extend on the prior literature
by estimating the longer term effects of prenatal care on future health care utilization patterns identified from linked
South Carolina Medicaid claims files We estimate plausibly causal impacts of prenatal care by including maternal fixed
effects which control for all time invariant unobserved characteristics of the mother Understanding the causal effect of
prenatal care on child health and health care utilization is of paramount importance and the results we obtain are
likely to have important policy implications regarding the long term cost effectiveness of prenatal care
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Outline of theoretical model
The theoretical framework underlying our study mirrors the health production function in a dynamic setting outlined
by Liu et al In their framework it is assumed parents maximize a time separable concave utility function with
per period utility given by U ct ht where ct represents consumption during period t and ht represents child health at
the start of the period Health cannot be altered within a time period nor can it be directly purchased but parents can
impact the future health of their children through health inputs ft Again following the notation in Liu Mroz and
Adair we assume health status in the next period is given by
CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY

BERSAK AND SONCHAK ARDAN
with the deterministic health production function and st l a health shock distributed with mean of In this
framework the information set Qt captures parental information about the future distributions of prices income and
health shocks as of time t and the expected health stock in time period t is equal to Additionally assume
that the following all hold
and
Dht Dft
DhtDhf
Liu Mroz and Adair show that the solution to the dynamic optimization problem where parents maximize the
present discounted value of expected utility subject to a resource constraint given by yt ct p t with yt representing
parental resources pt representing the price of health inputs and the price of consumption normalized to implies the
demand for health inputs at time t is a function of the form
ft Dft yt ht pt ot
Equation shows that the demand for health inputs only depends on the state variables observed at time t They go
on to explain that under certain conditions including the assumption that the distributions of health shocks st are
independent over time it is not necessary to further condition the demand for inputs based on the information set
However some features of preventive care may compress or eliminate some outcomes from the distribution of
shocks in which case it is not appropriate to assume this distribution is independent over time Although some of these
impacts are captured by improved health on average preventive care may also change the variance of outcomes
Schoder and Zweifel posit that this feature may be an important determinant of health care demand in some
cases For example if st is distributed uniformly on the interval parents are willing to pay for preventive care that
changes the distribution of st to be distributed uniformly on the interval In this case the information set must
contain beliefs about how health inputs change the entire distribution of future health care shocks I and not just beliefs
about the marginal productivity of care
In our setting it is likely that most direct effects of prenatal care on health are primarily through reducing the
variance of outcomes by monitoring for severe complications Additionally a fraction of the estimated impacts of
prenatal care seem likely to arise from indirect effects whereby prenatal care influences the maternal information
making mothers more likely to cease smoking eat nutritious food or otherwise modify behaviors that directly influence
infant birth weight In one of the few studies that we are aware of which separately estimates the impacts of the content
of prenatal care Kogan et al find that women who do not receive all types of recommended advice during their
prenatal care visits are significantly more likely to have an infant born at low birthweight than those that receive the
advice and also find no association between any clinical aspects of prenatal care and low birthweight Additionally
Yan provides evidence that maternal weight gain and smoking during pregnancy behaviors that are influenced
by the provision of information during prenatal care appointments are two distinct mechanisms through which
prenatal care influences infant health while Yan also shows that these behaviors are influenced by prenatal care
On the other hand Dave et al do not find evidence that increased contact with providers following Medicaid
expansions leads to modifications in maternal behavior during pregnancy though they do find evidence that access to
insurance causes some behavioral changes through moral hazard Though not related to prenatal care Dave and
Kaestner find evidence that increased contact with physicians can lead to significant behavioral changes in
Medicare eligible individuals In our case the total estimated impacts of prenatal care on future health care utilization
will also be influenced if prenatal care changes parental beliefs about the value of future health care and we refer to this
possibility as the information effect of prenatal care
Implications of theoretical model for interpretations related to future health care
utilization
In an ideal world we would estimate the net effects of prenatal care on future health outcomes In our data however
we only observe future health care utilization meaning our estimated impacts of prenatal care combine changes in
BERSAK AND SONCHAK ARDAN

demand for future care arising from better health with changes in demand arising from changes to the maternal in
formation set Given that providing information and education is a large component of most prenatal care it is highly
plausible that prenatal care influences the information set by providing parents with information about postnatal health
behaviors including interacting with the health care delivery system
The estimated impacts of prenatal care on future health care utilization are given by estimating I with ft rep
resenting prenatal care Assuming prenatal care does not influence parental income or prices within the year imme
diately following birth our observed net effects of prenatal care on future health care utilization are driven by two
distinct pieces
Dft l
Dft
DDI DDft
Dht l Dft Dft
The first term on the right hand side of Equation is the change in demand caused by any impacts of
prenatal care on health status Our model assumes this term is weakly negative as all else equal those in better
health will consume less care Additionally the broad range of empirical findings outlined previously suggest this
term is in fact non positive The sign of the second term on the right hand side of Equation is theoretically
ambiguous as increased information is likely to increase the demand for some types of health care while reducing
it for others In cases where the net estimated impact of prenatal care on future care utilization is positive
however
must hold and the impact on care utilization arising from this change in information must be
large enough to outweigh reduced utilization from better health Note that this does not imply that individuals who
consume less care are necessarily in better health as the information effect can reduce the demand for certain
types of care Rather it implies that if prenatal care is associated with both better health and increased con
sumption of a given type of future care it must be the case that the information effect increased the demand for
that type of care
In the context of our theoretical model we expect the information effect associated with prenatal care to increase
the demand for preventive types of care such as WCVs and to have little impact on inpatient IP care which is
typically only accessed through a physician gatekeeper The predicted sign of the information effect for care in an
emergency department ED is theoretically ambiguous If preventive care is a substitute for ED usage increased in
formation should decrease the demand for care in an ED In a current NBER working paper Danagoulian et al
document that increased primary care visits following an information shock from the Flint water crisis led to a sig
nificant reduction in subsequent avoidable childhood ED visits If however preventive care and ED care are used as
complements in the production of health and the prevention of disease it is possible that the information effect would
increase the demand for emergency care Maeng et al document that primary care visits appear to be com
plementary to multiple ED visits while Chen et al find that increased usage of primary care following increases
in Medicaid reimbursement rates does not decrease ED usage suggesting that primary care and ED care may not be
substitutes on the margin In our setting if a portion of prenatal care appointments are used to communicate common
signs of infant distress that require timely care prenatal care may make mothers more likely to recognize when an
appropriate threshold for seeking care has been crossed This information would induce a mother to seek care in either
an outpatient urgent care or emergency setting for her child depending on what is available at the moment the
threshold is breached Our results suggest this is the case and that the information effect dominates the health effect for
both well child and ED care
DATA
Vital statistics data
Although United States federal law requires the collection and publication of Vital Statistics data Federal Vital Statistics
do not contain personal identifiers However some individual states will release personally identifiable information for
specific research purposes In this study we use Natality Data from the State of South Carolina for the time period of
The data are collected from birth certificates and include nearly all births occurring in South Carolina

during the time period under investigation Researchers from the Division of Biostatistics of the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control linked mothers across time and provided de identified data for this
project These data include detailed information on infant health at birth including birth weight gestational age the
presence of birth abnormalities and whether the child was admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit NICU They
also contain basic demographic information pertaining to mother and child maternal education age race child s
gender detailed measures of maternal pre pregnancy and pregnancy risk factors and information on prenatal care
utilization We use these data to construct our main measures of infant health and provide summary statistics in
Table
The Natality data provide information on the number of prenatal care visits the month of pregnancy during which
prenatal care was initiated and the adequacy of prenatal care All of these measures have variously been employed in
different studies throughout the literature We focus on first trimester initiation of prenatal care which is indicative of
prenatal care timing and an early commencement of prenatal care is urged by doctors Additionally as pointed out by
Currie and Rossin Slater the number of prenatal care visits may not be an appropriate measure as the number of
visits are at least partially determined by the length of gestation which is an important determinant of birth weight
itself While our primary specifications compare first trimester initiation of care to an aggregated measure of any other
initiation our first trimester results are robust to separately controlling for second and third trimester initiation relative
to no prenatal care
Because early initiation of prenatal care may not fully capture the amount of prenatal care received by mothers we
employ an alternative measure as a robustness check the adequacy of prenatal care as measured by the Kotelchuck
index This index is constructed by calculating a ratio of observed to expected prenatal care visits adjusted for gesta
tional age classified into four categories inadequate intermediate adequate and adequate plus Kotelchuck We
compress this categorical variable into a binary indicator for whether a mother received at least adequate prenatal care
Finally in online Appendix E we re estimate our models with indicators for first trimester initiation third trimester
initiation and no prenatal care to allow for a finer gradation of the impacts of prenatal care than those of our binary
measures as presented in the main text
For outcomes we employ a continuous measure of birth weight as well as the incidence of low birth weight
g and very low birth weight g Medical and economic research has generally found convincing
evidence of the detrimental effects of low birth weight on infant survival and future health An additional indicator
for infant health is gestational age at birth Infants that are born prematurely less than weeks of gestation have a
much higher incidence of mortality According to Mathews et al health issues related to prematurity were
responsible for of all infant deaths in Additionally premature infants may suffer long term neurological
impairments developmental delays and physical disabilities leading to significant health care costs throughout life
Although gestational age can directly influence the number of visits it cannot influence the onset of prenatal care
Therefore we also estimate the effect of prenatal care on the likelihood of being born prematurely as well as on the
likelihood of being small for gestational age SGA and being admitted into a NICU Finally we estimate the impacts
of prenatal care on the incidence of high birth weight g maternal smoking during pregnancy and maternal
weight gain as these outcomes are likely to reflect the pure informational impacts of prenatal care as measured at
birth
Medicaid claims data
The South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs office provided data from South Carolina Medicaid claims of children
between and These claims are submitted to the state for reimbursement and provide a rich source of in
formation on health care utilization for Medicaid enrollees Specifically each claim provides information on medical
procedures that took place during health care encounters medical diagnoses indicators for whether the claim origi
nated in an ED or IP setting and includes a unique patient identifier Additionally each claim has an associated
encounter identifier which allows us to identify whether multiple claims are associated with the same event while we
use this encounter ID to generate all count variables we continue to refer to the encounters as claims for ease of
exposition We use procedure codes and to identify WCVs and ICD diagnoses to identify
children who have ever received care for several ambulatory care sensitive early childhood conditions ACSCs which
are referenced in online Appendix A We provide sample means for all outcomes of interest in results Tables and

We construct all health and health care utilization measures by aggregating observed claims for each child within
the first year of life We choose to focus on the first year of life because we only observe claims for children that are
covered by Medicaid The vast majority over of Medicaid paid births in our sample are observed to have

singleton multiparous births between and that are observed to have any Medicaid eligibility before
From this we exclude observations with no observed claims during the first year of life births to mothers
aged younger than or older than and observations because of missing data Because this process leaves
some observations without sibling pairs we eliminate a further observations leaving us with a final unit of
analysis of multiparous children Of these births are from distinct mothers that change their
prenatal care utilization across pregnancies While our estimated impacts of prenatal care are only identified by those
mothers who change their utilization of prenatal care across pregnancies we provide summary statistics for all
observed births with Medicaid eligibility and no missing data for comparison We choose to exclude children
with observed claims because any child moving out of state or obtaining access to an alternate source of care or
insurance would not show up in our claims data Given that this group represents only about of our sample we
believe it is likely that the majority of these infants are obtaining care outside of the South Carolina Medicaid system
rather than truly forgoing all care including well child care Finally it should be noted that the children included
in our analysis represent approximately of the total births observed in South Carolina between and

We assume outcomes for child i born to mother j at time period t in county c and in month m can be represented by
yt Ac V m Cijtcm
ijtcm
Yijtcm is a child outcome such as birth weight in grams or number of WCVs PCijtcm represents a measure of prenatal
care Xijtcm is a vector of observed maternal and child characteristics including mother s age race education reported
household income pre pregnancy BMI length of gestation in weeks indicator variables for whether a mother was
smoking before pregnancy pre pregancy diabetes and hypertension previous poor birth outcomes or preterm birth
previous c section child gender first born status indicators for ages of older siblings at the time of birth and prenatal
WIC participation We also include separate indicators yt Ac and l m for year month and county of birth respectively
Finally gj represents unobserved time invariant characteristics of the mother such as health attitudes or endowments
while Eijtcm represents unobserved time variant factors that influence health outcomes
As previously discussed one difficulty associated with obtaining causal estimates of prenatal care s impacts on
future outcomes is that unobserved maternal characteristics may simultaneously influence these outcomes and how a
pregnant mother utilizes prenatal care If this is the case unobserved maternal characteristics gj will be correlated
with the measure of prenatal care PC For instance health conscious mothers may initiate early and frequent
ijtcm
doctors visits and be more likely to give birth to healthy babies independently of prenatal care This will result in
positive selection and OLS estimates of Equation will overstate the benefits of prenatal care On the other hand
unhealthy mothers may compensate for their own poor health by utilizing more prenatal care In this case the OLS
estimated impact of prenatal care on birth outcomes will be biased downward
To circumvent bias stemming from the inability to control explicitly for maternal health endowments or attitudes
we employ mother specific fixed effects The availability of panel data allows us to compare birth outcomes to the same
mother and control explicitly for gj meaning the key identifying assumption is that the decision to utilize prenatal care
is only uncorrelated with time variant unobserved maternal characteristics Cijtcm We will obtain consistent estimates as
long as there are not unobserved time variant factors that influence both outcomes and prenatal care utilization and by
explicitly controlling for gj our estimated impacts of prenatal care are obtained from differences in outcomes for
mothers who change their prenatal care behavior across pregnancies
We attempt to mitigate any concerns about our identification strategy in a number of ways To control for the
possibility of feedback across pregnancies our preferred specifications include a rich set of controls related to outcomes
of prior pregnancies and add a full set of year month and county of birth fixed effects to control for geographic or
temporal factors that may influence access to care We mitigate concerns that changes in family income insurance
status or access to care could potentially drive changes in prenatal care utilization and future outcomes by limiting our
analyses to only those infants who are eligible for Medicaid within their first year of life and all reported results are
robust to controlling for the observed payer at delivery and further control for reported family income to address
concerns that changes to the Medicaid income eligibility threshold for infants during our study period are driving our
results Finally we present all fixed effects estimates with both the complete exclusion of controls and with a limited
subset of demographic controls to illustrate the stability of the estimates and the degree to which prenatal care is
correlated with observed time variant factors Our estimates are quite stable to the inclusion of these controls sug
gesting that prenatal care is not highly correlated with observed factors that also influence outcomes and diminishing
the concern that it is likely correlated with unobserved factors
We test for reverse causality using observed pre pregnancy maternal health factors as outcomes as correlations
may indicate other unobserved components of maternal health that are related to both the decision to seek pre
natal care and to future health outcomes Even with these robustness checks our identification strategy may still
be biased if there are unobserved factors that are specific to a given pregnancy such as low maternal weight gain
or vaginal bleeding during the first trimester that influence the decision to seek care and outcomes for that
pregnancy Although we cannot directly rule this possibility out factors such as these seem most likely to reveal
the potential for poor health status and would therefore bias our results downwards causing us to underestimate
any benefits of prenatal care Concerns that the decision to seek prenatal care is directly related to variations in
household income or insurance status are mitigated by the fact that all of our estimated impacts on future uti
lization are obtained within the sample of Medicaid eligible children While there may be some concern due to the
CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
BERSAK AND SONCHAK ARDAN
fact that our data span both the Great Recession and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act these events
would only pose identification problems if they changed the composition of Medicaid eligible births or directly
influence prenatal care utilization and future outcomes However South Carolina was one of the states which did
not expand Medicaid following the passage of the Affordable Care Act and we only observe slight no more than
from baseline increases in the number of Medicaid eligible births during the Great Recession Additionally we
observe between and of mothers with first trimester initiation of prenatal care for each of the years in
our data suggesting that if any changes in utilization patterns are driven by the Great Recession they are small in
nature
A final concern is that the subgroup of mothers who change their prenatal care utilization across pregnancies are
fundamentally different from mothers with consistent prenatal care In Table we present summary statistics for three
distinct groups of mothers all mothers in column multiparous mothers in column and mothers with differences in
first trimester initiation of care across different births in column Although the subgroup of mothers in column look
somewhat similar to the full sample of multiparous mothers along many dimensions most differences between the
groups are statistically significant due to the large sample sizes It is important to remember that inclusion in this group
is conditional upon having at least one pregnancy in both groups of prenatal care and it is therefore logical and to be
expected that the averages for the prenatal care variables as well as all potential outcome variables would be signifi
cantly different from the full sample averages
Equation assumes the impacts of prenatal care are constant and symmetric across the birth order and irre
spective of the direction of change meaning we will not identify any impacts of prenatal care that arise through
mechanisms which durably impact future outcomes For instance if an educational component of prenatal care
provides durable human capital then any mothers with adequate prenatal care in an early pregnancy would continue
to see impacts in future pregnancies regardless of future prenatal care utilization Broadly speaking we find no
consistent differential impacts of prenatal care for first born children when we relax these assumptions and we report
results from this set of estimates and provide a brief discussion of the theoretical implications in online Appendix C
Our approach also implicitly assumes that prenatal care from an early pregnancy does not influence observed
maternal pre pregnancy risk factors such as smoking status or BMI before becoming pregnant To the extent that
these assumptions are invalid they will bias us against finding any impacts of prenatal care and our estimates that
control for observed pre pregnancy risk factors can be interpreted as the impacts of prenatal care net of any impacts
arising through these channels
In spite of these robustness checks our results still rest on the key assumption of this identification strategy that
changes in prenatal care utilization across pregnancies are not related to unobserved changes in maternal charac
teristics There are a number of exogenous factors that could cause changes to prenatal care utilization stemming from
the supply side of the health care delivery system Low income Medicaid women may have difficulties finding a
physician willing to accept them scheduling health care appointments or having to wait for long periods in clinics
Beckmann et al Sunil et al Some studies identified changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates to
physicians for treating Medicaid patients as a determinant of the amount of prenatal care received by women
Gray Sonchak Other studies have exploited factors that influence access to care such as a lack of
transportation transportation disruptions or distance to clinics Evans and Lien estimate that a transportation
strike in Pennsylvania contributed to missed prenatal care visits while in related work Rossin Slater finds
geographic access to a clinic impacts a mother s likelihood of participation in the Women Infants and Children WIC
program
Unfortunately because our data only come from South Carolina and do not include particularly fine measures of
patient or provider location we are not able to empirically identify specific external factors that cause changes in
prenatal care over time in our setting However as mentioned above we control for a rich set of time variant personal
maternal characteristics as well as provide a battery of robustness checks that adds credence to our findings Addi
tionally this identification strategy has been recently used by Yan to estimate the impacts of prenatal care on
outcomes at birth and by Bersak and Sonchak and Chorniy et al to provide plausibly causal estimates of
the impact of receiving WIC on childhood health and health care outcomes To the extent that the reasons behind
changes in prenatal care are exogenous to changes in factors we are unable to control for these results will provide
causal estimates on the effect of prenatal care on infant health and health care utilization Additionally it should be
noted our that findings that primary care visits and ED visits are used in a complementary fashion in the production of
infant health do not rely on the validity of this identification strategy

RESULTS
Validity of fixed effects strategy
Table contains our estimated impacts of prenatal care on pre pregnancy smoking body mass index BMI hyper
tension diabetes and for second or later births prior poor pregnancy outcomes Because each of these outcomes
occur prior to pregnancy they cannot be influenced by prenatal care and therefore observed correlations are indicative
of self selection into prenatal care The OLS estimates contained in column suggest there is on net some negative
selection into prenatal care as early initiation of care is associated with a higher probability of pre pregnancy smoking
obesity hypertension and prior poor pregnancy outcomes Within mothers however we find more limited evidence of
selection into prenatal care across pregnancies with the exception of prior poor birth outcomes In column we report
fixed effects estimates that exclude all other controls and estimate that only pre pregnancy hypertension and prior poor
birth outcomes are associated with early initiation of prenatal care In column with the inclusion of demographic
controls we see a small and marginally significant relationship between prenatal care initiation and pre pregnancy
tobacco usage and a positive and statistically significant relationship between prenatal care and prior poor out
comes Finally in column we estimate that receiving adequate prenatal care is associated with a statistically sig
nificant percentage point decrease in the probability of maternal smoking prior to pregnancy While this result is
statistically different from it represents a decrease of less than from the baseline probability of smoking before
pregnancy and is therefore a relatively small change Taken on the whole the estimates in Table suggest that after the
inclusion of maternal fixed effects prenatal care is at worst weakly related to observed maternal risk factors while the

OLS results are indicative of negative selection bias with some mothers compensating for other risky behaviors by
initiating prenatal care earlier There is some stronger evidence that some prenatal care may be related to prior
pregnancy outcomes where some mothers may self sort into early initiation of prenatal care which is more concerning
for our identification strategy However the low baseline frequency of prior poor outcomes means that a relatively small
number of mothers are in this group and are therefore unlikely to drive our other results As a robustness check to
ensure that selection following prior poor outcomes does not drive our results in online Appendix D we exclude all
births occurring to mothers with prior poor outcomes and obtain qualitatively similar results
Impacts of prenatal care on outcomes at birth
Table shows the impacts of prenatal care on outcomes measured at birth We present OLS results in column for
comparison fixed effects estimates with the complete exclusion of controls in column and fixed effects estimates with
the inclusion of only demographic controls in column The point estimated impacts of prenatal care are remarkably
stable across all fixed effects specifications although they are somewhat more precise with the inclusion of controls
Using our preferred specifications in column which contain fixed effects and all controls first trimester initiation of
prenatal care is associated with an increased birth weight of g as well as a decrease in the probability of being born
below the low birth weight and very low birth weight thresholds of and g by and percentage points
respectively Because these are relatively rare outcomes this represents a decrease in the incidence of infants
born at low birth weight and a decrease in the incidence of infants born at very low birth weight
First trimester initiation of prenatal care is also associated with between a and percentage point reduction
in the probability of being SGA or being admitted to the NICU at birth which represent between a and
reduction in the baseline incidence Although all point estimates obtained from fixed effects specifications are smaller
than those obtained via OLS they are all statistically significant at a confidence level While we estimate that early
initiation of prenatal care is associated with a reduction in the probability of preterm birth in columns and when we
include controls the relationship is small and statistically insignificant In column we report estimates using the
Kotelchuck index as an alternative measure for prenatal care for the most part these results are similar to those ob
tained when using first trimester initiation with the notable exception that adequate prenatal care is associated with a
statistically significant increase in the probability of pre term births However this difference is not particularly sur
prising given that the number of observed visits relative to gestational age is a component of the index itself meaning
that a mother with a set number of visits will be classified as having received adequate care if her infant is born at a
younger gestational age
The final three outcomes in Table indicate the extent to which prenatal care changes maternal behaviors during
pregnancy and influences outcomes through informational rather than purely clinical mechanisms Across all fixed
effects specifications we estimate that first trimester initiation of care is associated with a statistically significant in
crease in the probability of an infant being born at high birth weight and of maternal weight gain during pregnancy
Excessively high birth weight is viewed as an adverse outcome meaning that the association between prenatal care and
high birth weight is almost definitely reflecting maternal behavioral changes during pregnancy rather than clinical
interventions We also generally estimate that prenatal care is associated with a decrease in the probability of maternal
smoking during pregnancy though this result is not statistically significant when controls other than maternal fixed
effects are excluded in column and the point estimated impact in our preferred specifications in column of
percentage points represents only a decrease from baseline
Impacts of prenatal care on early childhood health care utilization
Table presents estimated impacts of prenatal care on early childhood health care utilization for three distinct types of
care care received in an IP setting an ED setting and WCVs We estimate prenatal care is associated with a statistically
significant increase in both WCVs and ED utilization along with a small but statistically significant decrease in the
number of IP stays and all sets of results are qualitatively robust to the exclusion or inclusion of additional controls
though the estimates are somewhat attenuated after controlling for demographics and year county and month fixed
effects Additionally they are quite stable to the inclusion of maternal risk factors suggesting that feedback across
pregnancies is not a large concern The estimated impact of first trimester initiation of care on both ED and WC Vs is

On the whole the results presented in Table provide strong support for the theoretical prediction that prenatal
care influences maternal information outlined in Equation and provide evidence that the information effect in
creases the demand for certain types of future health care Our estimated impacts of health measured at birth as well as
the dissipation of any significant impacts on IP care after we control for birth weight suggest prenatal care likely
improves child health Given that IP care is usually not directly demanded by patients and is instead accessed through
either a primary care gatekeeper or referral from an ED finding that prenatal care does not influence IP care through an
information effect seems plausible However if prenatal care is associated with better health status as suggested by our
birth outcome and IP results these results imply that the information effect of prenatal care must increase the demand
for both well visits and ED care and that these impacts are larger than any reduction in demand caused by better health
Our estimates around WCVs can be interpreted in a similar way although it seems plausible that the health effect
would be negligible for well child care
Differential impacts of prenatal care by race

black mothers separately We report estimates corresponding to column in Tables and in columns and while
our results in columns and include controls for birthweight and correspond to column in Table We generally
estimate that prenatal care has a larger direct impact on health for infants of white mothers with our percentage point
estimated impacts being larger for infant birthweight and the probability of being LBW or SGA Because infants born to
black mothers tend to have worse outcomes on average the point estimated impacts of prenatal care on the probability

of VLBW and NICU admission are smaller in relative terms for black mothers even though they are larger in absolute
terms These results are similar to those found by Currie and Grogger and Sonchak who both estimated
that prenatal care visits had positive benefits on birthweight for white mothers but not for black mothers
This relationship however flips when we look at outcomes that are more likely to be influenced through the in
formation mechanism We estimate that prenatal care is associated with larger relative changes in the probability of
smoking during pregnancy having a high birth weight infant and maternal weight gain for black mothers Addi
tionally we estimate that early initiation of prenatal care only increases utilization of emergency care for infants of
black mothers and that it increases WCVs by nearly more for black mothers than it does for white mothers We
also estimate that prenatal care is only associated with decreased utilization of IP care for white mothers though this
effect is only marginally significant and dissipates after controlling for birth weight suggesting that these impacts may
largely be due to the improvements in infant health that are observed for children of white mothers
On the whole the results in Table provide interesting insights that deserve further investigation in future work
While they suggest that the direct health effects of prenatal care exist for both black and white mothers they do appear
to be larger for white mothers However the informational mechanism particularly as relates to future health care
utilization appears to be much larger for black mothers These results are quite consistent with the proposals suggested
by Gadson et al to reduce racial disparities in maternal outcomes during pregnancy and outline the many ways
in which non hispanic black mothers experience worse outcomes than other racial groups Many of these innovations
such as the CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care model which was rolled out in South Carolina during our study
period do not substantively change the clinical aspects of prenatal care but do offer a wider range of opportunity for
provider interactions and the provision of information and our results here support the hypothesis that these mech
anisms may be particularly important for black mothers
CONCLUSION
We estimate that prenatal care is associated with improved infant health as measured by observable outcomes at birth
Across the board our results for birth outcomes are consistent with the range of positive estimates reported in the
literature detailed by Corman et al If IP health care utilization is a reasonable proxy for latent health status our
results do suggest that prenatal care broadly improves child health during the first year of life though our results also
suggest that at least some of this impact is driven by better health at birth Finally our results on the utilization of well
child care are entirely consistent with Reichman et al lending them additional credibility
Our results also suggest prenatal care is associated with increases in the future utilization of health care in most
settings including ED care According to figures presented in Lu and Kuo the national average cost
associated with a pediatric IP stay for an ACSC in was with a median cost of According to
figures presented in McWilliams et al the average cost associated with a pediatric ED visit in in
Charlotte NC for a condition related to an ACSC was in dollars Under the assumption that our
estimated changes in utilization are associated with conditions that cost an average amount to treat in each of
these settings using the point estimates in Table suggests that first trimester initiation of care is associated with a
net reduction of in spending per child in emergency and IP settings within the first year of life and that
adequate prenatal care was associated with a net reduction of in spending per child in emergency and IP
settings within the first year of life While these cost savings are modest and are likely offset to some additional
extent by an increase in costs associated with additional utilization of primary care they do suggest that the cost
savings from reducing future hospitalizations are at least large enough to balance out any increased costs from
additional ED care caused by increasing access to prenatal care
As with all studies there are some important caveats and limitations to note regarding the external validity of
our findings First it is important to reiterate that only mothers with multiple Medicaid eligible births are included
in our sample meaning that our results may not generalize to mothers with only one child or those who are not
eligible for Medicaid During the time period we look at however Medicaid does pay for a majority of births in
South Carolina so the results are of interest even if they do not generalize beyond this group Our sample also
only contains births occurring in South Carolina and the results may not necessarily generalize to other states
When comparing births in our data set from with National Birth Certificates data for it is clear that the
Medicaid eligible mothers in South Carolina are more disadvantaged than the average mother with a Medicaid paid
birth In fact mothers in our sample are younger less educated and are more likely to have poor birth outcomes

and various pregnancy risk factors than their whole country peer group Finally there may be concerns that
tertiary factors such as low Medicaid reimbursement rates are acting as barriers to care and driving our results
While it certainly seems plausible that access to care may be a determinant of both prenatal care and WCVs
adequate access to care is not typically associated with increasing ED usage and so seems unlikely to drive our
results If a different unobserved factor such as infant wantedness were driving our primary results it would still
not jeopardize our conclusion that mothers of infants tend to utilize well child care and emergency care in a
complementary fashion
Although it is beyond the scope of what we are able to accomplish with this study one particularly fruitful area
for future research will be to look at the path dependency of health care utilization The totality of our results
appear most consistent with the explanation that prenatal care increases health care utilization perhaps through
educating mothers about potential warning signs that could require urgent attention and therefore helps mitigate
the severity of some early childhood ailments The model and results we present here suggest the demand for
health care at a point in time is a function of prior health care consumed and more work is needed in this area to
be able to make fully informed judgments as to the complete long run impacts and cost effectiveness of prenatal
care as well as whether prenatal care is the most efficient means through which to provide maternal information
Our results agree with the conclusion reached by Yan that expanding access to prenatal care would help
improve infant health at birth relative to the status quo However our hypothesized mechanisms also suggest that
expanding other community based programs providing educational resources and support to mothers could
represent exciting opportunities for additional low cost interventions that may prove equally successful at
improving infant health through informational mechanisms

In other words beliefs about the entire distribution of shocks in both the presence and absence of care
Procedure codes and are technically used for children age to age but we observe a small number of likely coding errors in
our sample from claims using these codes
The reported point estimated impacts of prenatal care which follow are virtually identical to those obtained if we restrict the sample to
only those mothers who change prenatal care utilization across pregnancies
Except for the outcomes of preterm birth and probability of being small for gestational age
We do not aggregate previous poor birth outcomes Rather the data element provided by the state of South Carolina is coded as Previous
poor birth outcomes It is our understanding that this measure along with our other prior birth outcomes are reported as true if a
mother experienced a poor birth outcome in any previous birth
For all reported estimates errors are clustered at the level of the mother to allow for the influence of unobservables to be correlated across
births for each mother However all statistical inference is robust to clustering the errors at the county level to allow for unobservables to
be correlated geographically
If for example changes in prenatal care across pregnancies are caused by unobserved changes in access to the health care system it
would then mean that mothers with greater access to the health care system utilize both more primary and emergency department care
Although not reported here we also estimate that early initiation of prenatal care is associated with increases of roughly additional
sick visits those which do not originate in an ED nor are inpatient or the conditions included in within the first year of life suggesting
that it is not solely access to care which is driving any observed increased utilization of emergency care
Though not reported here the results presented in this and all subsequent subsections are also robust to the inclusion of controls for
insurance payer at birth
Though not reported we find small less than impacts of prenatal care on the extensive margin of any inpatient claims any care in an
ED or any WCVs and these impacts are only statistically significant for ED visits or WCVs
Less than of our final sample do not identify as white or black in our data and so are excluded from this analysis

ABSTRACT
Background Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic unit diseases that have different prevalence
in different parts of the world Antiepileptic drugs AEDs are associated with major fertility risks for
women of childbearing age Due to the fact that studies on family planning methods in married women
with epilepsy WWE have not been conducted in Iran the aim of this study was to evaluate the family
planning methods in married WWE in Birjand Iran
Methods An analytical descriptive study was performed on married WWE hospitalized in the neu
rology ward or referred to Vali e Asr specialized and sub specialized clinic in Birjand Demographic infor
mation of patients as well as data on the type of used AED and various methods of family planning were
collected in a questionnaire Data analysis was performed using Chi square and Fisher tests All of the
above analyses were considered at a significance level of less than by SPSS v software
Results The mean age of the patients was years The mean age of experiencing the first sei
zure and the onset of menstruation were and years respectively Fifty
and patients used sodium valproate carbamazepine phenytoin levetirac
etam and lamotrigine respectively The results showed that sexually active patients used
family planning methods of which patients used withdrawal method patients used
condoms and patients used oral contraceptive pills OCP Eight patients had a history of
unintended pregnancy and patients had a history of abortion
Conclusion It is recommended to apply effective family planning methods in married WWE to prevent
unintended pregnancies and the subsequent adverse effects in the fetus considering the fact that a sig
nificant percentage of WWE did not use effective family planning methods and cases of unintended
pregnancies were reported Because of high consumption of valproate in women of childbearing age in
our study and concerning issue about its fetal malformation it is recommended to reduce the adminis
tration of valproate in this population Moreover regarding the low consumption of folic acid especially
for women of childbearing age and pregnant WWE who are taking AED the necessary recommendations
should be made by our physicians
Seizures and epilepsy are one of the most common diseases of
the nervous system Epilepsy has different prevalence in differ
ent parts of the world so that in the United States its prevalence is
per people There are no exact statistics in Iran but in a
study conducted in the prevalence of epilepsy was reported

Sayeh Miri the prevalence of epilepsy in Iran was estimated at
around in
Epilepsy severely affects a patient s quality
of life due to a variety of problems it causes On the other hand
improper control of epilepsy in patients leaves irreparable financial
and cerebral complications
Antiepileptic drugs AEDs are
associated with two major fertility risks for women of childbearing
age with epilepsy first the increased risk of unplanned pregnan
cies due to AEDs with induction of liver enzyme properties that
reduce sex hormone levels after taking oral contraceptive pills
F Ershadi Seyed Mohammad Mousavi Mirzaei N Tabrizi et al
OCP second the increased risk of birth defects Enzyme inducing
AEDs associated with OCP failure include carbamazepine pheny
toin phenobarbital and primidone These drugs reduce the estra
diol levels in OCPs by approximately and may also reduce
free progestin levels by increasing sex hormone binding globulins
SHBG AEDs have teratogenic effects in infants including mis
carriage neural tube defects premature birth and hypoxia They
also may cause labor like pains postpartum hemorrhage and
increased cesarean rates in mothers The mechanism of these
teratogenic effects is unknown in many cases but in the case of
sodium valproate it is stated that this drug interferes with ion
channels and thus causes side effects in various organs especially
in the brain
The AED valproate has a risk of developing
neural tube defects
Furthermore mental development is
reduced by in children exposed to valproate
The IQ
score of children exposed to valproate was the lowest averaging
about with and scores lower than carbamazepine and lam
otrigine respectively
Some chronic teratogenic effects that
have been reported by these drugs include congenital heart dis
ease urogenital defects hip dislocation hydronephrosis syn
dactyly and palate and cleft lip defects
Some of these
drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy
The awareness
of women with epilepsy WWE about the interaction of AEDs with
oral contraceptives and the potential for teratogenicity was evalu
ated and little knowledge was observed in these patients
Other studies have also shown the importance of accurate and reg
ular education of family planning methods in patients with epi
lepsy to prevent the teratogenic effects of AEDs
Due to the
fact that studies on family planning methods in married WWE
have not been conducted in Iran yet the aim of this study was to
evaluate the family planning methods in married WWE in Birjand
Iran

To the best of our knowledge this study was the first study that
has been conducted to evaluate family planning methods in mar
ried WWE in Iran Among patients with sexual activity
of the patients were using the family planning methods with
withdrawal method being the most commonly used method
The remaining patients did not use any family
planning methods despite receiving teratogenic drugs The results
of our study showed that IUD injection of depo medroxy proges
terone acetate and tubectomy were the least used methods
The pattern of family planning methods used among WWE in
developed and developing countries is different In developing
countries the family planning methods in WWE was reported only
in Senegal and Kenya
In a Senegalese cohort
only out of WWE used contraception with nearly
one third of them consuming oral contraceptive drugs
Furthermore WWE concomitantly used hormonal family plan
ning methods with AED including enzyme inducers and two of
them became pregnant despite proper contraception
In a cross sectional study in Kenya patients did not
use any type of family planning method during consumption of
AEDs Only WWE of reproductive age years were
using contraception Of these and used
injectable intra uterine contraceptive device condoms and bilat
eral tubal ligation BTL respectively
In developed countries
several studies evaluated prescribing patterns of contraceptive in
WWE of childbearing age For example in the study by Bhakta
et al out of WWE had a family planning method
Epilepsy Behavior
when taking a potentially teratogenic AED Of these the majority
of patients used an oral combined hormonal contra
ceptive or progestin only pill Five WWE were on depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate and were on an IUD either
levonorgestrel or copper
Another retrospective survey on
WWE showed that of patients used oral combined OCP for
It seems that the most common family plan
contraception
ning method in developed or developing countries is oral contra
ceptives while most of WWE do not use proper contraception It
should be noted that among the various methods of contraception
in WWE IUD appears to be an appropriate candidate This is
because the use of levonorgestrel containing IUDs prevents unin
tended pregnancies while does not alter epilepsy control and the
level of AEDs
Bosak s study suggested IUDs as an ideal contra
ception for WWE
The first and second line AEDs recom
mended by the World Health Organization WHO in sub
Saharan Africa SSA are as follows phenobarbital carbamazepine
phenytoin and valproic acid as the first line and lamotrigine and
levetiracetam as the second line of treatment First line drugs are
associated with adverse outcomes for the fetus
In the present
study the evaluation of prescribed AEDs showed that of the
patients were consuming sodium valproate carbamazepine
phenytoin levetiracetam and In devel
oped countries one study was conducted to describe the pattern of
AED use in pregnant women and women of childbearing age dur
ing a decade in the Lombardy region of Italy During
women of childbearing age prevalence were
prescribed at least one AED Pregabalin was the most common AED
in women of childbearing age followed by valproic acid
In the prevalence of valproic acid in women of child
bearing age was In this amount was Since
levetiracetam and lamotrigine have been the most commonly pre
scribed drugs for pregnant women
Another study retrospec
tively analyzed the use of valproate in pregnancy and in women
of childbearing age between and in Switzerland The
most commonly used AED during pregnancy was lamotrigine fol
lowed by levetiracetam and pregabalin Among women aged
years the most commonly used AED was pregabalin followed
by lamotrigine topiramate and valproate Valproate use decreased
from per women in to per women
Also frequency of AEDs during pregnancy in participants in
our study indicated that of pregnant mothers in this
study did not take any AEDs during pregnancy patients
took levetiracetam and patients took carba
mazepine In a study by Khomand et al it was found that the most
commonly used drug by pregnant WWE was carbamazepine
In both Nigeria
and Kenya
carbamazepine was the most
commonly used AED by pregnant WWE whereas in Senegal
phenobarbital was administered in up to of pregnant
WWE Although carbamazepine seems not be associated with a
significant increase in the risk of congenital malformations
a higher prevalence of congenital malformations of has been
reported in recent studies
Conversely in developed countries
the use of carbamazepine and valproate is declining For example
in a study by Man et al it was found that lamotrigine was increas
ingly consumed during pregnancy compared to carbamazepine
and valproate
A retrospective study in WWE found that
women received lamotrigine women took levetiracetam
women took carbamazepine took topiramate took oxcar
bazepine took phenytoin and used valproate
Although the use of valproate is decreasing in women of child
bearing age and pregnant women in developed countries yet val
proate is still one of the most commonly prescribed AEDs in
developing countries Valproate is the best therapeutic option for
idiopathic genetic generalized epilepsies however it is associ
ated with a high prevalence of fetal malformation and learning dis

Aim To suggest cut off points for body mass index BMI using gestational hypertension preeclampsia and gestational diabetes
mellitus GDM as cardiometabolic conditions in pregnancy Methods In this prospective study singleton pregnant women from
the fetal medicine service of the Brazilian Unified Health System were included The pregnancy perinatal and newborn data were
obtained from the clinical medical records Maternal anthropometry included an assessment of weight and height and the
prepregnancy BMI evaluation categorized according to the World Health Organization cut off points The area under the
curve and confidence interval values from receiver operator curves were generated to identify the optimal cut off points using
prepregnancy BMI with better sensitivity and specificity Results Data on pregnancies were analyzed with n
being classified as overweight obese n with GDM n with preeclampsia and n with
gestational hypertension The BMI cut off points for predicting cardiometabolic conditions were kg m S
E for women with GDM S E S E S E for women
with preeclampsia gestational hypertension and gestational hypertension plus preeclampsia respectively and kg m
S E for women with preeclampsia plus GDM Conclusion The findings suggest that the optimal prepregnancy
BMI cut off point is around m for pregnant women With maternal cardiometabolic conditions

Discussion
Our main finding was that the best prepregnancy BMI
threshold associated with cardiometabolic conditions during
pregnancy was around kg m Sensitivity considered the
most significant parameter in diagnostic evaluation
achieved an approximate rate of for gestational hyper
tension and for preeclampsia outcomes Furthermore
the ROC curve performance achieved a high AUC for gesta
tional hypertension using a prepregnancy BMI threshold of
kg
Regarding the GDM outcome BMI threshold of
kg m reached the lowest score among the outcomes
studied with a sensitivity of However the use of
the traditional adult BMI threshold of kg showed
worse performance reaching only sensitivity in the
sample Using the same traditional BMI of kg m as a
predictor of poor pregnancy outcome an average sensitiv
ity of was found in relation to preeclampsia and ges
tational hypertension
Pooled analysis of cardiometabolic outcomes shows that
the new suggested BMI threshold of has better
performance in predicting preeclampsia plus gestational
hypertension and the association of preeclampsia plus
GDM An average sensitivity of was achieved in both
outcomes The worst predictive performance of adult BMI
of m was achieved in the combined outcome of pre
eclampsia plus GDM with a sensitivity of only
Journal of Pregnancy
Regarding weight gain during pregnancy our sample
showed average adequacy of which is higher than the
international literature Research on weight gain during
pregnancy in Europe and North America reveals that ideal
weight gain is achieved in only to of pregnant
women The majority of cases tend to exceed the limit
resulting in overweight or obesity during labor and delivery
according to the adult BMI This is partly due to limited
access to nutritional counseling or obtaining foods with a
lower glycemic index during pregnancy
Selection of an appropriate BMI cut off point for Brazilian
women has been examined mainly due to the increasing prev
alence of noncommunicable diseases including obesity
A recent study carried out in Brazil focusing on women with
GDM highlights a substantial increase in maternal obesity
between the and to This highlights
the critical importance of prepregnancy monitoring for
women wishing to become pregnant
Previous studies have focused on various cutoffs for preg
nant women in different populations as part of efforts to
reduce chronic conditions An illustrative case is a case
control study carried out in Iran involving singleton preg
nancies conceived through assisted reproductive technology
This study identified a prepregnancy BMI of as
the threshold for an increased risk of GDM The authors
found a sensitivity of and a specificity of
Another retrospective cohort study that reviewed
medical records suggested that a lower prepreg
nancy BMI cutoff of kg to define obesity might be
appropriate for pregnant women in southern China The
authors suggest that this approach would better predict
adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes Unlike the anal
ysis in this article the authors found that the prevalence of
obesity was BMI kg due to the relatively
lean population
A recent study of pregnant women in China
focused on pregnancy outcomes and found a linear relation
ship between poor outcome and increased prepregnancy
adult BMI The authors evaluated gestational hypertension
with or without preeclampsia GDM cesarean section post
partum hemorrhage small for gestational age newborns
and macrosomia It was suggested that the ideal prepreg
nancy BMI range was between and with
the cut off point for overweight being kg and the
cut off point for obesity being
Adult BMI score compatible with obesity is considered a
strong predictor of general mortality among prospective epi
demiological studies In the context of pregnancy
the application of adult BMI thresholds is constrained
emphasizing that adult scores may result in low predictive
sensitivity for typical adverse pregnancy outcomes
In our study most women were classified as overweight
obese prior to pregnancy according to WHO criteria These
findings align with the global increase in overweight and
obesity which has reached epidemic levels in several coun
tries In Brazil a recent female cohort with par
ticipants found that the prevalence of overweight and
obesity more than doubled over the year span from
to
A systematic review and meta analysis of studies
revealed that prepregnancy overweight obesity status increases
the risk of the newborn large for gestational age macrosomia
and subsequent offspring at risk of future overweight obesity
Previous studies have shown that pregnancy obesity repre
sents a risk factor for GDM preeclampsia macro
somia and cesarean section
Among the new and more accurate techniques for pre
dicting adverse pregnancy outcomes the measurement of
maternal visceral adiposity using ultrasonography is becom
ing promising GDM outcome with measurements greater
than cm in the Armellini region distance from the linea
alba to the aortic cross in the maternal supraumbilical region
in the first weeks showed a significant odds ratio of
A similar study found a significant odds ratio of
among Armellini measurement greater than cm in non
obese prepregnant women Regarding the outcomes of
preeclampsia and premature birth with preeclampsia
Armellini region measurement above cm between
and weeks of gestation showed a significant relative risk
of and respectively even after control of concomi
tant pregnancy conditions
The study s main strength was the disease search at base
line and during the hospitalization process for labor and
delivery resulting in a GDM gestational hypertension and
preeclampsia double check Furthermore the study focused
in low risk pregnant women which simulates the majority
of outpatient care during pregnancy Here simple maternal
anthropometric measurements can become tools for
decision making in clinical practice routine
Limitations during the study unfortunately existed
including self reported prepregnancy weight reported by
some patients when weight information was not available
in first trimester prenatal records However several studies
demonstrated that using self reported weight in pregnant
women and young adults is valid Furthermore total
weight gain during pregnancy was obtained in approxi
mately of the sample This fact is due to the lack of rou
tine measurement of maternal weight during hospitalization
to labor and delivery
Conclusions
In summary the present study suggests that the use of adult
BMI thresholds among pregnant women may not be univer
sally applicable to all scenarios Instead adopting kg as
a cut off point threshold appears to be more effective in predict
ing adverse pregnancy related outcomes achieving a better bal
ance between sensitivity and specificity This allows for early
identification of pregnant women at risk for common metabolic
outcomes of pregnancy with superior accuracy Ultimately
early implementation of rigorous clinical and nutritional care
will lead to better maternal and perinatal outcomes
