etency statements The competencies were available in English French
and Spanish The team used the software platform Welphi https
www welphi com en which permitted respondents to complete the
questions anonymously at their own pace and provided spaces for
additional comments The team took note of feedback during the
consultation and the areas of disagreement and later modified the FP
and CAC competencies accordingly They then explored the nature and
characteristics of panelists with divergent views to identify whether
these represented a particular aspect of global diversity that had not
been adequately reflected and to rectify any gaps errors or areas that
could be better presented
As part of our analysis of the first round of the Delphi consultation
the team assessed the characteristics of the expert panelists to ensure
that they were globally representative They then analyzed the feedback
and made improvements to the competencies such as simplifying
clarifying and removing duplications Two members of the competency
development team reviewed the opinions of expert panelists who rated
the competencies the lowest to identify inconsistent negative responses
and to explore whether there were any groups sharing socio
demographic characteristics such as geography context occupation
who disagreed with the competencies No specific patterns emerged All
the comments associated with a particular competency were considered
and discussed with two team members until they agreed upon the
necessary changes Where necessary the team revised the competency
and the new version was consulted again with the panelists in Round
of the Delphi study Twelve competencies were rephrased as a result and
sent for further feedback Only panelists who had participated in Round
were invited to participate in Round to ensure continuity and
comparability of responses and so that responses were based on the
detailed understanding of the competencies In total panelists
completed Round and a further partially completed Round
According to Delphi methodology a consensus among partic
ipants is considered acceptable and in accordance with Delphi study
methodology
In the first round the Delphi achieved higher
consensus at greater than on each of the competencies Within the
Delphi methodology amendment can end once a high level of consensus
has been achieved Nevertheless the feedback had led to some suggested
changes and the team advanced these to the second round The
consensus rate in the second round was higher than in the first ranging
from to Therefore the original plan for a third round was
deemed unnecessary
Phase Third tier corroboration Town Hall meeting
Validation of the FP and CAC competencies took place in a hour
virtual Town Hall meeting on December The meeting was
chaired by HRP and included registered participants including FP
and CAC practitioners national and international FP and CAC interest
groups teachers and lecturers technical advisors officers and project
managers pharmacists and researchers The meeting was co hosted by
the WHO Prevention of Unsafe Abortion Unit and the WHO Contra
ception and Fertility Care Unit
Prior to the Town Hall meeting the competency development team
provided relevant documents to participants in English French and
Spanish versions of the competencies document were available upon
request Following the presentation of the draft competencies partici
pants discussed and submitted comments and questions through the
online chat facility A full set of questions with responses and proposed
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
changes to the competencies were collated after the virtual meeting and
shared with participants
Fig
The final version of the FP and CAC competencies resulting from the
collaborative and consultative process included FP and CAC com
petencies which are organized into ten domains The ten domains fall
into three competency groups attitudes professional compe
tencies and practice competencies
These compe
Fig
tencies can be used in conjunction with WHO guidelines that contain
recommendations on FP and CAC service delivery
They also
include a flexible menu for ease of use This menu also facilitates
contextualized adjustments to the local policy regulatory and health
systems contexts
Based on feedback during the Town Hall meeting the competencies
include reference to human rights standards in international law the
applicability of which in a specific setting will depend on factors such as
the State s ratification of relevant human rights instruments
Discussion
The Toolkit was developed with the ambition to strengthen FP and
CAC education and training with competency based performance
assessment The collaborative and consultative methodology under
taken to develop the FP and CAC competencies resulted in evidence
based competencies that allow for standardization and adaptability
across contexts By articulating critical competencies for FP and CAC
this Toolkit sets a global benchmark that encourages and supports health
workers and decision makers around the world to strive towards
harmonized high standards of services These competencies which are
based on recent evidence and guidelines including the WHO
Abortion Care guideline
will help set standards for education
training and performance
Attitudes or feelings values and beliefs are foundational to all
other competencies and influence their behavior and the performance
of all tasks undertaken in the health care context Stigmatizing attitudes
among health workers and others involved in the delivery of FP and CAC
hinders access to quality care and is a fundamental cause of health in
equalities
The FP and CAC competencies provide a shared
language about attitudes knowledge and skills needed in service de
livery The inclusion of attitudes as a fundamental competency for FP
and CAC is progress towards the reduction of stigma and normalization
of these services
In the development of the FP and CAC competencies the competency
development team adhered to a stepwise consultative process previ
ously used by many professional organizations to assure maximum
input from diverse sources professional areas of practice countries and
regions socio economic and cultural contexts The process undertaken
was rigorous and demonstrated strong consensus among a wide range of
stakeholders However there were some limitations to this process
Although the competency development team made efforts to be inclu
sive they may have overlooked key stakeholders and experts In the
consultative process the team provided the draft competencies in three
languages and encouraged comments in the language participants felt
most comfortable using As a result the team received comments in
French Spanish and Greek Nevertheless most of the consultation ac
tivities were in English This may have biased participation away from
non English speaking groups
The process we undertook to create and validate the FP and CAC
competencies was effective and offers a further model for the develop
ment of CBE tools We encourage the formation of non formal trans
national networks such as the one created for the development of these
FP and CAC competencies to share experiences tools applications and
feedback toward the uptake and continued improvement of the com
petencies and the Toolkit
Accelerating awareness uptake and use of the FP and CAC compe
tencies is of prime importance to improve performance of the primary
health workforce Most stakeholders are aware of the value of using

What were the consultation procedures leading to the development of the Competencies
document
A request for more information on micro credentials and informal elements of learning the
model
Questions and suggestions on how to disseminate and make the competencies work for any context
How to make discussion about FP and CAC provision safe on social media especially when those
communicators remove content from their platforms
How can we strengthen national ownership and accountability for implementation Because the
document is a guide so WHO Member States are not obliged to adopt them There is urgency to
implement so I have a suggestion for a resolution signed and adopted by regions and countries
How to use the competencies in those countries which have restrictive laws on abortion or forbid it
completely
Suggestion to use digital platforms to support dissemination which can be very effective channels
for the dissemination and implementation and involvement of Professional Associations in country
The need for advocacy to engage in promotion of those documents and also to lobby the social
media platforms not to block vital and research based information
What is your opinion of simulation within training
How to tackle illegal and dangerous informal provision of CAC services
Discussion on use of the phrase the fullest extent of the law in respect of clarity but also restrictive
nature of that phrase that doesn t take into account the international human rights standards that
the state is legally obligated to implement and health professional needs to take into account
sometimes forgetting their own private beliefs
Comments on accessibility of such extensive documents and the need to design them so they are
accessible for people with different abilities and using other languages
Comments on specific elements of the competency document
Fig Key questions raised in the Town Hall
competencies to improve education learning and practice in the health
sector
The FP and CAC competencies provide a menu of options from
which organizations institutions and service providers can choose the
set of individual competencies they require to focus on They may
identify a tailored set of competencies aligned with national or local
level health requirements and capacity gaps in the workforce Specific
language of the FP and CAC competencies can be adapted to local
contexts
Conclusion
Healthcare technology and systems are in constant flux and are
advancing rapidly Continued validation of professional competencies
and standards is essential to accommodate this ever changing environ
ment A single method for competency development and validation is
unlikely to satisfy the needs of all situations However the effective
processes and methods used here may provide guidance for others
interested in developing competencies and standards in SRH and
elsewhere

The impact of prenatal care on birth out
comes has been an area of subqantialSontro
versy in the public health qeld I A number of
indexes notably s Adequacy of
Prenatal Care Utilization APNCU
have been developed to study this issue
Less attention however has been directed to
evaluating the type of data used to calculate
measures of the use of prenatal care
Although vital statistics data are often
used as a sc rce of information on prenatal
care birth certificate records reflect the
Q ber s recollection of her prenatal care his
tory and her understanding of what consti
tutes a prenatal care visit Administrative data
provide an alternative source of such infor
mation These data offer the advantages of
eliminating patient recall as a potential
source of error and permitting specification
of the types of providers who deliver prenatal
care Care from diverse types of primary and
specialty providers during pregnancy may
have distinct benefits for women with chroTfi
diseases such as HIV infection who ave
increased risk of adverse birth outco es
In this retrospective cohort stu y we

Methods
Data
We studied Medicaid recipients in
New York State who delivered live born sin
gleton children between and who
were identified by a tested case finding
screen as HIV infected and who had claims
data linked to vital statistics records of
mothers For mothers with multiple deliver
ies in the study period one delivery was ran
domly selected The study population also
reflects the prior exclusion of mothers
who participated in programs that paid a
global fee for prenatal care since we could
not determine the number or type of their
visits
Birth outcomes served as the criteria for
our analyses Low birthweight was specified
as less than g and preterm birth was
defined as a gestational age of less than
weeks based on the physician s esti
mate or when the physician s estimate was
unavailable of cases the mother s esti
mate of her last menses
The APNCU index was calculated in
ways First we used data on prenatal care

the analysis inadequate prenatal care was
compared with all other levels i e ade

To control for possible confounders we
included several other maternal characteris
tics in our multivariate analyses Lacking
viral load and T lymphocyte data we
evaluated maternal HIV stage from diag
noses previously reported to be predictive of
maternal child HIV transmissio including
history of clinical DS pne monia or
anemia during pregnancy medical
conditions including hypertension asthma
and diabetes were also determined from
diagnoses on claims Illicit drug use was
measured by an approach that in previous
validation studies of claims data identified
of with illicit drug use noted
on charts Other demographic and behav
ioral covariates included age race ethnicity
marital status nativity US including Puerto
Rican vs foreign New York City resi
dence parity year of delivery educational
attainment and smoking and alcohol use
during pregnancy
Analysis
Simple K computed
to assess the chance corrected agreement
among the different measures of adequate
prenatal care These are interpreted in the
same way as intraclass correlation coeffi
cients To evaluate the relative strength of the
association between the variously specified
APNCU indexes and birth outcomes we
compared logistic regression models for
each outcome Each model included the
same covariates with I of the APNCU
indexes there were no significant interaction
terms and the adjusted odds ratio and
confidence interval were contrasted
Results
In of the deliveries the infants
were low birthweight a similar proportion
were preterm The proportion of mothers
with adequate prenatal care utilization var
ied from one half for the APNCU index
derived from vital statistics to two thirds for
the index based on visits to the most com
prehensive set of providers Table As
shown by the K statistic we observed poor
agreement between each of the claims
based APNCU indexes of prenatal care and
the birth certificate based APNCU index
Agreement among the claims based mea
sures was considerably better
The adjusted odds ratios for the types
of data source did not differ dramatically for
either birth outcome Table However the
APNCU measure based on visits to the most
comprehensive set of providers primary
care obstetrics gynecology and HIV special
ists consistently showed the strongest asso
ciation with a to reduction in the
adjusted odds of either birth outcome The
other indexes showed to reduc
tions in the odds of low birthweight How

Discussion
The assessment of adequacy of prenatal
care utilization based on birth certificate data
showed little agreement with that based on
claims Previous studies of the concordance
of prenatal care information fro
er
tificates and from other dat sources ve
shown simi lar poor agreem nt our
study measures we foun
t the most
comprehensive claims based APNCU index
had the strongest association with both low
birthweight and preterm birth
The APNCU measure developed by
Kotelchuck was not intended to take into
account care by providers other than those
directly involved
ell ering obstetric and
gynecologic ser es n considering visits
to other providers such as internists and HIV
specialists in a measure of adequacy of pre
natal care we may have classified some
women as having adequate prenatal care
when they actually had fewer obstetric visits
than recommended However we hypothe
size that visits to these other providers facili
tated detection and treatment of conditions
that could have had an adverse effect on birth
outcomes e g serious infections hyperten
sion severe anemia asthma or poor nutri
tion We cannot say whether a study of
healthy women or women with diseases other
than HIV infection would show a similar
advantage to considering care during preg
nancy delivered by providers other than
obstetricians
American Journal of Public Health
Our findings should prompt researchers
to consider the value of administrative data
in the examination of prenatal care adequacy
They should also lead researchers to recon
sider the Wpes of visits that should be included
in an evaluation of prenatal care utilization
or more accurately an evaluation of care
during pregnancy For women with chronic
diseases treatment from a broader set of
providers may contribute to improved birth
outcomes Z

Past studies of maternal home visitation
programs have feported attr tion rates rang
ing from to Although the primary
goal of most honie visitation studies is to
measure programmatic effects on infant mor
bidity and mortality investigators often face
difficulties estimating program benefits
when a substantial proportion of women drop
out earlier than expected
To date relatively few studies have
focused on examining the characteristics of
women who diol of prevention programs
prematurely of these studies have
focused on pregnant women at risk for poor
psychosocial functioning and none are spe
cific to maternal home visitation programs
Given the dearth of information concerning
the characteristics of program dropouts and
completers and the applicability of this
knowledge to program planning the present
study examined associations between
women s sociodemographic characteristics
perceived needs psychological functioning
substance use and informal social support
networks and their duration of participation
in a North Carolina matemal home visitation
program

INTRODUCTION
Malaria remains a persistent and life threatening
disease annually affecting millions and
significantly impacting mortality rates particularly
among children under five and pregnant women
contributing to nearly of recorded deaths in
hospitals and health centers The global
significance of malaria persists notably in
endemic countries such as Nigeria where
million people are at risk Caused by five
Plasmodium species
with
Plasmodium
falciparum being the most lethal malaria
continues to pose a significant public health
challenge prevalent in numerous African
countries Recent findings underscore Nigeria
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo s
substantial contribution accounting for over
of the estimated total deaths due to malaria
Globally malaria remains a devastating
international health concern with nearly
million new infections and million deaths
reported annually The impact is particularly
severe among children under five and pregnant
women in sub Saharan Africa where almost
of the annual mortality in this population is
attributed to malaria
Pregnant women residing in malaria endemic
regions pose a significant concern due to their
reduced immunity during pregnancy Moreover
in areas characterized by stable malaria
transmission a substantial number of malaria
cases during pregnancy exhibit no symptoms
The absence of symptoms in pregnant women is
attributed to acquired immunity from previous
exposures to malarial infections
Regrettably malaria poses a dual threat to both
the expectant mother and the developing fetus
Various regions in Nigeria have reported
divergent prevalence rates of malaria in
pregnancy ranging from to
Malaria can lead to adverse maternal outcomes
such as anemia hypoglycemia and in severe
cases maternal death Sub Saharan Africa alone
witnesses an estimated maternal deaths
annually due to malaria related anemia
Furthermore malaria significantly contributes to
low birth weight in infants due to compromised
nutrient delivery to the placenta
Malaria holds the top position among the seven
diseases initially targeted for global control or
eradication by the World Health Organization s
Tropical Disease Research TDR This
prioritization is due to the disease s significant
morbidity mortality rates diagnostic challenges
the absence of ideal drugs and effective
vaccines and other behaviors exhibited by its
vector
The impact of malaria extends beyond individual
health adversely affecting the physical mental
and social well being of communities along with
impeding the economic development of nations
Studies reveal that households spend up to one
thousand one hundred and twelve naira monthly
on malaria treatment presenting a considerable
financial burden particularly given the economic
status of the population
Despite efforts such as the Roll Back Malaria
program some reports suggest that government
led malaria control initiatives may face
challenges While certain African countries
experienced a reduction in malaria
incidence and deaths between and
due to high intervention coverage and effective
surveillance WHO World Malaria Report
Nigeria especially concerning malaria in
pregnancy has not shown similar progress The
minimal impact in Nigeria is attributed to
resource constraints Roll Back Malaria
Malaria is a formidable global public health
challenge particularly in African countries where
of the world s population resides in endemic
regions Approximately million pregnancies
Oladeji et al Asian J Preg Childb vol no pp Article no AJPCB
occur annually in malaria endemic areas of sub
Saharan Africa with notably high prevalence
among pregnant women and children under five
In Nigeria of pregnant women were
diagnosed with malaria according to the Federal
Ministry of Health in underscoring the
severity of the issue
In the southwestern region of Nigeria previous
studies have documented malaria parasite
prevalence rates ranging from to
among pregnant women Malaria during
pregnancy has been identified as a significant
contributor to maternal mortality causing up to
deaths annually Additionally it leads to
elevated
rates of maternal morbidity
characterized by symptoms such as fever and
severe anemia particularly affecting first time
mothers The impact extends to adverse
outcomes such as low birth weight and placental
parasitemia with an estimated to
infant deaths attributed to malaria infection
during pregnancy each year The detrimental
effects of malaria are most pronounced in the
first and second pregnancies of women residing
in areas of relatively stable transmission The
temporary depression of immunity facilitating the
development of the allograft fetus is cited as
one of the reasons for the heightened
susceptibility of pregnant women to malaria
In response to this public health challenge
Heads of Government and International
Agencies at the African Summit on Roll Back
Malaria RBM in Abuja in the year
declared a commitment to reducing the malaria
burden by at least by A widely
accepted measure in this endeavor involves the
utilization of Insecticide Treated Nets ITNs
in
especially
malaria endemic
regions
Consequently there has been the free
distribution of ITNs donated by the Roll Back
Malaria initiative targeting children under five
and pregnant women Despite decades of
research malaria in pregnancy MiP remains a
significant public health challenge that has
proven challenging to address Numerous
studies from regions with diverse malaria
transmission patterns have explored the impact
of MiP on both maternal health and birth
outcomes While the predominant consequence
of MiP on maternal health is often characterized
by anemia there is a scarcity of data concerning
malaria related maternal mortality Regarding the
fetus the most frequently observed adverse
effect of MiP is an elevated risk of low birth
weight LBW a critical factor associated with
impaired development and increased infant
mortality However many of these studies rely on
single measurement points typically from cross
sectional surveys or during delivery failing to
capture the multifaceted factors that influence
MiP over an extended period
Accurately assessing MiP is crucial for
understanding its effects on birth outcomes and
infant health but it poses challenges due to the
involvement of various factors that are
sometimes difficult to fully capture The
continuity or intermittency of MiP depends on
factors such as a woman s exposure to vectors
her level of immunity potential co infections
e g other malaria species HIV or helminths
and the efficacy of available treatment and
prevention
interventions
Achieving
of MiP
comprehensive
understanding
necessitates considering these diverse factors
that play a role over an extended timeframe
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Location
This study was conducted among women
attending antenatal care at four distinct hospitals
in Ikire Irewole Local Government Area of Osun
State The primary objective was to broaden our
understanding and collect pertinent data
essential for the study within Irewole Local
Government Established in through the
Local Government Reform Irewole Local
Government has its headquarters in Ikire
Subsequently Ayedaade Local Government and
Isokan Local Government areas were created in
and respectively from the original
Irewole Local Government
Irewole Local
Government shares boundaries with Ayedaade
Local Government in the East Ife North Local
Government in the Southeast and Egbeda Local
Government of Oyo state in the West Isokan
Local Government is located in the southwestern
part of Osun State with altitudes ranging
between meters and meters
above sea level Covering an area of
approximately square kilometers Irewole
Local Government comprises over villages
and hamlets
Based on the provisional headcount figure from
Irewole Local Government is estimated to
have a population of approximately The
study aimed to leverage the diverse healthcare
settings within the local government to enrich our
research experience and acquire pertinent data
for the specified investigation
