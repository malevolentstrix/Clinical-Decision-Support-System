a in endemic countries and
non endemic countries respectively these numbers do not include estimations of the
impact on mortality derived by in utero exposure to the disease Today approximately
million of individuals live in hotspots with a prevalence of cholera higher than
WHO Most of these hotspots are located in African countries and the
rest are located in the Middle East and Central Asia where the healthcare capacity
and quality is very poor Moreover the spread of cholera around the world is likely
to increase due to global warming Chowdhury et al Shope Emch et al
The cholera epidemic in Peru started in the early in the middle of an eco
nomic crisis Real GDP per capita fell circa between and Paxson
and Schady The situation of the health sector was also precarious Individuals
were supposed to have access to free healthcare including prenatal services labor
and delivery In practice however the capacity of the health sector was very limited
The public expenditure in health in was of the GDP one of the lowest from
Latin America at the time Many health centers did not function normally because of
a lack of personnel Pollarolo The travel costs for many individuals were sig
nificantly high given the long distances to the closest health center some times as far
as or more hours away INEI In addition there were important opportunity
costs in particular for informal workers the large majority of workers for whom a
day without working was a day without earnings
Naturally a health system like this was not prepared to deal with an epidemic
Many hospitals simply collapsed and the probability of a patient being rejected due

to lack of capacity or personnel increased significantly Here are some quotes that
reflect this situation
hospitals received a growing number of patients that was sometimes four
times greater than the number of bed and staff available In several cities staff
had to be taken from other hospital services to look after cholera some hos
pitals focused only on patients stricken with the disease and the physicians
requested the help of one relative per patient According to one physician from
Cajamarca hospital during the epidemic all doctors had to forget their original
specialty Cueto p
The emergency room of the hospital looked like a battlefield Sick
patients barely fit in the suffocating room Some of them were seated ted on
the floor other lying in beds and others many were left to lie on the floor
l The few nurses and auxiliary personnel extraordinarily called were insuf
ficient to assist the patients Several nuns with their white robes joined the
effort to attend patients In some cases even police officers became sponta
neously improvised nurses our translation from p
IN Valdivia Rey
The lack of capacity to attend patients during the cholera epidemic was very
generalized according to a nationally representative survey applied in October and
November only of people who were sick and wanted to get attention got
access to health services Pollarolo This evidence illustrates how the cholera
epidemic increased the costs of getting access to healthcare in that it eroded the
already limited capacity of the health sector increasing the patients waiting hours
and the probability of being rejected It is not surprising therefore that we find that
the cholera epidemic reduced prenatal care and institutional births
The epidemic reached suspected cases and a total of deaths a mor
tality rate of per inhabitants and per cases in the first year
and a total of accumulated suspected cases and accumulated deaths
by September By the end of the disease had spread to fourteen countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean totaling cases with Peru responsible
for of all cases presented in the Americas et al The epidemic
was caused by the bacterium Vibrium zero group Lanata The
means of contagion is through food handling and consumption with drinking water
being the most common vehicle of dissemination Gotuzzo Maguifia Vargas
et al Working age adults were disproportionally affected by the disease and
becoming infected with cholera typically resulted in medical expenses as well as to
days without working and Bradford
Figure I shows that the largest number of cases was reported in the number
decreasing over time with a peak of approximately per inhabitants per week
in the regions of the jungle The mortality rate was also much higher in as we
can see in Fig
As explained in the Introduction disease control experts could not explain why
cholera returned to South America in nor could they predict where it was going
Brookes In retrospect however several factors seemed to influence the inten
sity of the disease by region and time The first of these is the geographical location

and time of the first case The disease was first reported in the areas around the coastal
cities of Chancay Chimbote and Piura at the end of January Epidemiological
studies suggest that the massive contamination of phytoplankton and seafood in the
warm part of the sea in the North of Lima explains the explosive spread of the dis
eases Gotuzzo Maguifia Vargas et al In general cholera is more likely
to develop in coastal ecologies Collins Importantly this is believed to be the
first case not just the first diagnosis since adults and children had been tested for
some time before without any sign of the bacterium Vibrium Cholerae Gotuzzo
From these zones the epidemic advanced to other urban and rural areas of
Peru spreading from coast to the highlands finally penetrating the Peruvian jungle

in the first months of the year when it is summer on the coast it spread more homo
geneously over the year in the jungle where it is warm and humid all year around
and the incidence of cholera in the highlands is lower which is colder and drier all
year around
Naturally poor levels of basic sanitation with inadequate processing of drinking
water also seems to have influenced the expansion of the epidemic Gotuzzo
Maguifia Vargas et al Water even piped water was commonly not or not
sufficiently chlorinated and low water pressure and continuous breakdowns in the
service forced people to store water in containers where contaminations was even
more likely Untreated sewages emptied into the sea rivers and lakes or used to
irrigate agricultural land Cueto
Finally belonging to the human blood group O has been associated with increased
severity of the disease and approximately of the indigenous population in Peru

likely to be infected by the bacterium but the cholera toxin exerts a more potent
effect on cells expressing the blood type O associated glycan Harris et al The
relationship between blood type O and the severity of the disease has been confirmed
in very different settings and in the particular case of Peru in it was found that

Data and summary statistics
Our data make use of four sources of information The first source of data is the
Population Census of Peru of INEI which asks women age or older
whether their youngest child born alive is still alive It also asks the birth date month
and year of that child The mortality rate corresponds to the proportion of those
children by cohort and region who have died We restrict our sample initially to
years of cohorts to but in our main specification we narrow the sample
from to for reasons we will explain in Section
The second source of data is the Health and Demographic Survey DHS of
This dataset collects information on all children born alive in the previous years of
the survey and records whether or not they are still alive at the time of the interview
meaning we do not have to rely only on the youngest child in this case Moreover
this data set allows us analyze within siblings effects It also includes information of
parental investment and other nutritional and health question about the children We
also limit this data set to children born until
The third source of data provides information about the incidence of cholera reg
istered in Peru during the years to which was obtained from a report
produced by the General Directorate of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health of
Peru Ognio This information is disaggregated by week year and
region with the exception of Apurimac and Madre de Dios for which information is
lacking
Finally the fourth source of data is from Willmott and Matsuura which
provides terrestrial air temperature and precipitation information per month and
meteorological station which we match to regions
Table shows summary statistics of our sample of children corresponding to the
youngest child born between and to women age or older in Peru
has regions but as we mentioned above we only have data on cholera incidence
in of them There are a total of observations that result from collapsing the
data at the region month level We weight the means by the number of children born
alive per region and month
Children are on average years old The mothers are on average years old
are indigenous have an average of children in total years of educational
attainment and of them are illiterate Forty nine percent of the children have
piped water at home have access to a toilet or cesspit The average mortality
rate is I The average temperature and rainfall by trimester was oc and mm
respectively
The average cholera incidence during the third trimester in utero for those chil
dren born in is for children born before that year the incidence is zero
with a maximum incidence of The cholera incidence is calculated by dividing
the number of cases by the population of the region as of Cholera cases are
collected from diagnosis made on the basis of symptoms not blood tests This type

Naturally this type of diagnosis is not perfect either For example other acute diar

regions and that is captured in the census We do not collapse this data in order to
exploit the within sibling variation We weight the means using the sampling weights

Approximately half of the births are institutional births that is in public hos

More precisely of birth are at home are in hospitals health centers and
private clinics or offices and is others Approximately of births that occur in
medical institutions or health centers are assisted by a doctor or obstetrician On the
contrary less than of the births at home are assisted by a doctor Most of them are
assisted by a traditional midwife typically without license a relative or no body

with the date of each prenatal control as well as with special comments of the doc
tor for example whether the woman is experiencing problems with the pregnancy
This information represents a complement and a more objective measure than the
mothers report of whether they had prenatal controls Similarly reported having
had a tetanus vaccine The tetanus vaccine was during those years the only vaccine
required to be given to pregnant women It has a duration of years and it is typically
administered to the pregnant woman in her second or third trimester
Empirical strategy
We estimate three models We first apply a difference in difference DD approach
or more accurately a Fuzzy difference in difference De Chaisemartin and
d Haultfoeuille exploiting differences in the intensity of the cholera epidemic
by month and region Under certain conditions that we explain below this model esti
mate a Local Treatment Effect on the switchers or compliers We collapse the data
at the region month level and weight the regressions by the number of children born
alive per region and month In Appendices A and B we show the estimation using
total population as weights instead Our main specification is the following
t t t pm t r
where stands for the mortality rate as of July of Census interview date
of children born alive in month m and year t to women age or more in
who at the time of the census lived in region r Unfortunately we do not know the
region of residence when a given woman was pregnant with her treated child but in
Appendices A and B we estimate our results using only children born to women who
did not relocate during the years preceding the census between and
and our results are very similar
ChJrm t stands for the cholera incidence during the jth trimester in utero of the
child For example Ch
Ica represents the week incidence before April
in the region of Ica Our data does not provide day of birth so we assume all
children were born on the day of the month Our data also does not provide
information on gestational age at birth hence we assume weeks of gestation and
we follow the medical literature regarding the definition of the trimesters the first
trimester comprises weeks I to the second trimester comprises weeks to and
the third trimester comprises weeks to Exposure to cholera however could
have reduced gestational age at birth So in Appendices A and B we estimate our
regressions assuming and weeks of gestation
The medical literature affirms that third trimester is the most sensitive for cholera
cases Hirschhorn et al but we also estimate the effect of exposure to cholera
during the other trimesters to confirm this previous result In addition we estimate
the effect of exposure to cholera in the first trimester after birth because prenatal and
postnatal incidence of cholera might be correlated and postnatal exposure may also
have an effect on childhood mortality Cholera incidence of further away periods is
Springer
The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments childhood
less likely to be correlated with the incidence while in utero and less likely to affect
childhood mortality since typically around half of childhood mortality happens soon
after birth Finally we additionally estimate the effect of exposure to cholera in the
trimester before conception as a placebo test
pm t stands for month year of birth fixed effects Qnt r stands for month region fixed
effect d rtrend stands region specific trends and stands for control variables
ethnicity number of children which in this case is also the birth order age and
education of the mother whether or not they have access to piped water to a toilet or
cesspit and average temperature and rainfall by trimester in utero Standard errors are
clustered at the regional level Since we only have data from regions in the census
and regions in the survey we present the p values of wild bootstrap inferences to
correct for the small number of regions following Cameron et al
This empirical strategy addresses several potential sources of bias First of all
the regions fixed effects control for time invariable regional variables that might be
correlated with cholera infection and childhood mortality Second the region specific
trends control for the underlying trends in mortality which were already increasing
during those years in most regions The region month of birth fixed effects control
for regional specific seasonal variables that can be correlated with the intensity of
cholera and childhood mortality Finally the month and year birth effects control for
any potential nationwide shock that could affect mortality rates during those months
Month and year birth effects also control for differences in mortality by children age
As with any other DD application we assume that our results are not biased by
changes in unobservable variables that are correlated both with the cholera epidemic
and with childhood mortality As a way to increase the credibility of this assumption
in Appendix A we show with placebo regressions that our observable variables do
not vary meaningfully with the variation in cholera intensity that we exploit We also
restrict the sample to those born by the first semester of with the objective of
including only children who were conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic and
in this way rule out the possibility that our results are generated by selective fertility
In addition to the traditional assumptions a Fuzzy DD approach has two addi
tional assumptions a stable treatment effect over time and homogeneous treatment
effects for switchers of both treatment and comparison groups Our comparison
group are region months combinations that were affected by the cholera epidemic
in a smaller degree than the region months combinations from treatment group
In Appendix A we relax these assumptions and estimate Intertemporal Treatment
Effects following de Chaisemartin and D Haultfoeuille
Our second model is an event study similar to that of Cutler et al and Alpert
et al among others This non parametric model allow us to test whether the
intensity of the cholera epidemic was greater in regions and months in which child
hood mortality and our other outcomes were already growing The following is our
event study specification

Ch
stands for cholera incidence corresponding to the last trimester in utero
of the child of region r born in month m of year Thus gives us the effect
on mortality of a percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children
who effectively were in utero in while Fl gives us the effect on mortality of a
I percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children who were in utero
in a year before the epidemic started gives us the effect on mortality of a
I percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children who were in utero
in years before the epidemic started and so forth It is important to note that
even in the absence of pre existing trends for t are not necessarily equal
to because they give us the effect on mortality of postnatal exposure to cholera
However the largest part of childhood mortality happens in the first year of life and
so most of the children that die in our sample has already died before their first
year of life and so for t should be noisier and probably smaller than the
effect of the exposure while in utero More importantly if the event study shows no
long term trend in increasing mortality rates leading up to the cholera epidemic then
that is evidence that our effects are not endogenously driven by omitted variables
correlated with the spread of the epidemic
Finally we estimate a third model with the survey data applying the same DiD
strategy but including a mother s fixed effects Working with this data and empirical
strategy has advantages and disadvantages The main disadvantage is that we have
considerably less statistical power for our estimations first we only exploit within
sibling variation second the data contains a representative but small sample of the
population and third the data is divided in larger regions instead of the Hence
we lose much of the cross sectional variation
The main advantage of this augmented empirical strategy and additional data set
is that it removes several of the concerns that we have with our first model and data
First of all this model controls for selection at the mother s level As we have seen
in the Introduction while not even experts seemed to have anticipated the cholera
epidemic at that precise time with our DD model we cannot completely discard the
possibility that the effects are driven by differences in the sample of women who gave
birth during the cholera epidemic With this third model however we control for
such potential differences Second with the census data we estimate only the effect
on last born child hence should we not want to assume the same average treatment
effect between last born and early born children our first model estimates a Local
Treatment Effect LATE on last born children With this third model and data how
ever we include all children age to irrespective of whether or not they were last
born I lence the external validity of this model is greater Third since the data we use
to estimate this model was collected at the end of and at the beginning of
it reduces the likelihood that the region of residence is other than the native region
of children exposed to the epidemic Finally with this data we observe the age of
death and hence we can estimate the effects on mortality by age of death For more
robustness and sensitivity tests on this model please see our Appendix B
Before concluding this empirical section we would like to make a final note about
our main regressor Other studies use maternal infection rate as the main regressor
for example Almond Unfortunately we do not have mother s infection rate
or infection by gender or age However we believe our regressor cholera incidence

at the regional level is a more appropriate way to address our research question
With the Covid epidemic we now know more than ever that an epidemic can
affect individuals not just through the disease itself but through other mechanisms
We believe this is part of our contribution to the literature By exploiting the variation
of the cholera incidence at the regional level we incorporate the potential effects
of for example the saturation of the health infrastructure of a region This can be
particularly harmful for pregnant women that need attention several times during
their pregnancies and of course during the delivery This is especially true in poor
countries and was especially true during the cholera epidemic in Peru as we have
seen above
Results from census data
Table presents the estimated effects of exposure to cholera on childhood mortality
according to different specifications The first column shows the effects of estimat
ing the difference in difference specification for the entire period between January
and July We estimate the effect of the three trimesters in utero All
regressions include birth month year and month region fixed effects region specific
trends and control for ethnicity birth order or number of children born alive age
and education of the mother whether they have access to piped water to a toilet and
temperature and rainfall by trimester p values of wild bootstrap inferences shown
in parentheses and confidence intervals shown in brackets According to the
first column exposure during the trimester has the greatest effect on childhood
mortality an increase of standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by percentage
points which represents and increase of or standard deviations The med
ical literature also affirms that the third trimester is the most sensitive for cholera
cases Hirschhorn et al We also find that an increase of standard deviation
in the incidence of cholera during the first trimester in utero increases average child
hood mortality rate by percentage points which represents and increase of
or standard deviations Finally we find that an increase of I standard deviation
in the incidence of cholera during the second trimester in utero decreases average
childhood mortality rate by percentage points This result might seem odd at
first however this is actually possible it could be the result of miscarriage and of
the surviving children being a healthier sub set of the total cohort Selective mortal
ity miscarriage has been noticed by many researchers Bozzoli et al Currie
and Vogl In fact according to Saona et al most miscarriages due to
cholera infection in Peru occurred during the first and second trimester of pregnancy
In the rest of the columns we estimate the same regression but restricting our
data to the period between January and December By including only the
first year of the epidemic we reduce the possibility of selective fertility Moreover
since the epidemic was quite unexpected when it appeared but over time individuals
in particular educated individuals became aware of the illness and learned ways to
prevent it we would expect that the effect is less likely to be endogenous in the first
year of the epidemic In Appendices A and B we restrict the sample even further

The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments childhood
to those born by the first semester of with the aim of including only children
conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic In column we can see that the effect
of exposure to cholera during the third trimester remains statistically significant in
all the specifications In the case of exposure to cholera during the second trimester
the negative effect is no longer statistically significant and in the case of exposure
to cholera during the first trimester the coefficient is statistically significant only
in some of the specifications Columns and show the estimates of exposure to
cholera only during the third and first trimester respectively In particular we can
see that the estimate for the exposure during the third trimester is very insensitive
to controlling for the incidence during other trimesters This result is not surprising
given that the intensity of cholera varied significantly within regions over time even
within months and given that we are working with census data and therefore have
good statistical power
In column we show the effect of exposure during the weeks in utero and
we can see a significant effect on mortality an increase of standard deviation in
the incidence of cholera during the weeks in utero increases average childhood
mortality rate by percentage points or
Column includes the estimation of the effect of cholera during the first trimester
after birth It is somewhat surprising that postnatal exposure during the first trimester
after birth does not affect childhood mortality rate However we need to keep in
mind that typically of childhood deaths happen in the first month after birth
and a third of neonatal deaths occur in the first day of life This means that some
of the children in our sample were not actually exposed to postnatal incidence of
cholera because they were already dead after the first month In fact we will see in
the next section that there is a significant effect on first day mortality Another expla
nation could be that breastfeeding reduced babies exposure to the epidemic There
is evidence that mothers respond in this way to protect babies from contaminated
water Keskin et al This does not have to be a premeditated response since
breastfeeding is very generalized during the first trimester of life
Finally in column we include as a placebo the estimation of the effect on mor
tality of cholera during one trimester before conception It is reassuring to find no
significant effect but this result is not sufficient to prove causality During the
and early Peru was going through a very bad economic situation including an
increase in infant mortality Baird et al Paxson and Schady Hence our
results could be driven by a previous trend Figure shows event study for exposure
during the third trimester and we can see however that there is no previous trend in
those regions and in those months with higher incidence of cholera in in com
parison with the rest of regions and months This result provides good evidence that
our estimation is causal Moreover Fig presents an event study of maternal edu
cational attainment as a placebo test that provides evidence that there was no sample
selection in the mothers of children affected in greater magnitude by the epidemic In
Appendix A we show more placebo tests and robustness checks that increase even
further the reliability of our results The event study for exposure during the first
trimester in Fig shows what we were observing in the regressions a much noisier
and mostly non significant effect on mortality

These results are most likely a lower bound estimate for several reasons first
the epidemic likely generated a sizable number of miscarriages which tend to be
concentrated among those who are physically weakest meaning the survivors will
tend to be a healthier subpopulation Bozzoli et al Currie and Vogl
Second the epidemic killed a large number of adults meaning pregnant women who
survived a cholera infection were probably the healthiest and our sample does not
contain information on motherless children Third we do not have the age of death
for children and we observe only whether children have died before mid and
the epidemic started in Hence we can only see whether the children affected
by the epidemic died at age or before and some children might have died after
reaching that age

Table shows heterogeneous effects by poverty The level of poverty by district
is defined by the proportion of households with at least one unsatisfied basic need
which was calculated by the INEI from the Census We define poor districts
as districts with a larger proportion of poor households than the median district As
expected the effect of exposure to cholera during the third trimester on mortality is
greater among poorer districts Interestingly though the effect of exposure to cholera
during the first trimester on mortality is greater among the less poor districts This
last result could be derived from a smaller number of miscarriages among the less
poor districts which in turn reduces the selection effect
Table also shows heterogeneous effects by maternal education We define
women with high educational attainment as those women with educational attain
ment higher than the median and women with low educational attainment as those
women with educational attainment lower than the median Again as expected the
effect of exposure to cholera during the third trimester on mortality is greater among
children of less well educated mothers
Results from survey data
In this section we present the results from the estimations using the survey Data
DHS One of the shortcomings of this data aside from the obvious fact that
it is a survey and therefore has significantly fewer observations than a census is
that the configuration of regions in this data is different than in our cholera data and
in the census data the country is divided in larger regions instead of the We
thus lose much of the cross sectional variation With this data however we have the
advantage of knowing the age of death and we can estimate within siblings effects

data In the first column we show the result of running the difference in difference

just as we did with the census data As expected our estimate is significantly less
precise the point estimate of exposure to cholera during the third trimester is approx
imately times larger but it is not statistically significant Columns to show the
effects of estimating the within siblings effect on total mortality on mortality in the
first months of life on mortality in the first month of life and on first day mortality
respectively We concentrate on early life mortality only because at the time of the
survey approximately half of the children born in were less than months old
We can see that including the mother fixed effect approximately triplicates the esti
mate and limiting the age of death to months or less increases the significance We
find that an increase of I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last
trimester in utero increases three month mortality by percentage points or
and first day mortality rate by percentage points or This last result is very
interesting and suggests that a significant part of the deaths might have occurred due
to complications at birth The magnitude of the effects are large but so are the con
fidence intervals the effects represents only and of a standard deviation of
three month mortality and first day mortality respectively Also this is a sample of
mothers less well educated as we saw in the summary statistics
Table shows the effect of the epidemic on some fetal health indicators following
Goodman Bacon sex composition low and very low birth weight size and
gestational age Column shows the effect on the sex composition of children born
alive We do not observe a statistically significant effect on the probability of a child
being born female but we cannot dismiss this possibility out of hand Column
shows the effect on low birth weight Unfortunately only about half of households
answered this question We do not find any significant effect on low birth weight in
our data there are no children with a very low birth weight nor any effect on the
perceived size of the baby at birth as shown in columns and or in the likelihood
of being premature as shown in column In column we follow Kling Liebman
and Katz Anderson and Hoynes et al and construct a summary
indicator for fetal health with the objective of increasing the statistical power of
our estimation This indicator is the simple average across standardized measures of
each component low and very low birth weight size and whether the child was a
preterm baby The standardization of each variable is made by subtracting the mean
and dividing by the standard deviation Since all the indicators of fetal health are
negative we multiply the indicator by to get a positive indicator We can see that
there is no significant effect on this indicator either
Table presents the estimated effects on prenatal investments We find no signif
icant effect on the number of prenatal visits but exposure to cholera during the third
trimester in utero reduces the probability of having an prenatal card and of a mother
having had a tetanus shot in the last years Column shows that exposure to cholera
during the third and first trimester in utero reduces the likelihood of an institutional
birth by percentage points or In column we construct another summary
indicator this time for prenatal investment with the objective of increasing the
statistical power of our estimation This indicator is the simple average across stan

find that I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last trimester in
utero decreases prenatal investment by standard deviations These results sug
gest that childhood mortality in particular first day mortality could have been driven
at least in part by the lack of skilled care during pregnancy and birth
With respect to the potential magnitude of the effect of prenatal investments on
mortality the effects for example of institutional births on mortality rates esti
mated by previous studies are significantly large between and Daysal

b We find that I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
last trimester in utero reduces institutional births by percentage points Based
on previous studies we would expect an increase in mortality between and
percentage points which corresponds very closely to our estimates I lence a large
proportion of the first day mortality and to a lesser extent month mortality could
be explained by the effect of the cholera epidemic on institutional births and more
generally prenatal investments

first trimester decreases weight for age by standard deviations and increases the
likelihood of being underweight by percentage points or respectively
Tables and show heterogeneous effects In these tables we do not show
the coefficients of the exposure to cholera during the second trimester in order to
save space and focus the attention on our main results We cannot identify districts
in the survey data which is why we cannot construct the heterogeneous effect by
poverty with this data but in this data we observe maternal education and sex of the
child Table shows heterogeneous effects by education The effects on total mortal
ity estimated with the census data month mortality and severe diarrhea estimated
with the survey data are concentrated among children of less well educated mothers
The effect on prenatal investments however is larger for children of better educated
women and the effect on day mortality does not show much difference by edu
cation One potential explanation for these results is that on the one hand the effects
on total mortality month mortality and severe diarrhea are mostly driven by the
impact of the disease while in utero which presumably affected less well educated
women to a greater degree On the other hand the effect on first day mortality is
driven by a combination of the impact of the disease and the impact on prenatal
investments and the latter presumably depends more on the saturation of the health
system in populated areas where women tend to be more educated
A similar pattern can be seen in Table the effects on month mortality and
severe diarrhea are concentrated among female children The effect on prenatal

investments however is larger for males and the effect on day mortality does
not show much difference by sex Larger results for females are not uncommon in
the fetal origins literature This result is typically attributed to stronger fetal sur
Vival for women and a positive selection effect among surviving boys Dagnelie
et al There is not obvious explanation of why the effect of on prenatal invest
ments seems larger for males but again the lack of differential effect by sex on
first day mortality might be explained by the fact that this mortality is driven by a
combination of the impact of the disease while in utero and the impact on prenatal
investments
Magnitude of the effects and estimation of the additional deaths
from the epidemic
With the census data we find that a percentage point incidence of cholera dur
ing the last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by
percentage points With the survey data results are much larger in magnitude but
also significantly less precise Applying the same methodology the point estimate
is approximately five times larger and it is not statistically significant Applying
the fixed effect methodology we find that I standard deviation in the incidence of
cholera during the last trimester in utero increases month mortality rate by
percentage points If we look at the effects in terms of standard deviations the mag
nitudes are not so different from each other with the census data we find an increase
on total childhood mortality of standard deviations while with the survey data
we find an effect on three month mortality of standard deviations Assuming
the difference between the census estimate and the survey estimate using the same
methodology give us the magnitude of the imprecision of the survey estimates we
would expect that the true effect is five times smaller that is approximately per
centage points or As a comparison Jayachandran finds that the wildfires
in Indonesia during the months in late and early caused an increase in the
under three mortality rate of assuming half of the deaths were miscarriages
Rocha and Soares find that I standard deviation increase in rainfall gener
ates a decrease of in infant mortality rate and Banerjee and Maharaj find
that excessive heat during pregnancy days on average increases infant mortality

cholera epidemic in Peru is in every inhabitants while our estimated mor

alive in The striking difference in these numbers shows that in utero exposure
to an epidemic can be more deadly than postnatal exposure Naturally this will vary
from epidemic to epidemic cholera might affect children in utero much more than
other diseases Nevertheless we have seen that lack of prenatal investment is also an
important driver of the effect on mortality This means that even if the disease has no
direct effect on the fetus the economic consequences of the epidemic as well as the
saturation of the health system can impose severe consequences in terms of childhood
mortality
Concluding remarks
Epidemics have been on the rise for the past several decades and will likely continue
to do so in the near future Much of the economic literature has focused on the conse
quences of viral outbreaks Influenza V Ebola in spite of the fact that
the number of bacterial outbreaks have increased as much as have the number of viral
outbreaks and the two most common outbreaks in the last two decades have been
bacterial outbreaks Salmonellosis and cholera Smith et al Poor countries
in particular are highly vulnerable to bacterial infections given the high prevalence
of antibiotic resistance WHO and more generally given their lack of access
to basic health services clean water and sanitation WB In this study we find
that an increase in standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last
trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by approximately
according to our most conservative estimate This means that the human cost of the
epidemic was approximately larger if we consider the effect of prenatal expo
sure on postnatal childhood mortality Moreover the official mortality rate from the
cholera epidemic in Peru during is in every inhabitants while our
estimated mortality rate due to prenatal exposure is in every children
that were born alive in
We further find that the epidemic increased first day mortality and reduced prenatal
care and institutional deliveries and that later mortality is concentrated among girls Addi
tionally we find that surviving children are more likely to suffer from severe diarrhea
have lower weight for age and are more likely to be underweight These results
provide evidence that prenatal investments in particular prenatal care and institu
tional deliveries can act as mediators between the in utero shock and the effect
on childhood mortality and possibly also on surviving children s health status and
even longer term outcomes Epidemics in particular but also many other shocks that
have been analyzed in the fetal origins literature droughts wars famines and hurri
canes among other things have the potential to affect access to skilled care during
pregnancy and birth hence the results of this paper can apply to a wide range of
shocks
