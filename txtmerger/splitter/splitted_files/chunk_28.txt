Given the increasing involvement of families in child protection processes pre birth and during infancy it is imperative that we have greater evidence of child
protection processes during this period A court file review was used to determine the characteristics and issues for families who are going through care proceedings
for their infants the outcomes of court proceedings and the safety plans required for families Of the court files analysed of the families were reported to
child protection prenatally and were reported postnatally One in five infants were removed into care directly from the maternity ward with the average age of
removal being months The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence drug and alcohol use and mental health issues The
majority of these cases resulted in final orders with a large proportion having until protection orders and having orders revoked or withdrawn
allowing the infant to be reunified to the family The complexity of issues of the cases in these care proceedings highlights the need for greater sophistication in
strategies to support these families who cross multiple service systems to enable reunification of families and prevention of removals
Introduction
Infant removals into out of home care by the child protection system
are a highly emotive and complex issue In Australia infants are the age
group with the highest rates of child maltreatment substantiation and
entry into out of home care Australian Institute for Health and Welfare
Internationally increases in infant child protection involvement
have been seen in England New Zealand and the United States
Pearson
et al
In Australia the over representation of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander hereafter respectfully called Aboriginal infants is
a cause of great community concern and the over representation of
Aboriginal children involved in child protection is a priority target for
reduction by the Australian Government in the National Agreement on
Closing the Gap Commonwealth of Australia Given the high
level of child protection involvement during the perinatal period this
requires a special focus for policy and practice to enable improved
outcomes for families and infants
Internationally there is great variability regarding the legal status of
a fetus and the statutory powers of child welfare protection systems of
pregnant mothers Some countries and jurisdictions within countries
including United States and England have powers to place birth alerts
on unborn babies or to notify pregnant mothers to child welfare services

Ward et al
In Australia a number of states such as Western
Australia WA New South Wales and Queensland have legislation
which gives child protection systems the statutory power to receive and
investigate child protection notifications of pregnant mothers Depart
ment of Communities New South Wales Government In
WA pregnant mothers can be notified to the Department of Com
munities Child Protection and Family Support when an unborn child is
identified as at risk of abuse and or neglect Following investigation
these notifications may be substantiated and pre birth planning may
commence to address safety concerns with the family of the unborn child
which will usually involve parents their family and safety networks the
Department of Communities WA Health and in some cases the parent s
legal representatives In terms of time frames it is recommended that
these meetings are held in the and week of gestation
The aims of pre birth planning meetings include developing action plans
during pregnancy and following birth including preparation for the
infant e g securing safe accommodation evidence of behavioural
change to address concerns raised by the Department developing and
enacting a personal safety plan relating to family and domestic violence
and developing a safety network of people Department of Communities

In WA during there were unborn children receiving
child protection services and infants
Australian Institute for
Notifications that were substantiated
Health and Welfare
involved unborn children and infants with infants
admitted into out of home care Child protection case workers have the
statutory authority to decide whether there is an immediate and sub
stantial risk of harm to a child s well being and to take the child into
provisional protection and care This requires the child protection
department to apply to the court for a protection order
Following an application to the Children s Court by the Department
due to an infant being considered at substantial risk of harm the court
can decide that the child is not in need of protection or it can make one
of four potential orders a protection order supervision where the child
stays with the family but is supervised by the Department a protection
order time limited where the child is placed in the care of the
Department for up to two years a protection order until where the
child is placed in care until they are years old or a protection order
Special Guardianship Order where the child is placed with a carer
other than the Department until they are years old Department of the
Attorney General The Department submits evidence to the court
to support the protection and care application which typically includes
the requirements of parents to address safety plans
There is currently no research literature on the requirements of
families pre post birth to meet safety requirements of the Department or
the outcomes of these care proceedings The literature that is available
around infants in care proceedings is from England which found that
infants aged less than year constituted of all children in care
proceedings with the largest proportion of infants being newborn
weeks old Almost half of all newborns recorded the final legal order
outcome as placed for adoption with placed with extended
family and placed with parents on supervision orders
Broad
hurst et al In New Zealand a rise in infant removal legal orders
was reported until with a reduction in orders from to
following the Hawkes Bay case
Keddell et al
This sentinel event
in drew media and community attention to the ethical and pro
cedural issues of the use of interim orders a without notice removal
order involving babies This resulted in several enquiries
including a review of the use of interim orders which subsequently
led to a reduction in removals
Given the increasing involvement of families in child protection
processes pre birth and during infancy it is imperative that we have a
greater understanding of child protection and court outcomes for fam
ilies subjected to care proceedings as well as the requirements placed on
families for orders to be revoked and potential reunification Therefore
this study aims to determine the characteristics and issues for families
who are going through care proceedings for their infants the outcomes
of court proceedings and the safety plans required for families by using a
court file review
Method
This study is a court file review conducted in of cases
from a random sample of WA Children s Court case files for families
experiencing a child protection removal of their child into out of home
care within the child s first year of life The study sample criteria
included cases where an infant had court proceedings and was placed
into out of home care within days from birth in WA Court files from
the year was chosen from which to select cases so that we could
follow up proceedings to the latest finalised court proceeding as of
In WA there were infants aged year admitted to care
and protection orders in with approximately half the cases
being Aboriginal Australian Insitute of Health and Welfare The
final sample for which data was extracted were infant cases which is
of cases Mixed methods analysis was used to conduct a quanti
tative analysis of the court file data and a qualitative analysis of safety
plan requirements within the court files
Children and Youth Services Review
Variables and pro formafor data collection
Data was accessed and extracted from the case files using a proforma
designed for the study and entered into SPSS The pro forma was
developed from similar studies and policy documents then revised
through consultation with Court staff and pilot data collection from the
Court files Variables were chosen to describe the characteristics of the
cases services utilised and factors associated with child protection
involvement Information on both parents and infants were extracted
and relevant information regarding placements and court outcomes
Parent characteristics
Demographics Characteristics of both parents including de
mographic factors such as age and ethnicity Aboriginality or non
Australian
Parents Own Abuse History Parents own child protection history was
collected where possible
Mental Health The recorded mental health status of parents was
collected from the proceedings and or supporting information filed by
parents or child protection services Parents mental health status was
collected as an indicator of mental health issues whether it was an
official diagnosis self reported by the parents or documented by
caseworkers
Criminal involvement Parents current and historical criminal
involvement was included where it was noted on the file that they were
incarcerated and or on parole during child protection proceedings
Pre and post natal notifications to child protection services Information
on the prenatal and postnatal notifications to child protection services
and the areas of safety concerns were recorded based on available
information
Services Services parents were referred to or involved with to
ascertain support parents were provided in relation to child protection
concerns
Infant characteristics
Demographics The infant s age at removal their sex Indigenous
status and number of siblings The infant s age at removal was ascer
tained by calculating the difference between the infant s date of birth
and the date they were assumed into care or removed
Safety plans
In WA safety plans are developed with families where there are
substantiated child protection concerns The court files contained in
formation on the safety plan requirements for families
Data analysis
The quantitative data was analysed using SPSS with descriptive
statistics reported The qualitative information on safety plan re
quirements was recorded in the proforma and entered into NVIVO The
safety plan requirements were coded and thematically analysed using
NVIVO Braun and Clarke Two researchers coded the data to
identify areas of concern and requirements for parents in the safety plan
Inter rater reliability was determined by cross checking identified codes
and themes across the safety plan requirements for the cases
Ethics
Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Western
Australia Human Research Ethics Committee RA
Approvals to access court files and extract information on site were
provided to researchers by the President of the WA Children s Court and
the Justice Research Application and Advisory Committee
M O Donnell et al
Results
Of the court files analysed there were more male than female
infants with similar proportions of Aboriginal and non Aboriginal in
fants see
Tablel
Infants were removed into care from less than a week
to up to months but on average at months The majority of in
fants had siblings with a large proportion having an elder sibling
in care On average families had children removed
Of the cases of the families were reported to child protec
tion prenatally and reported postnatally
There was vari
Fig
ation in the outcomes of the final orders with having an until
protection order reunified with family and placed on a
special guardianship order
Of those cases with a prenatal report were placed on protection
orders until on protection orders years on special
guardianship orders the order was revoked and infant was
placed on a supervision order with a parent
The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence
drug and alcohol use and mental health issues
Half of the infants were placed in foster care and the other half
Table
in kinship care placements The Department had legal representation in
of cases with of mothers having legal representation in final
orders and fathers a lesser extent at Only a small proportion of
cases had a parental affidavit on file
Safety Reunification planning
For mothers who are pregnant or parents who have an infant where
there are concerns about safety and wellbeing the Department will meet
with parents to develop a safety plan According to the Department of
Communities Departments Child Protection Practice Manual safety
planning is a proactive structured and monitored process that provides
parents with an opportunity to demonstrate that they can address the
Departments concerns by providing safety for their child Department
of Communities It is a process which takes place between a child
protection case worker parents may contain people within the safety
network and if appropriate the child The process usually involves a
written plan to address the Department s concerns of harm or potential
harm during pregnancy or for a child through the development of safety
goals
In the court case files the majority of the cases had safety plans on
court files The requirements for parents were coded into the
matic areas Requirements were fairly consistent across the files
regarding concerns that were required to be addressed which are out
lined below Table
Actively engage with Departrnent
A large proportion of cases had a requirement that parents
would actively engage with the Department and was stipulated explic
itly in parents safety plans
Engaging with Department Task respond to all calls home visits
letters and text messages and attend all meetings Inform case
manager ASAP if contact details change or there are difficulties
attending a scheduled appointment Goal To be actively engaged
with the Department attend all meetings attend all arranged con
tacts with infant to work towards reunification Case
Continue to engage appropriately with the Department For
example be respectful attend meetings advise if they cannot attend
meetings and contact Continue positive contact If contact does not
occur at no fault of the parents there will be a make up contact
Case
To ensure engagement with the Department there were a small
number of safety plans that stipulated specifically mobile phones Two
plans required the parents to

A number of parents were required to demonstrate the ability
to manage finances in order to provide for their children and to meet
their children s needs In some cases parents were required to undergo
financial counselling and or voluntary income management particularly
if they were not able to successfully demonstrate an ability to budget
There were also examples in which parents were instructed not to seek
financial assistance from family or the Department Examples include
Mother to demonstrate ability to manage finances appropriately
and responsibly that will enable her to provide for the children

stipulated a requirement to obtain and maintain stable safe hygienic
accommodation Wording typical of this requirement was
to obtain and maintain stable safe hygienic accommodation for
children Case
Some parents in their safety plan requested assistance from the
Department for accommodation which included parents who were being
released from prison and mothers who were trying to obtain housing
accommodation due to domestic violence
Father has requested assistance with accommodation following

were clear in plans that while referral information would be provided
the onus was on parents to obtain housing and address issues that led to
homelessness

have led to her homelessness Case
Department will provide information relating to support agencies
and a support letter to Department of Housing relating to priority list
Mother expected to source permanent accommodation herself

n
A large group of parents had safety plans that had re
quirements around domestic violence Some parents were required to
end a relationship with an abusive partner and not to enter in any further
relationships with abusive partners The onus in these safety plans
appeared to be on mothers who experienced domestic violence to ensure
they do not have a relationship with an abusive partner or potential
partner There were also stipulations to notify police if violence occurs
or a Violence Restraining Order VRO was broken Examples of these
requirements include
No physical contact with a male mentioned Case no further
incidents of domestic violence including with any new partners or
other people Case To increase frequency or duration of con
tact with children parents must cease being involved in a domestic
violence relationship Case and Mother will need to demon
strate she has the capacity to protect children from being exposed to
violence Case
and
Mother to report to police if physically assaulted or attacked and for
her not to engage in any violence or assaults Case and report
all breaches by father of VRO or other orders to the police Case
Some safety plans required children to go to someone in their safety
support network or for fathers to walk away to avoid domestic violence
incidents
Children and Youth Services Review
Parents agree to stop arguing and for father to walk away from
mother to avoid further incidents Case
If parents argue children will go to grandparents Aunty s house or
father will go for a walk to cool off Case
Mother and father will continue to protect children from violent
environments If they argue father will leave the caravan to allow
the situation to cool down Bottom line If there continues to be
violence in front of the children the Department may recommend
that father leaves the family home until this issue is addressed
Case
Parents were often required to complete FDV or anger management
programs or counselling with more specific goals of demonstrated un
derstanding of domestic violence and safety planning Typical safety
requirement for mothers were
For mother to be ready for reunification she needs to Complete an
anger management program and demonstrate ability to manage
conflict problem solve understand cycle of violence power and
control and impact of DV on children No further DV reports or vi
Olent behaviours If father perpetrates violent behaviour mother is to
take protective steps as per safety plan Case
Domestic Violence Task attend DV counselling programs Goal
obtain a positive report from counsellors regarding mother s
participation and understanding of the effect of DV on children
Mother will need to demonstrate she has the capacity to protect
children from being exposed to violence Case
Parents will ensure that the children are not exposed to FDV and
will sort out their problems in a non violent way so that children will
become healthy happy adults that will learn to resolve conflict in a
nonviolent manner Mother no reports of violence from the police
or community with father or any other family or community mem
bers DV counselling to address issues related to DV including being
a victim of DV and her understanding of the impact of DV on chil
dren living in environment which it occurs Case
Mother to provide environment free from verbal and physical
violence by attending and participating in therapeutic intervention
re DV meeting with Dept workers to discuss and demonstrate un
derstanding of DV develop detailed personal safety plan for herself
and child report all breaches by father of VRO or other orders to the
police Dept will refer mother to DV program and fund any associated
costs Dept will also consider referral to Safe at Home service if
mother secures her own accommodation Case
Similarly for fathers particularly where fathers were perpetrators of
violence there were cases of specific requirements regarding courses and
programs as well as demonstrated understanding and behaviours
For father to be ready for reunification he needs to Participate in an
anger management and DV program and demonstrate he has
addressed his issues with DV anger management and impulse con
trol for a period of time determined by the Dept Case
Father no reports of violence from the police or community with
mother or any other family or community members Behaviour
Change program to address his role in DV including being a
perpetrator of DV a victim of DV and his understanding of the
impact of DV on children living in the environment in which it oc
curs Case
Father to provide environment free from verbal and physical
violence Father to demonstrate alternate strategies apart from use of
violence and that he understands impact of violence on safety and
wellbeing of child by participating in men s behaviour change
program following release from prison and allowing Dept to seek info
regarding participation and engagement from program provider
demonstrate ability to follow and abide by orders and instructions
issued by CPFS Corrective Services and Police Case
M O Donnell et al
Drug and alcohol
A large number of parents had requirements in relation to
drugs and alcohol in their safety plans
Some cases stipulated that Children will be in a home where there is
always a sober adult to look out for their safety and ensure that all their
basic needs are met Case Other cases the Department stated that
Parents wont drink alcohol when caring for children If father wants to
drink more than drinks he will go to his father s house and return when
sober If mother wants to drink she will do the same at her family s
house Case
A large proportion specifically had requirements around
urinalysis and drug testing with variable requirements ranging from
random urinalysis testing to weekly testing Examples included
Random urinanalysis Mother required to attend same day as
request Father Should he wish to have supervised visit he would
need to undergo drug screening Case
Task complete random urinalysis weekly Goal To abstain from
illicit drug use and providing clean urine samples A missed test will
be recorded as a contaminated sample Period minimum of
months Case
Parents to engage in urinalysis testing up to times per week and
remain clean for months Case
Drug and alcohol free for months required urine analysis and
random hair analysis Case
Parents were also commonly required to complete residential reha
bilitation or drug and alcohol outreach programs The requirements
were fairly consistent across the cases although there was some variation
on the detail of the requirement outlined For instance the first example
below relied on professional advice on whether the parent had met re
quirements and made sufficient progress however the third example
also required a drug relapse prevention plan
Mother to remain drug free by completing residential rehabilitation
or outreach program Goal abstain from illicit drug use Period for
length of program or on professional advisement that all re
quirements completed and sufficient progress made Case
Attend drug rehabilitation facility or engage in outreach drug and
alcohol counselling Department can provide service information but
parents to initiate contact and ensure attendance Parents to under
stand reasons for drug use develop alternative coping strategies and
understand impact of drug use on parenting ability capacity Case
Mother to demonstrate that she can apply what she has learned
about DV drug use and anger management over a period of no less
than months To abstain from speed methamphetamines and
amphetamines reduce marijuana use and undertake urinalysis
when requested Mo to also have a clear drug relapse prevention plan
outlining what she will do when she feels like using who she will get
help from and what they will do Case
There was also variation in the amount of support offered by the
Department across cases in relation to drug and alcohol requirements
Some cases the Department offered to provide the referral to drug and
alcohol services whereas others were required to contact the services
and or admit themselves
Task attend and complete residential rehab program Mother ex
pected to contact centre and admit herself Case
There was also variation in the level of financial support for parents
to be able to attend counselling with some getting some financial
assistance and other parents required to be financially responsible for
counselling Some examples include
Children and Youth Services Review
Counselling engage in counselling sessions sessions with a
psychologist covered by Medicare and Dept will cover cost of gap
Case
Mother to enter a detox and rehabilitation program and complete
weeks of program to graduate Mother to attend and be financially
responsible for regular counselling regarding her drug dependency
Case
Mental health
Over half the cases had mental health related requirements
The most prevalent of these was that parents were required to get a
mental health assessment and counselling Common examples of this
requirement included
Mental health assessment counselling Task Undertake psycho
logical assessment to determine if there are mental health issues that
may impact on parenting capacity and anger management and
attend counselling service Goal address any mental health and
anger management concerns e g obtain a mental health plan from a
GP for referral to psychologist a number of sessions will be covered
by Medicare Parent expected to contact services and book own
appointments Period number of sessions determined by counsel
lors Case
Counselling engage in counselling sessions sessions with a
psychologist covered by Medicare and Dept will cover cost of gap
Dept would like mother to address issues of past trauma identify
triggers which can cause stress and poor mental health learn
appropriate coping strategies and how to avoid negative coping
strategies e g alcohol use Dept will require a progress report from
counsellor Case
There were a small number in addition to a mental health
assessment where there were requirements to have an assessment for
intellectual capacity and how it may impact on the ability to adequately
parent
Department needs to see that mother s mental health and intellec
tual capacity are sufficient to provide for the safe parenting of infant
Counselling and mental health Mother will attend appointments
arranged for her mental health and cognitive functioning to be
assessed Mother will continue to attend counselling until the rele
vant service provider confirms that she is able to self manage her
mental health Reunification timetable to transition infant home
Dept will consider reunification of infant to care of Mother once
following occurs Receipt of a mental health and cognitive func
tioning assessment stating that Mother is capable of providing infant
with his daily needs and is willing and able to keep infant safe Case
Undertake assessment of cognitive functioning Undertake psycho
logical assessment with a Department psychologist to assess
parenting capacity including capacity to learn modify behaviours
and sustain behavioural change Follow through with recommen
dations from the psychological assessment regarding any further
supports in line with reunification goals Case
Some mother s were required to attend specialist mental health
clinics or assessments which were exemplified by the cases below

Parenting skills and capacity
There were a large proportion of cases where mothers and
fathers were required to address parenting issues in their safety plans In
some cases this involved undertaking parenting courses which
primarily included the requirement
Parenting Task attend age appropriate parenting courses such as
Circle of Security Goal obtain positive reports from facilitators and
contact supervisors regarding participation and understanding and
meeting children s needs Period ongoing Case
A large proportion of parents were asked to complete a
parenting capacity assessment which had varied wording regarding
what was to be assessed Some examples include
Mother to participate in parenting capacity assessment by Depart
mental psychologist or other professional to provide an opinion re
attachment between mother and child mother s insight into child s

ensure that they get immediate medical attention when required
Parents need to demonstrate that at all times that they can consis
tently provide care that will address all of child s medical needs such
as attending all necessary appointments physiotherapy ophthal
mology and OT as well as providing care at home that ensures that he
does not regress developmentally Case
In many safety plans there were requirements about contact visits
and some outlined specific behavioural expectations
Contact with children remains positive by focusing on children s
needs and attending contact or rearrange that they can t contact

Case
A number of parents were also asked to complete in home parenting
support programs or reunification programs

how needs will be met establishing a routine keeping house clean
discipline strategies health eating and food prep Mother will
maintain and demonstrate her learning for a period of months
before reunification can occur Mo needs to support children in going
to school every day Case
A number of safety plans outlined the progression of contact based
on meeting specific conditions and favourable reports In some cases
this included parallel planning if the parents were unable to meet these
conditions and requirements An example Case is outlined below
Progression of contact Stage Where contact has been assessed as
positive and in the best interests of the children it will progress to
ward increased supervised periods within a period of not less than
months once parent s demonstrate their ability to attend every
contact on time provide clean urinalysis participate in counselling
for drug use DV and commence a psychological and parenting
capacity assessment
Stage Once parent s successfully meet these conditions and con
tact has been assessed as positive and in the children s best interests
then unsupervised contact will be offered providing for parent s to
leave the venue where contact will be held with children
Stage On successful completion of Stage unsupervised contact
will progress toward home visits during which time a referral will be
made to a reunification programme
Stage On successful completion of stage a transition toward full
reunification will commence
Parallel planning In the event that parent s have not been able to
commence addressing the requirements for reunification within a
month period the Department will develop a parallel plan for the
children s long term care and may seek to revoke the time limited
orders and replace them with until orders so that the children can
be placed permanently
Co occurring family issues service referrals
On average families had three family issues or service referrals to
address the departments concerns Of the cases had three family
issues service referrals with of families having four The majority
of families were asked to address drug and alcohol concerns or attend
drug and alcohol services rehabilitation followed by parenting
services parenting capacity assessments mental health services
and domestic violence services
Discussion
This research provides important evidence from a court file review of
families going through care proceedings for their infants who were
removed into out of home care due to child protection concerns in the
child s first year of life Of the court files analysed of the
families were reported to child protection prenatally and were
reported postnatally Half of the cases involved infants who were
Aboriginal One in five infants were removed directly from the
maternity ward with infants removed into care on average at
M O Donnell et al
months The majority of the infants had siblings with a large
proportion having an elder sibling in care
The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence
drug and alcohol use and mental health issues The
majority of these cases resulted in final orders with a large proportion
having until protection orders and having the orders
revoked or withdrawn with the infant restored to the family For infants
that were reunified the average time to reunification was months
Half of the infants were placed in foster care half were placed in kinship
care and a large proportion of extended family were assessed for care
and found suitable although some did not have the capacity for a full
time care role
While in all cases the Department had legal representation of
mothers had legal representation at final orders and to a lesser extent
fathers The challenge in undertaking the case file reviews was
that the majority of the information contained in the file was evidence
filed on behalf of the Department with only of cases having a
parent affidavit on file This is in contrast to the case file review con
ducted in New South Wales where the majority of cases had parent af
fidavits presented to the court as evidence Taplin et al under review
The majority of cases had information from the Department
regarding safety plans which articulated the requirements of parents for
their infant to be reunified to their care To our knowledge there are no
previous studies that have examined the safety plans in case files to
determine parental requirements There was also no information on the
files of how the safety goals and requirements were decided upon or
whether they were developed in collaboration with parents or advo
cates support workers A greater understanding of this process would be
useful in research going forward In many of the files the requirements
were worded very similarly indicating that they are commonly used
requirements across the Department
There were a large proportion of cases where parents were required
to actively engage with the Department with some articulating specific
behavioural requirements including responding to calls attending
meetings and being respectful Engagement has been described as a
process of establishing effective working relationships so that there can
be a shared understanding of goals and a shared commitment

engagement of birth parents in the child protection system many factors
can impact on parent s ability to engage including the impact on families
of multiple and complex needs previous involvement with child pro
tection including parents being a child in care history of stolen gen
eration and government mistrust cultural differences and risk or deficit
based approaches to families by workers
