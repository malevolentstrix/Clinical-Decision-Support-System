ABSTRACT
Introduction Medicaid family planning waivers can increase access to health care services and have been associated
with lower rates of unintended pregnancy which are associated with a higher risk of negative birth outcomes such as
preterm birth and low birthweight The objective of this study was to test the effect of Georgia s Medicaid family
planning waiver Planning for Healthy Babies on pregnancy characteristics and birth outcomes
Materials and Methods We used the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System PRAMS survey data in pre
and two post periods We identified those likely eligible for in Georgia n and
comparison states n and tested for effects using state and year fixed effects difference in differences modeling
Results was associated with a percentage point pp decrease in unintended pregnancy in the immediate
post period p and an pp decrease in the later post period p For the immediate post period
was also associated with a pp increase in the probability of prepregnancy contraception p and a pp
decrease in the probability of a very low birthweight VLBW birth p The reduction in VLBW birth was significant
for non Hispanic Black mothers pp p but not for mothers of other races ethnicities
Discussion Medicaid family planning waivers are an important structural policy intervention that can improve repro
ductive health care particularly in states without Medicaid expansion These waivers may also help address long
standing racial ethnic disparities in access to reproductive health care and potentially adverse pregnancy and birth
outcomes However the initial increase in pregnancies among people using contraception indicates that care must be
taken to ensure that recipients have access to effective methods of contraception and receive counseling on effective use
in order to avoid unintended consequences as more individuals try to prevent a pregnancy

insurance covering Ranji et al Medicaid also funds
most U S publicly funded family planning services accounting
for roughly of the billion in public family planning ex

Prior Literature Examining Impacts of Medicaid Family Planning
Waivers
Studies of Medicaid family planning waivers indicate that
they have led to improvements in family planning
Bronstein
et al Kearney Levine and contraceptive service
use
Adams et al Dunlop et al Five studies
examined the effect of Medicaid family planning expansions on
pregnancies and births Adams et al examined pregnancy rates
following two state specific waiver implementations noting a
percentage point pp decline in current pregnancies among
nulliparous those who have never given birth in California
Adams et al and a pp decline in unintended preg
nancies ending in live birth in Oregon Adams et al Foster
et al
estimated that nearly unintended preg
nancies were averted by California s waiver and both
Lindrooth and McCullough
and
Kearney and Levine
estimated that states implementing Medicaid family
planning expansions experienced reductions in overall births to
adults Kearney Levine Lindrooth McCullough
Kearney and Levine
reported a reduction in births
among nonteens when results were scaled up to reflect those
newly eligible for a waiver Relatedly studies report reductions in
public spending for unplanned pregnancies and births
Amaral
et al Kearney Levine and increases in preven
tive health service use e g routine checkups cervical cancer
screening STI testing Adams et al Dunlop et al
Wherry following waiver implementation
In addition Medicaid family planning expansions are an
example of structural policy interventions that may promote
more equitable access to coverage for family planning and
related services which is particularly important given the
prevalent racial and ethnic disparities in uninsurance Artiga
et al
and reproductive health care access and outcomes
Dehlend orf et al Sutton et al Thompson et al
To our knowledge only two analyses have examined the
effects of Medicaid family planning waivers on racial and ethnic
disparities finding that waivers are associated with greater re
ductions in very low birthweight VLBW births among Black vs
white teens Bryant et al and racial and ethnic disparities
in the use of highly effective methods of contraception
Dehlendorf et al However important gaps in the liter
ature remain Although some studies have examined the effect of
Medicaid family planning waivers on pregnancy and birth out
comes few have examined pregnancy characteristics i e preg
nancy intention and pregnancy prevention efforts and birth
outcomes such as low birthweight LBW and VLBW births
Bryant et al Dehlendorf et al
Georgia s Medicaid Family Planning Waiver
Georgia s Planning for Healthy Babies Program is
Georgia s Section a Medicaid family planning demonstra
tion waiver Implemented in January expanded
eligibility for family planning and family planning related ser
vices to uninsured Georgia residents aged years who are
able to become pregnant and have family incomes at or below
of the federal poverty level FPL FPL as of April
but are otherwise ineligible for Georgia s Medicaid or Children s
Health Insurance Program CHIP covers family planning
and family planning related services and supplies including all
methods of contraception approved by the U S Food and Drug
Administration STI testing and treatment Pap smears pelvic
exams colposcopies contraceptive management education
and counseling and other services routinely provided in a family
planning setting Georgia s waiver is unique in that it explicitly
includes the goals of reducing LBW and VLBW birth rates along
with the number of unintended pregnancies and Medicaid costs
These goals were reinforced with a unique component that
provides Medicaid coverage of selected services postpartum for
individuals giving birth to a VLBW infant Analyzing effects of
Georgia s waiver provides insight on access to reproductive
health care in a state that has not expanded Medicaid and one
that has among the poorest and most disparate maternal out
comes in the nation We use a quasi experimental design and
data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
PRAMS to examine the effects of on pregnancy charac
teristics and birth outcomes among individuals in Georgia
compared with similar individuals in comparison states We also
examine racial and ethnic differences in these effects

Materials and Methods
Data Source and Study Sample
The PRAMS is a mixed mode population based state specific
surveillance system of selected maternal behaviors and experi
ences before and during pregnancy and months following
birth of a liveborn infant administered in partnership between
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and state
health departments Shulman et al PRAMS data comprise
pregnancies ending in live birth and currently cover approxi
mately of all U S births Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention Individuals with a live birth are sampled
using state birth certificate files to ensure representativeness of
live births in the state PRAMS oversamples subpopulations of
particular public health interest and these are stratified using
various stratification variables including maternal age race
ethnicity infant birth weight and geographic area
Shulman
To ensure high quality data the CDC uses a
et al
response rate threshold for making PRAMS data publicly avail
able
Shulman et al ranging from to during our
study period Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
We made no restriction to the sample based on multi
ple gestation or other criteria
Our study sample included data before the imple
mentation of and two post periods both
before and after Affordable Care Act
ACA implementation We excluded data from the year of
implementation as most pregnancies births in this year
began before implementation PRAMS data from Georgia for
were not publicly available as the required response
rate threshold was not met Using PRAMS data it is not possible
to identify enrollees directly Our study population con
sisted of PRAMS respondents who were uninsured prepregnancy
and had a Medicaid paid birth These individuals likely met the
income criteria did not qualify for Medicaid as a low
income parent but did qualify when pregnant and met the key
criteria of being uninsured Using the PRAMS data and
these criteria we identified comparison groups consistently
across states and over time
We identified comparison states as those with PRAMS data
available during the study period no Medicaid family plan
ning waiver first implemented during the study period and no
change to an existing Medicaid family planning waiver during
the study period Comparison states were Alaska Colorado
Delaware Hawaii Massachusetts Nebraska Ohio Tennessee
Utah and West Virginia We used all listed states as comparison
states in the immediate post period and non
Medicaid expansion states Nebraska Tennessee and Utah as
the relevant comparison states in the later post period
A key criterion in selecting our comparison states was a
formal test of equality in trends of outcome measures in Georgia
and the comparison states We adopted the event study
approach to investigate how trends in outcomes between groups
evolved before and after implementation This approach
allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption is
reasonable in the difference in difference models We found
limited evidence of a systematic difference in the pre policy
trends between the comparison states and Georgia over the
short pre period for which we have data Appendix Figures
In addition to examining pre trends the event study model
allowed us to examine how effects change over each post
implementation period and years We conducted
two sensitivity analyses using a subset of comparison states
states that did not expand Medicaid during our full study period
Nebraska Tennessee and Utah and states with data avail
able for each year included in the analysis Alaska Colorado
Massachusetts and Utah
Outcome Variables
We examined two outcomes related to pregnancy charac
teristics unintended pregnancy ending in live birth and
pregnancy prevention efforts We also examined two birth out
comes LBW grams and VLBW grams
births
Unintended Pregnancy Ending in Live Birth
We assessed unintended pregnancy ending in live birth using
constructed dichotomous measures that account for changes in
PRAMS questionnaires over time For all years PRAMS re
spondents are asked Thinking back to just before you got preg
nant with your new baby how did you feel about becoming
pregnant We classified births as unintended if the response
included wanted to be pregnant later or didn t want to be
pregnant then or at any time in the future Births were considered
intended if the response included wanted to be pregnant
sooner or wanted to be pregnant then Starting in an
additional response choice was added I wasn t sure what I
wanted if a respondent indicated this response the birth was
classified based on the answer to a second question When you
got pregnant with your new baby were you trying to get pregnant
Births in which respondents were not sure how they felt but
were not trying to get pregnant were classified as unintended
We tested additional models using an unintended pregnancy
measure that excluded respondents who were unsure what they
wanted Finally we completed a separate analysis of whether a
respondent was trying to get pregnant based on the answer to
the following yes no question When you got pregnant with your
new baby were you trying to get pregnant
Pregnancy Prevention Efforts
We assessed respondents reports of efforts to prevent preg
nancy in both the preconception and postpartum periods
Pregnancy prevention during the preconception period was
based on the yes no response to the question When you got
pregnant with your new baby were you or your husband or partner
doing anything to keep from getting pregnant This question lists
common things people use to keep from getting pregnant
including birth control pills condoms withdrawal or natural
family planning Pregnancy prevention postpartum was based on
the yes no response to the question Are you and your husband
or partner doing anything now to keep from getting pregnant
Birth Weight
We defined births as LBW if grams and VLBW if
grams

Descriptive Analysis
We examined differences in maternal characteristics among
the study population in Georgia and the comparison states
during the study period using univariate and bivariate analyses
Differences across the two groups were examined using tests
and or t tests as appropriate We examined intrastate differ
ences in outcomes preimplementation compared with the im
mediate post period and a later post period
using regression analysis
Multivariable Analysis
We investigated the relationship between and preg
nancy prevention and birth outcomes using two way i e state
and year fixed effects FE modeling We estimated the
following multivariable logistic regression models

displays sample sizes and maternal characteristics
among PRAMS respondents in Georgia and the comparison
states The two samples were comparable with regard to age
distribution with more than two thirds of respondents aged
years in both samples There were significant differences in
the racial ethnic distribution of the samples with Georgia
exhibiting more racial diversity In Georgia of the sample
identified as non Hispanic Black compared with in the
comparison group whereas slightly fewer identified as
Hispanic compared with in the comparison group
Compared with individuals in comparison states individuals
giving birth in Georgia were significantly less likely to have some
college be married or report smoking or drinking before preg
nancy but more likely to have had prior births Finally in
dividuals in Georgia reported significantly fewer experiences of
stressful events during the months before birth Maternal
characteristics among PRAMS respondents in Georgia and in
each group of comparison states stratified by imple
mentation are presented in Appendix Tables and
The descriptive data presented in Table examine changes in
the study outcomes stratified by sample Georgia vs comparison
states from the preimplementation period to the immediate
post period and the later post period overall and by race
ethnicity The results indicate a reduction in the first measure of
unintended pregnancy for both groups in the later post period
Among Georgia PRAMS respondents there was a pp
reduction in the second measure of unintended pregnancy in the
immediate post period and a pp reduction in the later post
period whereas a significant reduction in the comparison states
was only observed in the later post period Regarding precon
ception pregnancy prevention there was a large increase
pp in the percentage of respondents reporting preconception
pregnancy prevention efforts in Georgia in the immediate post
period and no significant increase among those in
comparison states
Neither sample showed an increase in the use of pregnancy
prevention postpartum in the immediate post period but post
partum prevention declined significantly for both groups in the
later post period There was not a significant change in LBW
births among the sample in Georgia or the comparison states
whereas there was a significant decline in VLBW births from
to among the sample in Georgia from the pre period to
the later post period With regard to differences by race
ethnicity the percentages of non Hispanic Black respondents in
both Georgia and comparison states with unintended pregnan
Cies in the pre period were approximately higher than
those for non Hispanic white respondents Rates of VLBW
although lower in comparison states were more than twice as
high for non Hispanic Black individuals compared with non
Hispanic white individuals in all states in the pre period
Multivariable Analyses
Based on the difference in differences analysis in
Table
there was a significant decrease in the probability that a preg
nancy in Georgia was unintended in the immediate post period
relative to the pre period with a pp decrease p based
on the second measure The effect in the immediate post period
held only for non Hispanic white individuals for whom there
was a p to pp p reduction in the prob
ability that a pregnancy was unintended in the immediate post
period
There is some evidence that the reduction in unintended
pregnancy remained in the later post period Across the two
measures there was an p to pp decrease
p in the probability that a pregnancy was unintended
among all respondents in the later post period This later period
effect held only for non Hispanic Black respondents Among
non Hispanic Black respondents implementation was
associated with a p to pp decrease p in
the probability that a pregnancy was unintended in the later
post period We did not find significant effects on the measures
of unintended pregnancy among Hispanic respondents in either
period Among all respondents implementation was not

did not expand Medicaid during the study period and sensitivity
analyses using comparison states with data available during the

Discussion
Findings from this study suggest that Georgia s Medicaid
family planning waiver was associated with reduction in
the rate of unintended pregnancy ending in live births and an
increase in preconception pregnancy prevention Stratified ana
lyses suggest that the positive impacts of on birth out
comes occurred among non Hispanic Black mothers who
disproportionately experience adverse pregnancy outcomes
Increased prepregnancy prevention and reductions in VLBW and
LBW infants were found among non Hispanic Black mothers in
the immediate post period
Although the effects found here align closely with the goals of
the inconsistent finding of both increased pregnancy
prevention preconception and increased unintended births is
suggestive of an increase in less effective contraceptive methods
or ineffective use with This is important to consider given
that failure rates of oral contraception have been found to be

Our
results indicate that the effect of on pregnancy prevention
preconception held for non Hispanic Black individuals but the
inconsistent finding noted previously held only for non Hispanic
white individuals and only in the immediate post period This
may indicate that non Hispanic Black individuals in Georgia
found increased access to family planning and potentially to
effective methods with the implementation of It may also
indicate differences in how non Hispanic white individuals
respond to a question about intendedness post childbirth and or
when their intention was to give birth but to do so later Previous

found that Black mothers had higher relative risks of reporting
an unwanted birth rather than an intended or mistimed birth
compared with white mothers Guzman et al

expansions and reductions in unintended pregnancies ending in
live births Adams et al Foster et al It is difficult to
compare our findings with the study of Foster et al as it
used a Markov chain to predict the number of live births pre
vented however the PRAMS based study reported a similar
reduction of pp in unintended pregnancies ending in live
birth in Oregon Adams et al Additional studies examined
the effect of Medicaid family planning expansions on birth rates
directly
Kearney Levine Lindrooth McCullough
Kearney and Levine estimated a reduction in
live births among adults newly eligible for a family planning
waiver The current study adds to the literature by examining
both preconception contraception use and unintended preg
nancies ending in live birth The differential findings by race
ethnicity provide new insights that need further research and
review Analysis of the later post period adds important
information on potential longer term effects of a Medicaid family
planning waiver in states that have not expanded Medicaid
Addressing existing racial ethnic disparities in maternal and
infant outcomes continues to be critical and PRAMS data high
light the disparities in LBW and VLBW births between non
Hispanic Black and white mothers in Georgia and comparison
states As U S rates of maternal morbidity and mortality exceed
those of other industrialized nations and differences by maternal
race ethnicity persist the need for structural changes to the U S
health care system grows increasingly apparent Crear Perry
et al
Our finding that the associations of
with reduced unintended pregnancy and poor birth outcomes
were concentrated among non Hispanic Black mothers in
Georgia suggests the program may have lessened these racial
disparities
However it is important to note that simply expanding
eligibility for Medicaid family planning services does not guar
antee equitable access to services and correspondingly improved
health outcomes indeed the measures used in this analysis do
not assess reproductive autonomy instead simply measuring
reproductive health service use and outcomes Recent qualitative
work examining structural racism that Black women in the South
experience when accessing sexual and reproductive health ser
vices highlights important limitations of Medicaid family
planning coverage Thompson et al Thompson et al
conducted focus groups and in depth interviews with
Black women living in Georgia and North Carolina and found
that even with Medicaid coverage respondents reported dis
rupted reproductive health care use and insurmountable finan
Cial barriers to receiving services These findings highlight the
importance of understanding that even though efforts to expand
access are encouraging structural overhauls within state
Medicaid programs are needed to ensure that beneficiaries have
access to timely high quality reproductive health care
Even as states have expanded Medicaid policymakers should
recognize and address the gaps in coverage that remain for in
dividuals with incomes higher than FPL who may become
Medicaid eligible based on pregnancy Without family planning
waivers or other policies providing preconception and post
partum coverage individuals falling into coverage gaps typically
lack access to high quality family planning and other health care
services critical to their reproductive care Expanding access to
non Medicaid subsidized insurance such as the Marketplace to
uninsured individuals of reproductive age has the potential to
reduce insurance churning pre and postpregnancy and
Medicaid paid births while improving birth outcomes such as
breastfeeding
We note that Georgia like many
Palmer
other states is implementing a permanent I year postpartum
Medicaid coverage option made available to states by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act of
Limitations
This study is subject to limitations First we measure unin
tended pregnancies ending in live births and hence cannot
measure effects on all unintended pregnancies Second although
the PRAMS data have been successfully used to evaluate family
planning waivers using a treatment group as defined here leaves
room for misclassification For example individuals who would
have been eligible for Medicaid as low income parents but who
did not enroll prepregnancy will be included in the treatment
group as will teens who are otherwise eligible for CHIP
Compared with the target population of uninsured in
dividuals otherwise ineligible for Medicaid they are younger
have lower incomes and may more likely be citizens than those
enrolling only at delivery These factors may increase their
probability of unintended pregnancy and hence bias our
measured effect downward Third we do not observe the preg
nancy outcomes among those actually enrolling in Given
the intent to treat nature of this study the effect we estimate is
by definition lower than the effect of those treated The PRAMS
treatment group in may have characteristics different
from those who enrolled in if those in more need of
coverage for family planning and related services actually
enrolled substantiating a lower bound effect measured here We
note that the PRAMS data are limited in that we cannot examine
outcomes among groups such as Asian Americans Pacific Is
landers American Indians Alaska Natives or those with multi
racial identities We also cannot speak to the specific types of
prepregnancy contraceptive methods used the PRAMS question
lists common methods people use including both more and less
effective methods Finally we were unable to account for the
small number of clusters in our multivariable models with ap
proaches such as wild cluster bootstrapping when using complex
survey data commands needed for PRAMS this may affect our
standard errors and hence affect significance

ABSTRACT
Introduction Recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasize the importance of access
to comprehensive family planning services and recommend patient centered contraceptive counseling be incorporated
into routine primary care visits for reproductive age individuals This study aims to describe family planning service
provision in outpatient care settings and assess differences by facility and clinician characteristics
Methods Using National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data a nationally representative survey of outpatient care
visits we assessed family planning service provision by facility location facility type physician specialty types of cli
nicians seen and whether the patient was seen by their primary care provider We used random intercept logistic
regression with robust standard errors adjusting for patient characteristics and state and year fixed effects
Results The analytic sample included patient visits with reproductive age years individuals between
and Family planning services were provided at of total sampled visits and were more likely to be provided
in urban compared with rural areas adjusted odds ratio p and at community health centers compared with
private physician practices adjusted odds ratio p Family planning services were also more likely to be
provided when the patient saw a physician assistant or nurse compared with only a physician After controlling for
observed covariates measures of between clinician heterogeneity indicate wide variation in which clinicians provided
family planning services
Conclusions Family planning services were more likely to be provided in urban areas at community health centers and
when patients received team based care The wide variation between clinicians suggests a need to better incorporate
family planning services into primary care and other outpatient settings to meet patient needs and preferences

Despite these recommendations many clinicians do not
provide family planning services owing to challenges such as a
lack of knowledge or training limited time and support staff
misconceptions and bias which limit patient access Harper
et al Hoover Tao Berman Kent Stulberg
et al
Several studies cite lack of training as a barrier
to contraception provision especially for intrauterine devices
IUDS and contraceptive implants However researchers have
also found that even when clinicians have the relevant
training they often still do not deliver evidence based family
planning services Greenberg Makino Coles Kang
et al Shoupe Thompson Broecker Dade
Available time and support staff also impact whether
family planning services are provided and these resources are
often limited in rural areas experiencing workforce shortages
McNeil Mitchell Parker Research has found that
rural populations face increased barriers to accessing care and
have limited access to comprehensive family planning services
