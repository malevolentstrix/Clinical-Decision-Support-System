Family planning conversations are designed not only to help BRCA
previvors decide when to have kids but also whether they want kids at
all As BRCA previvors can be diagnosed quite early in life some say they
were frustrated while interacting with their care team For example one
young participant noted that she didn t like how the conversation was cen
tered around building a family versus being alive I m thinking more about
the fact that regardless of having a family if I don t do these things I m not
going to be here for my family So that s really what s more important to
me is me being here versus the family I m creating Another par
ticipant agreed saying It was extremely frustrating for me especially
as a year old with no clear plans to get married or have kids It re
ally it was almost like it felt like fearmongering now that I m out of it
Discussion and conclusion
Discussion
This study found that while genetic counselors and other providers of
fered valuable information to patients previvors felt unprepared emotion
ally to take on their diagnosis and unsure of whether they would receive
a high quality of care They believed genetic counselors and providers
gave incomplete information that left them confused and afraid of what
was to come Providers also made assumptions about previvors identity
and family planning based on perceived gender sexual orientation
and age
In response to RQI we found most previvors perceived their communi
cation with genetic counselors to be positive overall especially when
previvors took the time to advocate for themselves as a patient However
specific interactions were perceived as negative by previvors throughout
their office visit experiences Feelings of frustration and distress occurred
throughout the previvor experience as suggested in a similar study
from meeting with genetic counselors to receiving treaunent Our study
found that even those tangential to the medical intervention process such
as front desk staff at medical offices and hospitals impact the experiences
of previvors
In response to previvors said they felt pushed toward assimilating
with societal norms in appointments with genetic counselors and other pro
viders The tendency for genetic counselors to assume a patient s identity
and life goals based on their perceived gender sexual orientation and
age can be harmful for BRCA patients putting them in a position where
they may be encouraged to disclose personal and private information to
correct the assumptions of the genetic counselor BRCA patients need care
that is personalized to them to reduce the possibility of psychological
harm Currently there is a lack of research on identity
inclusive language and conversation tactics for providers to implement
when discussing treatment and family planning options with BRCA
patients A recent case study reviewed an experience treating a young
trans feminine BRCA patient Even as a child under with BRCA
the genetic counselor and healthcare providers respected the patient s au
tonomy and identity by including them in all decisions listening to their
perspective and committing to the obligation of clinicians to do no
harm This case demonstrates how ethical principles and implementing
patient centered care can be used to help guide providers and manage un
certainty for BRCA patients related to their identity and more research is
needed to craft proper guidelines around working with BRCA patients in
this capacity
Practicing patient centered care would also encourage counselors to ask
about family planning rather than making assumptions about patients pref
erences and values Recent studies have argued providers require more ef
fective education regarding specific subgroups and their needs When
genetic counselors meet with a feminine presenting patient they may as
sume pronouns sexual orientation and the desire of their patient to have
PEC Innovation
children Pre screening BRCA patients with surveys about pronouns
and identity and communicating with the patient in an initial meeting
about their life plans might mitigate assumptions For younger BRCA pa
tients meeting with genetic counselors psychosocial needs are an impor
tant focus when meeting with genetic counselors and family planning In
a previous study young BRCA patients noted psychosocial distress as a fac
tor of family planning much more frequently than was recognized by ge
netic counselors and as BRCA patients receive diagnoses earlier in
life providers must consider how their age may impact their treatment
and family planning decisions Finally patient centered care not only per
tains to the specific provider a patient is seeing but must be threaded
through a patient s entire experience with the healthcare system Under
standing that each BRCA previvor is an individual with specific needs for
personalized care will only serve to support that patient in their previvor
journey
While strengths of this study include giving voice to BRCA previvors
and their experiences there were some limitations First the interviews
were conducted over Zoom due to COVID limitations and geographical
distance between the researchers and participants limiting the
interviewer s ability to fully connect with the participant Video interviews
limit the interviewer s ability to respond to body language and utilize the
participant s physical response to questioning as a guide for future ques
tions Additionally the differences in geographic location of each partici
pant may be a limitation considering the access to healthcare varies
widely across the United States Second participants were recruited
through Instagram and TikTok keeping in line with the larger study objec
tives The algorithm present on both platforms most likely pushed the most
popular BRCA previvor accounts to the surface leaving out valuable partic
ipants with smaller follower counts This also meant most participants were
white or white passing This mirrors similar studies which found very little
social media content created by and for Black previvors and other previvors
of color We recognize the limitations of this study as the inclusion
criteria was specific to the larger project and thus overlooked previvors ex
periences with healthcare providers who do not share about their journey
on social media Future studies should explore these community members
perceptions of communication with genetic counselors and other
healthcare providers
Innovation
This study offers an innovative lens through which scholars and
healthcare providers may examine the experiences of BRCA previvors as
they seek adequate care By examining the communicative process of seek
ing BRCA care rather than the health outcomes of the care itself we provide
an innovative approach to investigate previvors perceptions of communi
cation with genetic counselors and other members of their healthcare
team This study increases knowledge around the communication processes
of previvors and gives them agency by allowing them to openly share their
personal experiences Specifically our findings suggest biases among pro
viders related to gender age and sexual orientation are concerning ele
ments of family planning communication that potentially interrupt
previvors abilities to express their care needs in a safe environment We
argue for an increased awareness of and advocacy for more inclusive con
versations regarding treatment and family planning decisions This study
also informs the actors we ve noted throughout the study including genetic
counselors other healthcare providers and policymakers Scholars should
continue to conduct studies that explore the relationship between BRCA
previvors and providers to ensure previvors are receiving inclusive commu
nication surrounding family planning and treatrnent options
Conclusion
This article provides an innovative look at BRCA previvors perceptions
of communication with genetic counselors and other healthcare providers
Interviews with previvors suggest genetic counselors and healthcare team
members often make assumptions about previvors family planning and
M L Wellman et al
treatment based on perceived gender age and sexual orientation BRCA
patients require individualized attention when planning for their future
and making decisions about their healthcare and implementing patient
centered care practices into the communication process can provide a
higher quality of care Future research should continue to give agency to
BRCA previvors especially those from marginalized groups to reduce
assumptions surrounding treatrnent options and family planning

Analyzing the Effect of Prenatal Care
on Pregnancy Outcome
A Conditional Approach
Michael H Malloy MD MS Tzu Cheg Kao PhD and Y J Lee PhD
ABSTRACT
Am Health
InfrMuction
Vital statistics data is a readily avail
able source of information on prenatal
care usage in the United States How to
examine vital statistics and other types of
data for the effect of prenatal care on preg
nan outcome has generated a number of
different methodologies One of the dif
ficulties encountered in using such data
has been the problem of overcoming the
preterm bias effect The preterm bias ef
fect is associated with observing better
outcomes in women who receive prenatal
care than in women who receive no care
This artifact occurs because women re
ceiving no care may deliver prematurely
and may not have an opportunity to enroll
in prenatal care By conditioning the ef
fect of the age of entry into prenatal care
on the gestational age of delivery how
ever the preterm bias effect can be
avoided Nonetheless other problems en
countered in vital statistics data may in
validate the results of the conditional ap
proach
In this study we demonstrate the ef
fect that the possible misclassification of
gestational age in vital statistics data has
on the interpretation of the conditional ap
proach and discuss the problematic nature
of the evaluation of prenatal care
The data for this analysis were ob
tained from linked birth and death certif
icates from Missouri for through
The variables used in the analysis
were the gestational age at which prenatal
care was initiated self report and limited
to the first weeks of pregnancy the
gestational age at delivery based on last

tiple vs single parity maternal age and
maternal education We used only those
records that involved gestational ages of
greater than weeks and less than
weeks Of the records available
were used for the unad
justed analyses and were
used for the adjusted analyses
The association of the gestational age
of entry into prenatal care with pregnancy
outcome was examined relative to the ges
tational age of delivery Outcomes still
births or infant deaths are presented as
death rates percentage dead We calcu
lated odds ratios for stillbirths or infant
deaths by logistic regression models

with parity through maternal age less

linear trends were carried out for mortality
rates over the gestational ages of entry
into prenatal care Furthermore we
adjusted our results by declaring new
borns that exceeded the percentile
birth weight standards for gestational age
reported by as misclassified
All computations were carried out using

By conditional analysis the risk per
centage of mortality of stillbirth or infant

When the time of entry into pre

the association of prenatal care with preg

ample it appears that in women who de
livered at less than weeks and who
entered prenatal care in the first trimester
there were more adverse pregnancy out
comes than in those women who delivered
at this ne and were not in prenatal care
We believe this is an artifact Kramer et al
have reported a systematic underestima

based solely on the last menstrual period
When infants weighing over the per
centile for their gestational age were elim

natal care for these women is responsible
for the better outcome of the early en
trants cannot be determined Early entry
may reflect as much on the healthy behav
ioral characteristics of these women as it
does on any effect of prenatal care
The evaluation of prenatal care is a
complex problem The incorrect assign
ment of gestational age affects signifi
cantly the results of any perinatal analysis
and continues to be a major problem for
which no solution is readily available As
a result there is no ideal model available
to assess the association between prenatal
care and pregnancy outcome Because of
the substantial problems associated with
observational data the use of randomized
trials of different modes of care deserves

The safety of Home Birth The Farm
Study
A Mark Durand MI MPH
Despite a sizable body of literature on
the subject the authors of two recent re
views have concluded that a final judg
ment regarding the relative safety of home
birth still cannot be made
This study compares the outcomes of
a cohort of planned lay midwife
attended home births from the Farm mid
wifery service in rural Tennessee with the
outcomes of a sample of physician at
tended hospital births derived from the
US National Natality Fetal
Mortality Survey NNS NFMS This is
the largest comparative study of a cohort
of home births yet published
Previous studies of home birth safety
underscore the importance of having ex
plicit comparison groups rather than of
being strictly of considering
planned and unplanned home births
separately of tracking intrapartum hos
pital transfers of intended home births
and attributing the outcome to the home
birth group and of controlling for the
effects of birth weight type of delivery
attendant and demogaphic characteris
tics of the mother All these issues have
been addressed in this study
Standards of prenatal care at the
Farm are modeled to the recommenda
tions of the Arnerican College of Obste
tricians and Gynecologists Deliveries are
conducted without analgesia however
and great emphasis is placed on meeting
the emotional needs of the family Several
family members and friends are com
monly in attendance and are encouraged
to take an active role in the birth In
addition the laboring woman is encour
aged to stay off her back and remain phys
ically mobile through labor and delivery
In the absence of signs of fetal distress
women are permitted to labor beyond
hours occasionally for to days They
are also encouraged to eat and drink dur
ing labor in the belief that this allays ma
ternal and the need for opera
tive delivery

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Lead mercury cadmium and arsenic are some of the most common toxic metals to which
Canadians are exposed The effect of exposure to current low levels of toxic metals on fetal growth
restriction is unknown
Objective The aim of this study was to examine relationships between exposure to lead mercury
cadmium and arsenic during pregnancy and risk of small for gestational age SGA birth
Methods Lead mercury cadmium and arsenic levels were measured in blood samples from the first
and third trimesters in pregnant women from across Canada Arsenic species in first trimester urine
were also assessed Relative risks and confidence intervals were estimated using log binomial
multivariate regression Important covariates including maternal age parity pre pregnancy BMI and
smoking were considered in the analysis An exploratory analysis was performed to examine potential
effect modification of these relationships by single nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in GSTPI and
GSTOI genes
Results No association was found between blood lead cadmium or arsenic and risk for SGA We ob
served an increased risk for SGA for the highest compared to the lowest tertile of exposure for mercury
gg L RR CI and arsenobetaine gg L RR CI
after adjustment for the effects of parity and smoking A statistically significant interaction was observed
in the relationship between dimethylarsinic acid DMA levels in urinary arsenic and SGA between strata
of GSTOI p for interaction A marginally significant interaction was observed in the re
lationship between blood lead and SGA between strata of GSTPI p for interaction O
Conclusions These results suggest a small increase in risk for SGA in infants born to women exposed to
mercury and arsenic Given the conflicting evidence in the literature this warrants further investigation
in other pregnant populations

impact of these changes on metabolism and excretion of these

Children who are born SGA are more likely to have birth compli

Clayton et al Metals are potential risk factors for SGA
births and are hypothesized to induce growth restriction through
oxidative stress mediated pathways Myatt Specifically
when toxic metals are present in the maternal bloodstream they
may cause abnormal placental function and impair nutrient
transport to the fetus through the indirect formation of reactive
oxygen species ROS and reactive nitrogen species RNS that
cause oxidative stress by reacting with macromolecules and da
maging them When the vascular endothelium is damaged en
dothelins are released causing the smooth muscle around the
blood vessels to contract This vasoconstriction causes maternal
blood pressure to increase and decreases the blood flow to the
fetus Pollock and Pollock This reduced blood flow may
cause ischemic damage which could lead to fetal growth restric
tion and subsequent low birthweight Llanos and Ronco

generally accepted as the most reliable indicator of recent arsenic
exposure given that arsenic absorbed from the lungs or the gas

AsBe were measured in urine samples collected during the first
trimester Samples were analyzed using inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry by the Toxicology Laboratory of the
Institut National de Publique du INSPQ The de
tection limits for this study were as follows Blood Pb gg dL
Cd gg L total Hg gg L As gg L The limit of
detection for all arsenic metabolites in urine was gg ASIL
Results below the limit of detection LOD were assigned a value of
half of the LOD As there is uncertainty about the critical trimester
of exposure for fetal growth various studies have averaged con
taminant concentrations across pregnancy e g Valvi et al
Mora et al Blood metal concentrations were based on the
average of the first and third trimester measures if both were
available If only one measure was available then that measure
was used To account for variation in urine dilution due to dis
parity in sampling temperature physical activity and fluid intake
Suwazono et al specific gravity was included as a cov
ariate in the regression model

arsenic exposure and SGA The GSTOI SNP has been shown
to affect the functional activity of the enzyme Punia et al
Double stranded DNA concentration was assessed using the
Quant it PicoGreen assay Invitrogen Briefly PicoGreen dye was
added to each well Following this the fluorescent signal of the
sample was measured and plotted against the standard DNA
concentration used to make a standard curve
Birth outcomes
As part of the MIREC study each baby s length cm and weight
g at birth were abstracted from a medical chart review Gesta
tional age weeks was derived using both the woman s last
menstrual period LMP and ultrasound dating For this analysis
LMP is the preferred method for estimating gestational age since
ultrasound methods rely on fetal size to estimate gestational age
Nardozza et al If the two methods differed by days
then gestational age was determined using ultrasound due to
concerns over recall and reliability of the LMP estimate SGA births
were identified as those weighing less than the percentile for
a reference population based on the same completed week of
gestation and infant sex Kramer et al
Covariates
This analysis considered the effects of established predictors of
SGA age parity ethnicity country of origin household income
education smoking status pre pregnancy BMI and marital status
Information on these factors was collected by questionnaire dur
ing the first trimester of pregnancy

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Fetal epigenetic programming plays a critical role in development DNA methyltransferase alpha
which is involved in de novo DNA methylation DNAm is a prime candidate gene as a mediator
between prenatal exposures and birth outcomes We evaluated the relationships between in utero arsenic As
exposure birth outcomes and DNAm
Methods In a prospective Bangladeshi birth cohort cord blood DNAm of three CPGs was measured
using bisulfite pyrosequencing Maternal toenail As concentrations at birth were measured to estimate in utero
exposure Among vaginal births N structural equation models SEMs were used to evaluate re
lationships between methylation toenail As birth weight and gestational age
Results In an adjusted SEM including birth weight and gestational age maternal toenail As levels were asso
ciated with DNAm B CI and gestational age B
weeks Cl
DNAm was associated with gestational age B
weeks Cl
and birth weight B g CI There was an indirect effect of As on gestational age
mediated through DNAm B
and there were indirect effects of
Cl
maternal toenail As levels on birth weight through pathways including gestational age B
g Cl
DNAm and gestational age B
g CI and maternal weight gain
and gestational age B g CI The total effect of a doubling in maternal toenail As
concentration is a decrease in gestational age of days CI and a decrease in birth weight of g
Cl
Conclusions plays a critical role in fetal epigenetic programming In utero arsenic exposure was as
sociated with greater methylation of CPGs in which partially mediated associations between prenatal
As exposure and birth outcomes Additional studies are needed to verify this finding
Chronic exposure to arsenic As persists in many regions of the
world In Bangladesh approximately million individuals rely on
household drinking water with As concentrations exceeding the World
Health Organization WHO guideline of gg L half of which are also
above the Bangladesh standard gg L Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics and United Nation Children s Fund Inorganic As and
As metabolites readily pass the placenta resulting in a high correlation
between As concentrations measured in maternal and cord blood with
