increased cellular stress the ICM fails to continue its
division resulting in a blighted ovum
Conclusion
Zygotic splitting is a well described event in ART yet the
complete mechanism of these events is not completely eluci
dated The hypotheses that we have so far remain unproven
due to the rarity of zygotic splitting as well as the ethicolegal
considerations of human embryo research The presence of
such incidents necessitates extensive counselling of couples

Introduction
Models of abortion care are continually evolving and expanding
Historically advocates lawyers journalists clinicians and researchers
have used a variety of terms to refer to different types of abortion In
Weitz and colleagues published an editorial laying out the need
to develop consensus on standard terms because the terminology
used to describe abortion procedures influences political legislative
and medical institutions
Ill
Standardization of abortion nomen
clature and terms used to refer to different types of abortion will in
crease uniformity and accuracy in communication about abortion care
The Society of Family Planning s recommendation is to use the terms
medication abortion and procedural abortion for common use in clinical
guidance journal articles print materials websites media advocacy
policy briefs and other communication about abortion care These
recommendations align with recommendations from several other
organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists
the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
and the
COMS Project We recognize the importance of language and its role
in providing access to care that is both equitable and that centers the
patient experience We also recognize that language is complex and
nuanced We encourage medical societies and others in sexual and
reproductive health rights and justice fields to use these terms while
also inviting discussion and continued research on the optimal ap
proach to abortion nomenclature
Recommendations
a Abortion primarily with medications including mifepristone
misoprostol and misoprostol alone should be referred to as
medication abortion regardless of the setting context gestational
duration or legal status
Conflicts of interest The authors report no conflicts The Society of Family Planning receives no direct support from pharmaceutical companies or other industries for the
development of clinical guidance
Disclaimer This publication is designed as a resource to assist clinicians in providing family planning care It should not be considered inclusive of all proper treatments or
serve as the standard of care It is not intended to substitute for the independent professional judgment of the treating clinician Variations taking into account individual
circumstances may be appropriate This publication reflects the best available evidence at the time of publication recognizing that continued research or major changes in the

Historically a variety of terms have been used to refer to medi
cation abortion medical abortion the abortion pill s
abortion with pills pharmaceutical abortion medicinal abortion no
test abortion no touch abortion medically induced and induction
termination
The term medication abortion is now widely used in the United
States which suggests ease of comprehension and adoption by the
media advocates and policy makers It is also the accepted term in
clinical practice and scientific publications However widespread
public knowledge that one can end a pregnancy with medications
remains limited In a nationally representative survey of
participants assigned female at birth were aware of medication
abortion In another study done in less than a third of
U S adults reported having heard of mifepristone
Furthermore
people who report being aware of medication abortion often erro
neously confuse it with emergency contraception
The term medication abortion is preferable because the me
chanism that medications are involved is intuitively understood
unlike medical abortion Medical may imply that the abortion is
being done for medical reasons is a medical necessity or requires a
complication of pregnancy to be completed Medical also implies
the medical infrastructure or health care system is required or in
volved However medication abortion can also safely occur outside
of the formal health care system as with self managed medication
abortion
Greater use of the term medication abortion may
facilitate and expand public knowledge that an abortion with pills
exists as an option
b Abortion primarily with instrumentation including uterine as
piration manual or electric dilation and curettage dilation and
evacuation or dilation and extraction should be referred to as
procedural abortion or abortion procedure regardless of the set
ting context pregnancy duration or legal status
The following terms have been used to refer to procedural
abortion surgical aspiration in clinic procedure instrumentation
surgery put to sleep anesthesia abortion manual electric vacuum
aspiration suction abortion and uterine scraping The term proce
dural abortion conveys that it involves a mechanical intervention
that is facilitated by a skilled clinician
This avoids creating ar
tificial distinctions based on the stage of the pregnancy e g by
trimester specific tools or resources available to the clinician or
setting The term procedural abortion may be new for patients but
greater use of this term may facilitate a more accurate under
standing of what it involves
The term procedural abortion groups multiple clinical abortion
techniques using a common term For specific documents or con
texts such as medical charts research or patient counseling spe
cifying the technique used to perform the abortion procedure may
be necessary
While there is greater variation in preferred nomenclature for this
type of abortion there is broad consensus that the terms surgical and
dilation curettage should be avoided The term procedural avoids a
false suggestion that the procedure involves incisions Surgical abor
obfuscating the training requirements for
tion is a misnomer
provision Physician assistants nurse practitioners midwives and
other clinicians who are not clearly labeled as surgeons can provide
high quality and safe procedural abortion care The use of the term
surgical has fueled a perception that abortion carries substantial risks
when it is in fact an essential and extremely safe intervention
Labeling abortion procedures as surgery may evoke for the
patient scary imagery of a sterile surgical suite with scalpels and
monitors that is inconsistent with offce based care contributes to
wider misunderstanding
and provides an erroneous rationale
that abortion care must be done in an ambulatory surgical center Most
procedural abortions are safely completed in an outpatient clinical care
Contraception
setting similar to an intrauterine device IUD insertion and do not

usually related to the type of pain relief anesthesia or analgesia of
fered to the patient rather than the abortion procedure performed The
term dilation and curettage is also a misnomer as guidelines re
commend against the practice of using a sharp curette to scrape the
uterus and it is no longer the recommended primary method used in a
procedural abortion
Continued discussion
During the development of this document we identified multiple
areas where further discussion research and consensus are needed
specific to abortion nomenclature and terminology
Qualifiers such as induced spontaneous missed medically in
dicated and elective are often used to describe abortion or in
efforts to distinguish abortion from pregnancy loss or to differ
entiate why a patient is seeking abortion
Although out
side the original scope of the document it is important to uplift
this conversation as it directly impacts the broader abortion
nomenclature paradigm On a policy level using disparate lan
guage to describe care reinforces abortion stigma enabling leg
islation that limits patients options
There seems to be
consensus that qualifiers such as medically indicated and elective
are not needed when describing abortion or pregnancy loss in
clinical guidance research publications print materials websites
media advocacy legislation and other communication with the
public However more work is needed to explore how to best use
the terms recommended in this guidance and still recognize the
patient preferred language in individual counseling
Current international classification of disease ICD and current
procedural terminology CPT codes for pregnancy loss and
abortion include descriptors such as missed and induced
which may contribute to confusion stigma and bias
Consideration should be given to using medication and procedural
to describe the management of pregnancy loss i e medication
management of pregnancy loss and procedural management of
pregnancy loss
The terms medication abortion and procedural abortion may not
translate into other languages or be used commonly in practice
outside of the United States More work is needed in order to
explore and uplift ideal terminology in languages other than
English and to build international consensus
The terms gestational duration and pregnancy duration may be
preferable to the term gestational age which personifies the fetus
Conclusion
As abortion care models expand we need to review our termi
nology and refine our language as needed These recommended
terms may continue to evolve and we invite continued discussion
and research on the topic among all stakeholders Additionally for
specific documents or contexts such as medical charts and research
further clarification detail and definitions may be needed to de
scribe the specific type of intervention and model of care When
counseling people seeking to end a pregnancy there may be a
need to use terminology that is aligned with each individual s un
derstanding and values However for common use in clinical gui
dance research publications print materials websites media
advocacy legislation and other communication with the public we
encourage those in the sexual and reproductive health rights and
justice fields to use the terms medication abortion and procedural
abortion Using uniform language will support greater shared public
knowledge of the different abortion types minimize myths and
misperceptions and ensure public discussions reflect the latest

preferred terminology Given that abortion is increasingly in public
discourse and the terminology used to describe abortion influences
political legislative and medical institutions the use of standard
terminology is as important as ever

Purpose Studies focusing on safety outcomes typically require large populations to comprehensively characterise the patient
groups exposed to the medicines under investigation However there is often less information for subpopulations such as
pregnant or breastfeeding women particularly when new medicines are considered It is important to understand what
information can be obtained from drug utilization studies DUS involvmg pregnant women in the early years postmarketing
to provide supportive information for safety studies The aims of this literature review are to identify and review DUS for
new medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding and list and summarise key information items to be reported in a DUS for
new medicines in pregnancy Methods To identify postmarketing DUS of new prescription medicines or enantiomers in
pregnancy a systematic literature review was undertaken in PubMed and Embase between January and June In
addition the complete database of the ENCePP EU PAS Register was systematically searched to June Results We
identified published DUS on new medicines in pregnancy from the ENCePP EU PAS Register and none from other sources
No studies on breastfeeding were identified The identified publications reported the medicme s use for the first to years
after marketing approval No reports assessed utilization in the first years of approval It was usual to issue interim reports
annually studies All studies concerned conditions managed in ambulatory care primary care and outpatient facilities and
included some primary care prescribing Most n only had prescribing dispensing data available at individual level for
ambulatory care outpatient prescribing was included in three of these studies Three studies held a limited amount of in hospital
prescribing data A DUS can confirm at an early stage whether there are suffcient exposed pregnancies m available data sources to
ensure a safety study is powered to detect a difference in the prevalence of adverse pregnancy or infant outcomes or if additional
data from other databases are needed A DUS may also help address methodological considerations such as selection of
comparators DUS can be performed embedded in a DUS in the general population in a cohort of women of childbearing age or
in a cohort of pregnant women Conclusion This review summarises key aspects of a DUS for new medicines in pregnancy DUS
for new medicines in pregnancy should be planned before marketing scheduled for the first to years after release with annual
interim progress reports and reported in peer reviewed journals By offering detailed information on data sources exposure
timing prevalence and location coprescribing comorbidities coexposures and demographics a DUS will offer a firm foundation
for safety studies and will help to contextuahze spontaneous reporting of serious adverse events
Introduction
Humans are exposed to new medicines for the first time in
the context of preapproval clinical trials However some
of the clinical trials exclude pregnant and breastfeeding
women due to ethical legal and safety concerns of repro
ductive toxicity of the new medicine Therefore informa
tion regarding the use of new medicines during pregnancy
and breastfeeding is often listed as missing in the summary
of product characteristics and a postapproval plan is needed
to evaluate the safety of the newly approved product
During drug development and before marketing authori
zation is granted the safety of a new medicine is evaluated in
preclinical studies including reproductive toxicity studies in
mammals In addition the safety information for new medi
cines may be supplemented by pooling data from patients
who unexpectedly become pregnant during the preapproval
clinical trials In the absence of safety concerns or signals
related to pregnancy exposure during drug development once
the new medicine is on the market it is subjected to safety
monitoring using pharmacovigilance procedures Solicited
or spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions
ADRs including adverse pregnancy outcomes e g congen
ital anomalies and pregnancy exposure with and without
ADRs are collected by marketing authorization holders and
regulatory authorities such as the EMA however it is esti
mated that only of all ADRs are spontaneously reported
and reporting is vulnerable to bias Therefore there
is a need to supplement spontaneous reports and solicited
reports of ADRs with data from other sources for exam
ple by secondary use of routinely collected healthcare data
to further investigate the potential harms risks and benefits
Use of whole population data removes selection bias including
volunteer bias Even if use of a medicine is not recom
mended or contraindicated in pregnancy women unaware
of their pregnancies may receive a prescription or there may
be no alternative to treat maternal conditions Therefore
many new medicines are first used in secondary or tertiary
care under specialist supervision however some healthcare
databases do hold information on hospital prescribing DUS
were defined by the World Health Organization as studies
which study the marketing distribution prescription and
use of medicinal products in a society with special emphasis
on the resulting medical and socioeconomic consequences
The thalidomide tragedy may have faded from public
consciousness but the failure to act on the teratogenicity
and neurodevelopmental harms of valproic acid derivatives
for over two decades from to indicates that
the problem persists It has been reported that it takes
on average years confidence interval CI
years to determine the safety of a new medicine in pregnant
women therefore there is a need to help expedite the
safety evaluation for new medicines and enantiomers A
drug utilization study DUS can help by adding effciency
to medication safety evaluation during pregnancy
Several guidelines and books consider
DUS in the general nonpregnant population The book
Drug Utilization Research Methods and Applications pre
sents a broad introduction to drug utilization measures
Journal of Pregnancy
and research The World Health Organization s guide
line focuses on establishing a DUS ENCEPP Safe
GUARD provides examples of DUS and Rasmussen
et al list the core concepts that can be used in DUS these
authors list appropriate analytical approaches for designing
a DUS e g basic epidemiological measures adherence
combinations of medicines switching polypharmacy and
drug misuse A tool was developed in to assess
the quality of DUS and drug utilization reviews however
this tool was created for primary data collection often in
relation to audit or prescribing quality rather than pharma
coepidemiological studies involving routine healthcare data
bases The EQUATOR network offers guidelines on
observational studies and pharmacoepidemiological
studies using routine healthcare data To our knowl
edge there is no specific guideline for DUS during preg
nancy using secondary data sources that details items to be
captured recorded and reported The objectives of this liter
ature review are to identify and review DUS for new
medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding list and sum
marise key information items to be reported in a DUS for
new medicines in the last years in pregnancy and
report on the earliest timeframe between introduction to
the market and evaluation of DUS during pregnancy
This publication is part of the Innovative Medicines Ini
tiative IMI ConcePTION project which aims to build an
ecosystem for better monitoring and communication of
medication safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding The
results of this study will help guide future DUS for new
drugs in pregnancy and potentially breastfeeding breast
feeding was omitted due to lack of data
Methods
Literature Search To identify postmarketing DUS of new
medicines in pregnancy a systematic review was undertaken
in two stages In PubMed Embase and the ENCePP
EU PAS Register were searched The publication date was lim
ited to through The search was
restricted to publications in English for further details on
the search strategy see Appendix The inclusion criterion
was assessment of the utilization of new medicines during
pregnancy or breastfeeding New medicines were defined
as those that reached the market within years of the date of
data analysis or review New medicines include new mole
cules enantiomers generics biosimilars and formulations
In addition data were collected on routes of administration
and indications In the ENCePP EU PAS Register preg
nancy were selected as other population and drug utiliza
tion study was selected under scope of study The register
did not have an option to search breastfeeding lactation
Studies identified via the ENCePP EU PAS Register were
included if they mentioned that they were going to study drug
utilization in pregnancy or breastfeeding in their protocol
Screening Studies with only the abstract available were
excluded
All titles and abstracts were initially screened to identify

Data Extraction Five reviewers JS KW MS JM and
DM undertook data extraction from the included studies
using a data extraction Excel sheet Information on key
aspects of a DUS was extracted from the title introduction
methods tables results and discussion of each included study
The key aspects of the studies were the pertinent items of
information reported Each study was scrutinized by two
researchers independently and findings were compared The
findings were consistent and there were no disagreements
Data Synthesis All the extracted information from the
included studies was captured in Excel tables
Developing Recommendations Information items
reported in the published studies and protocols were tabu
lated in an Excel file Once the items were identified we
returned to all studies and calculated the number of stud
ies reporting each information item This number is
included next to each item and helps us understand which
items are commonly included
Results
After removing the duplicates a total of unique poten
tially relevant studies were identified in PubMed and
Embase However none of the studies were DUS for new
drugs The search in the ENCePP EU PAS Register identified
studies Thirty seven studies were excluded because they
did not include a study concept protocol or study report
n or because they were not in English n Of the
studies screened were DUS Twenty three were
excluded because they did not study a new drug and were
excluded because they did not included data on either preg
nancy or breastfeeding Figure PRISMA
In total DUS posted in the ENCEPP EU PAS Register
within years after EMA medicine approval were included
for review There were studies including information on
use of medications during pregnancy in which only the pro
tocol was available for these we extracted information
related to the methods The other studies presented study
reports For all these information was extracted from these
to describe the components to be considered when con
ducting DUS of new medicines No studies considering
breastfeeding were identified
The patients were prescribed either a specific medicine
or a drug class There was only one study that exclusively
studied pregnant women study Table and one
study that focused on women of childbearing age study
Table The other studies evaluated drug utilization
in the general population for all users of the medicine s in
question and included a subgroup analysis of the estimated
prevalence of prescribing the medicine of interest to preg
nant women Four studies reported that there were no preg
nant women prescribed the medicine studies
and Table and two did not mention preg
nant women in the report but did in their protocol studies

TABLE Possible objectives of a drug utilization study in pregnancy
To assess if pregnant women are being prescribed or dispensed a specific new medicine
To assess the feasibility of conducting a pregnancy safety study for a newly approved medicine
are pregnant women and or women of childbearing age using the medicine by generating data for a sample size calculation
To estimate the prevalence of use amongst pregnant women or all women or those of childbearing age
To describe patterns of drug use in childbearing pregnant women dose formulation routes of administration
repeat prescriptions trimester of use and switching to other medicines or discontinuing any or all medicines
To estimate the prevalence of the condition amongst women of childbearing age and the proportion using the medicine
those of a similar class and other medicines for the condition
To estimate the prevalence of drug use or drug class in women before during first second and third trimester and or after
pregnancy and during breastfeeding
To estimate the prevalence of drug or drug class use in women of childbearing age or pregnant women by subgroups e g
socioeconomic status ethnicity clinical conditions indications concomitant prescribing smoking or substance misuse
demographics including age country region rurality calendar years
To assess potential comparator groups for safety studies in pregnancy when it is not clear which group of
patients would be the best comparators e g patients with the disease not taking a medicine or using other medicines
To describe and or compare drug utilization in populations over time and or according to
other characteristics such as socioeconomic status
To compare the patient profiles of pregnant women using the medicine of interest with those prescribed other
medicines for the same indications disease
and clinical safety data on the medicine and similar medicines
during pregnancy If information on safety in pregnancy or
breastfeeding is unknown this should be stated
For a new medicine on the market readers will need to
understand when the new medicine was approved by regula
tory authorities and when it was launched and available in
the countries regions under investigation There are cases
where there is a considerable delay between the regulatory
approval date and the availability of the new medicine in
routine care mainly driven by reimbursement decisions
guidelines or prescribers caution There may be fur
ther delays before data are available for research due to time
lag in the databases Table lists information that is perti
nent to contextualization of the results of a DUS If informa
tion is unobtainable or unknown this should be noted
The last part of the introduction should explain the pur
pose of conducting the DUS Table describes appropriate
objectives for DUS For example a DUS can help determine
whether the contributing databases are adequate for possible
further safety studies on a new medicine e g if the medi
cine and timing of administration are fully recorded
Items for a DUS Methods and Results
Databases Table lists items to be considered in the
methods and results section of a DUS for a new medicine
DUS typically use large population based databases e g
prescription databases reimbursement claims databases or
linked health service records If the DUS is used to plan a
future pregnancy safety study the numbers of exposed and
unexposed pregnancies in the DUS can be used to determine
the achievable level of precision for the risk of predefined
adverse pregnancy outcomes If several databases are
included results should be stratified by country database to
identify similarities and differences between databases This
will determine if it is appropriate to plan a meta analysis
or aggregated multilevel analysis in further studies Potential
confounding factors should be included to address threats to
validity in real world settings any associations between
maternal medicines and infant outcomes may be con
founded by concomitant exposures and demographic fac
tors All possible confounding variables should be
described by group with or without inferential analyses
Items for a DUS Considerations for Study Discussion
Table describes topics that should be considered for inclu
Sion in the discussion section
Discussion
We identified very few published DUS designed to deter
mine the use of new medicines in pregnant or breastfeeding
women Most studies were aimed at determining if pregnant
women were taking the medicine of interest From the eight
studies that presented results five did not identify any
women prescribed the medicine of interest and two did not
present any information on pregnancy in their study reports
Publication bias is possible given that studies identifying
zero or very few exposed pregnant women may not be pub
lished or if pregnant women exposed this may not be
published due to governance restrictions on reporting of
low numbers Low numbers of recorded exposures dur
ing pregnancy or breastfeeding during the medicine s first
years on the market militates against safety assessments
should the medicine be used by these vulnerable groups
Establishing consortia of databases including primary sec
ondary and tertiary care data for DUS in pregnancy and
breastfeeding would address this problem If no
exposed pregnancies are identified across several whole
population databases with primary secondary and tertiary
care prescribing it would suggest that the medicine is not
being prescribed to pregnant women and further safety

Validity of data on indication for prescription If algorithms are used to establish
indication these should have high specificity and sensitivity as determined by internal
exploration or the available literature
Use of birth registers and or algorithms to identify pregnancies within the database
including multiple pregnancies
Best estimates of start and end dates of a pregnancy and how these are obtained Use of
sensitivity analyses where not all pregnancies have ultrasound dating
Trimesters with definitions
Trimester from ISt day last menstrual period LMP to day after LMP or end of
pregnancy whichever earlier
