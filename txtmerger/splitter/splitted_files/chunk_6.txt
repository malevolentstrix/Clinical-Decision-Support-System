Within couple differences in fertility preferences might translate
into within couple differences in preferences for FPS For example the
husband might have a stronger preference for FPS than his wife if he
has weaker fertility preferences than his wife e g when the husband
does not want another child while the wife does If the positive effect of
the involvement of the husband is driven by the husband s preference
for FPS we should find that this effect is stronger among couples where
the husband has a weaker fertility preference than his wife than
among couples where the spouses have the same fertility preferences
or the wife has weaker fertility preferences than her husband
To test this we interact the treatment variables with spousal pref
erence differences The results are reported in column in
Table
In this column Var takes the value one if the husband has a need for
family planning while the wife does not of the couples Var
is zero whenever the husband and the wife have the same preferences
or the wife has weaker fertility preferences than the husband First we
note that if the husband does not have weaker fertility preferences than
his wife involving the husband still increases the likelihood that FPS
are chosen as can be seen by the positive and significant coefficients
on JD and HD If the husband has weaker fertility preferences the
treatment differences become larger but not significantly so Thus
differences in fertility preferences do not appear to be driving the
treatment differences
The link between the husband s fertility preferences and his pref
erence for FPS could depend on whether he is aware that his wife
already uses modern contraceptives
Table
shows that husbands
compared to their wife are less likely to report that they use modern
contraceptives This implies that even where spouses have the same fer
tility preferences the husband may have a stronger preference for FPS
than the wife if he does not know that they are using contraceptives
To test whether this could explain the positive effect of the husband s
involvement in the decision we interact the treatment variables with
the husband s unawareness of contraceptive use in column in
Table
The husband s unawareness of contraceptive use is defined
as an indicator variable taking the value one if the wife reports using
Journal of Development Economics
modern contraceptives while the husband does not zero otherwise
This is the case in of the couples If the husband s unawareness of
contraceptive use is driving our results we would expect the interaction
Table
to be positive and significant As can be seen the
terms in
interaction term with JD is negative and the interaction term with
HD is far from significant suggesting that the husband s awareness of
contraceptive use is not driving the results
A third factor that might influence the treatment effects is the
husband s unmet need for FP which combines his fertility preferences
and awareness of contraceptive use In particular if the husband has an
unmet need for FP while the wife does not either because of differences
in fertility preferences or different reporting of contraceptive use
involving the husband might increase the uptake of FPS In
Table
unmet need for FP is an indicator variable taking the value one if
the husband has an unmet need for FP while the wife does not of
couples zero otherwise We again expect the interaction terms to be
positive and significant if these couples are driving the results As can
be seen this is not the case suggesting that this factor does not drive
the positive effect of the husband s involvement
Knowledge about FP
Men might have lower knowledge about the benefits and costs of
FP than their wives This is in line with e g Ashraf et al
who
showed that men have lower knowledge about reproductive health risks
mostly related to labor and delivery outcomes than women If men
have a need for knowledge their lower knowledge might translate into
a stronger preference for FPS where knowledge can be obtained
To test whether this mechanism explains the positive effect of the
husband s involvement we use data from the survey in which we
asked the respondents a set of knowledge questions about FP These
questions range from the efficacy of contraceptives to pregnancy risks
see Table A in Appendix A For each statement a relatively large
fraction of both women and men answer that they do not know whether
the statement is true or not of women and of men answer
do not know on at least one of the five statements Women are
significantly less likely to give this answer than men times vs
times p from a two sided t test
To investigate whether the lack of knowledge about FP influences
the treatment effects we interact the treatments with the difference in
knowledge between the husband and the wife If lack of knowledge is
driving the treatment effects we expect small or no treatment differ
ences when the husband has an equal or larger amount of knowledge
about FP than the wife Further we expect the interaction terms to be
positive and significant which would indicate that husbands with less
knowledge about FP are driving the results
Table
displays the results
In column we interact the treatment variables with an indicator
variable taking the value one if the husband answers do not know
more frequently than the wife of couples In column we use
the difference in do not know answers between the husband and the
wife when the husband answers do not know more frequently than
the wife it is zero otherwise The average difference is questions
with a standard deviation of As can be seen neither of the
interaction terms are significant suggesting that a lack of knowledge
is not driving the results
Hyperbolic time preferences
As option B is conditional on attending a FP meeting at the local
health center it can be used as a commitment device This implies that
the husband might have a stronger preference for FPS if he benefits
more from its use as a commitment device than his wife To test this we
look at the participants time preferences It has been demonstrated that
people might have a preference for commitment if they have hyperbolic
time preferences i e they are more patient in the future than in the
present see e g Ashraf et al
We elicit time preferences by asking the participants to choose
between a hypothetical smaller reward the day after the experiment

The same question was also asked for a later time frame six versus
seven months to identify potential reversals in time preferences see
Section D of the Appendix for more details We define an individual
to have hyperbolic time preferences if the estimated discount rate is
higher in the near time frame than the later time frame
We do not find any gender differences in discount rates On average
husbands and wives have a discount rate of and respec
tively in the nearer time frame p value from two sided t test
In the later time frame women are slightly more patient than men with
a monthly discount rate of and respectively p value from

If participants used option B as a commitment device we should
find that the proportion of decisions where FPS is chosen is higher
among the participants with hyperbolic time preferences We test this in
columns in
Table
As can be seen the coefficients are negative
and not significant indicating that the choice of FPS is not used as
a commitment device in the individual treatments Therefore we do
not expect that a difference in hyperbolic time preferences between
the husband and the wife influences the treatment differences This
is indeed what we find in column Given that we are looking
for a mechanism behind the positive effect of husband s involvement
on the choice of FPS we focus on the case where the husband has
hyperbolic time preferences and the wife has not As can be seen by the
insignificant interaction terms this is not driving the treatment effects
Inaccurate beliefs
The second explanation for the positive effect of the husband s
involvement assumes that women have inaccurate beliefs about their
husband s preferences for FP In patriarchal societies in low income
countries FP is often a contentious topic which might generate spousal
disagreement or even conflict This makes it difficult for women to
initiate a conversation about this topic Mosha et al Amo
Adjei et al
As a result there tends to be little discussion or
communication among spouses about FP In Panel D of Table we

see that only of the couples reported that they discussed FP with
their partner in the past year This could make beliefs about spousal
preferences inaccurate
To see how the treatment predictions change when the wife has
inaccurate beliefs about her husband s preferences we rewrite the
wife s ultimate utility function in Eq
Uw x
x
where E is the expectation operator over a set U of utility functions for
h We assume that incomplete information is only a problem when the
decision is made individually by the wife as there is no communication
between the spouses In JD in contrast both spouses will get to know
each other s preferences as they make the decision together
When discussing beliefs we refer to beliefs about the personal
preference ordering of the spouse If the wife has inaccurate beliefs
it means that she believes that the husband gets more personal utility
from A than B while the opposite is true As long as Eueuuh B uh B
having inaccurate beliefs lowers the likelihood that the wife chooses
B Thus if there is no conflict in the household inaccurate beliefs
might lead to Pareto dominated choices when the decision is made
individually For example if us B us A for both spouses but the
wife has inaccurate beliefs the likelihood that B is chosen is lower
when the decision is made by the wife than when it is made jointly
or by the husband assuming that he has accurate beliefs In this case
if inaccurate beliefs lead the wife to choose A instead of B both spouses
would have been better off if the decision had been B
Thus the theory shows that if the wife incorrectly expects her
husband to prefer A involving the husband increases the likelihood

a mean in Wife Decision WD when Wife s beliefs is equal to O
that FPS are chosen We will look for evidence that supports this
prediction In the survey conducted before the experiment we asked
the participants whether they believed that their spouse agreed with
the use of contraceptives Even though this is not a measure of the
wife s beliefs about their husband s preferences over options A and B
there is a clear link between attending a FP meeting and the use of
contraceptives the couples need to attend such a meeting to receive
free contraceptives Therefore we use this measure as a proxy for the
wives beliefs about their husband s preferences over the two options
Overall as shown in
of the women in our sample believe
Table
that their husband approves of contraceptives and believe that
their husband disapproves The remaining category includes women
who either do not know or believe that the spouse is indifferent
If women s beliefs are behind the positive effect of the husband s
involvement we should find that this effect is strongest among couples
where the wife believes that her husband disapproves of contraceptives
To test this we interact the treatment variables with women s beliefs
Table

of decisions where FPS are chosen in column the proportion for
Wife FPS i e where only the wife had to attend a FP meeting in
column and the proportion for Couple FPS i e where both the
wife and the husband had to attend a FP meeting in column We
report the results for each condition separately to verify whether the
effects differ between both conditions
Two findings are worth noting First the coefficients of JD and
HD are positive and statistically significant in all columns This
The question asked whether they thought that their spouse agreed with
couples in general using contraceptives In this way we avoided that they had
to think about their own relationship which might bias reporting Moreover
we did not ask directly about their beliefs about their spouse s preference
over options A and B because this could either bias their decisions in the
experiment if we elicited these beliefs before the decisions were made or the
beliefs themselves could be biased if we elicited them after the decisions were
made
Journal of Development Economics
indicates that among couples where the wife does not believe that her
husband approves of contraceptives involving the husband increases
the proportion of decisions where FPS are chosen In JD the proportion
is between and percentage points higher than in WD and
in HD the proportion is percentage points higher Second the
coefficients of the interaction terms JD X Beliefs and HD X Beliefs
are negative and statistically significant This indicates that the differ
ences between the WD treatment and each of the other treatments are
significantly smaller when the wife believes that her husband approves
of contraceptives
These results suggest that women incorrectly believe that their
husband disapproves of contraceptives which makes women less likely
to choose FPS if their husband is not involved in the decision Note
that we do not have data on the true preferences of each spouse and
can therefore not directly test whether beliefs are accurate However
we do have data on the desired number of children of each spouse
as well as their beliefs about the desired number of children of their
spouse We expect that the desired number of children correlates closely
with preferences about options A and B We find that in of the
couples the wife reports not knowing how many children her husband
wants and out of the couples where the wife does report how many
children she thinks her husband wants she overestimates the number
in of the couples Moreover among the couples where the wife
makes an estimate on how many children her husband wants there is
a negative correlation between the number of children she believes her
spouse wants and whether she believes her spouse approves of contra
ceptives spearman s p p Both observations taken
together suggest that women s beliefs about their spouse s approval of
contraceptives are downward biased as we assumed when interpreting
the regression results above
In sum these observations together with the significant interaction
terms in the regressions support that the positive effect of the hus
band s involvement is driven by women s inaccurate beliefs about their
husband s preferences
The wife s expected utility of B
Our model so far ignored any possible actions taken after the
experiment However it might be that our participants anticipated
any post experimental actions when making their decisions in the lab
The third and last mechanism that we explore assumes that the wife s
expected utility of option B Euw B might be lower in WD than in
the other treatments because she anticipates post experimental actions
Note that this is different from the previous mechanism where we as
sumed there was certainty about the utility of option B and uncertainty
about the husband s preferences
In
Table
the Wife s beliefs indicator variable takes the value O either
if the wife believes that the husband disapproves of contraceptives or if she
does not know As a robustness test we do the same analysis only with couples
where the wife either believes that the husband approves or disapproves As
can be seen in Table A in Appendix A the results are robust
The main reason why we did not use beliefs about the desired number of
children in the regression is that in of the couples the wife reported not
knowing the husband s preferences making it difficult to compare with the
husband s reported number of children
This bears some resemblance to a potential undoing problem which
complicates intra household experiments
In many couple
Munro
experiments there is a risk that decisions can be undone after the experiment
For example a husband who disagrees with the decisions made by their wife
can reallocate economic resources received in an experiment That husbands
can claim transfers from their wife is supported by Anderson and Baland
who document how women use local saving groups to protect savings
from their husband s claims It is important to clarify that while the decisions
made in our lab experiment cannot be undone some actions taken after the
experiment can change the utility of options A and B
B D and C Ringdal
Specifically if option B is chosen it is possible that the husband
does not allow their wife to attend the FP meeting or does not join their
wife when this is a condition i e with the couple FPS In that case they
do not receive any payment and option B becomes less attractive The
perceived likelihood that the conditionality is fulfilled is reduced in the
WD treatment as women are often unable to make decisions on their
own about their mobility or have limited access to resources Note that
these are typical measures of women s empowerment and bargaining
Malapit et al Bandiera et al For example in
power
our sample only of the women can decide alone whether to visit
their family or friends If women have limited mobility and access to
resources their expected utility of B might be lower in WD since they
would have to negotiate with their husband to use household resources
or leave the house to visit the local health center
In our model this would be captured as follows Assume that the
wife assigns probability O p I that she attends the FP meeting
and probability l p that she does not Then the expected utility
from choosing option B assuming that she obtains no utility if the
conditionality is not fulfilled is
Euw B puw B puw B
This implies that a lower expectation that the conditionality is
fulfilled leads to a lower likelihood that option B is chosen When the
decision is made jointly in JD we assume that the likelihood that the
conditionality is fulfilled if B is chosen is higher than in WD This is
the case as the husband would not choose option B if he was unwilling
to approve women s mobility or the use of household resources needed
to visit the health center and thus fulfill the conditionality
To obtain an idea of the expectation that the conditionality is
fulfilled we asked the participants how likely it was that they would
attend a FP meeting if option B was selected for payment At that point
participants had made all decisions but the selection of the decision
was not made yet hence the participants did not know yet whether
they would need to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment All
participants who made a decision i e women only in WD men only in
HD and both spouses in JD answered this question even the ones who
never chose option B Note that the plausible deniability mechanism we
used made these participants face a non zero chance that they would
need to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment
To elicit the individual expectation that the conditionality would be
fulfilled we asked whether it was very unlikely unlikely neither
unlikely nor likely likely or very likely that i the wife and ii
the husband would attend the FP meeting if option B was chosen for
payment In the following we have converted these alternatives into
a scale from to where indicates very unlikely and very
likely The elicited beliefs are highly correlated with the choice of FPS

In general the expectation that the conditionality will be fulfilled is
high with most respondents finding it likely or very likely that they will

that the husband s beliefs do not vary between treatments For the

need to attend the FP meeting Couple FPS we find that the wife s
expectations about the husband s attendance are significantly higher in

treatments in expectations for Wife FPS it is unlikely that uncertainty
about the attendance of the FP meeting can explain the full treatment
effects
The expected utility of option B may also be lower for women who
suffer from intimate partner violence IPV especially if they believe
that there is a chance that the husband may become violent if she
committed herself to visit the health center by choosing option B
without consulting him Table A in Appendix A shows that being
subjected to IPV does not affect the treatment differences
Attendance of FP meeting and contraceptive use
In this section we extend the analysis by looking at behavior after
the decisions are made in the lab Specifically we test i whether the
FP meeting is attended and whether contraceptives are chosen at the FP
meeting if option B is chosen for payment and ii whether the uptake
of contraceptives is higher if option B is chosen For these analyses we
use data collected by the nurse at the health center and data reported
by the participants when they received the payments
The FP meeting
In this section we look at the treatment effects on i the atten
dance of the FP meeting conditional on option B being chosen for
payment and on ii contraceptive use conditional on attending the
FP meeting This analysis tells us whether the husband s involvement
matters for the fulfillment of the condition of option B and whether the
husband s involvement or presence at the FP meeting affects the uptake
of contraceptives

In these two rows the sample sizes are the number of couples in

result is in line with the wife s expectations about the attendance of the
FP meeting see Section it is more likely that the FP meeting is
attended if the decision in the lab is made jointly than if the decision
is made by the wife alone
Next we investigate what happens once the wife or the couple are at
the FP meeting of the wives that attended a FP meeting received
modern contraceptives The presence of the husband at the FP meeting
does not affect the uptake of contraceptives no difference between
Couple FPS and Wife FPS two sided t test p As can be
seen from the third and fourth rows of

they attend the FP meeting

the uptake of LARC does not
depend on whether the husband is involved in the decision in the lab
but it does depend on whether the husband attended the FP meeting
with Wife FPS and with Couple FPS two sample
two sided t test p
In sum once option B is chosen for payment most couples attend a
FP meeting Once at the meeting most couples receive contraceptives
and a non negligible fraction of them receive LARC These findings can
also be interpreted as evidence against a potential social desirability
bias that might confound the treatment effects It is plausible that the
participants wanted to appear more in favor of using FPS than they
actually are in order to please our research team if they assumed
that we care about contraceptive use remember that their decisions
were recorded by one of the enumerators Such bias might increase the
overall proportion of decisions where FPS are chosen and confound the
treatment differences if this bias is stronger among the husbands than
among the wives in our sample
The husbands who choose FPS only to please us would then try to
make sure that their choice does not translate into reduced fertility
They could do so by i not attending a FP meeting ii not accepting
any contraceptives at the meeting or iii only accepting short term
contraceptives at the meeting As we have seen the involvement of the
husband does not reduce the likelihood of a FP meeting being attended
or the uptake of contraceptives We take this as evidence against a
social desirability bias that might affect our results
For women it is difficult to disentangle social desirability bias from the
effect of low mobility and control over resources However we can compare
The effect of the choice of FPS on contraceptive use
We observed that a large proportion of the couples for which option
B was chosen for payment attended a FP meeting and once at the
FP meeting a large proportion chose contraceptives It is interesting
to test whether having to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment
translates into an increase in contraceptive use Note that the couples
for which option A was chosen could still have taken up contraceptives
outside the experiment To test this we need to deal with potential
endogeneity that might bias the estimate of the effect of FPS services
To do so we exploit the random assignment to treatments and the
finding that the involvement of the husband increased the uptake of
FPS This allows us to use the treatment assignment as an instrumental
variable for the choice of FPS
To test whether the uptake of contraceptives is influenced by the
selection of FPS we regress contraceptive use as reported on the
payment date on the selection of FPS
Table
displays the results In columns the selection of
FPS is treated as exogenous To deal with potential endogeneity in
columns we instrument the selection of FPS by the experimental
treatments As shown by the first stage the choice of FPS is higher when
the husband is involved i e in both JD and HD with the exception of
JD when the condition is Wife FPS see column
Table
shows that the choice of FPS increases contraceptive use
significantly When treating FPS as exogenous the likelihood that
contraceptives are chosen increases by around percentage points if
option B is chosen for payment The size of this effect is around per
centage points smaller when taking into account potential endogeneity
bias
the reports of women and nurses on the uptake of contraceptives at the FP
meeting If women report a higher uptake of contraceptives than nurses this
can be an indication of a social desirability bias Among the couples who
attended the family planning meeting of the women reported that they
received contraceptives which is very close to the as reported by the
nurses Spearman s p p
A few participants were not interviewed when we visited them to give
their payment This was the case where the option chosen gave a zero payment
to both the wife and the husband of the couples Despite this one
of these women still attended the payment session even though no payment
was given The rest are excluded from the analysis In addition of the
remaining couples did not show up to receive payment Of these women
had attended the FP meeting and we therefore use the report from the nurse
The remaining couples are excluded from the analysis implying that about
are excluded from this analysis
Note that the use of the plausible deniability mechanism might have
decoupled for some participants the link between the treatments and the final
selection of the payment which might have weakened the treatment effects
in the first stage

Discussion and conclusion
In this paper we report the results of an experiment in which
couples can choose a payment conditional on receiving FPS at a local
health facility We find that involving the husband increases the likeli
hood that couples choose FPS Most couples that need to attend FPS to
receive a payment visit the health center and once there most of them
choose to continue or start to use contraceptives In sum our study
demonstrates that the husband has a very strong influence in the first
stage of the decision making process which is essential for the uptake
of FPS and modern contraceptives
Using a household model that assumes complete information about
spousal preferences and complete certainty about the fulfillment of the
conditionality our finding that the husband s involvement increases
the likelihood that FPS are chosen can only be explained if men have
stronger preferences for FPS than women We do not find evidence for
this assumption In a next step we extend our theoretical model and
test two alternative mechanisms that could explain the positive effect of
the husband s involvement First we show theoretically that inaccurate
beliefs about spousal preferences can explain the observed treatment
effects We find strong evidence in support of this mechanism the
positive effect of involving the husband is driven by couples where
the wife believes that the husband does not approve of contraceptives
Second we consider the role of the wife s expectations concerning the
likelihood that a FP meeting is attended We find some support for this
mechanism the expectation that the Couple FPS payment condition
is fulfilled is larger when the husband is involved in the decisions in
the lab
Our results are in line with several qualitative and observational

are more likely to be correct if the couple discusses family planning
Our analysis confirms that initiating communication among spouses is
a sufficient condition to increase the likelihood that FPS are chosen
JD forces the couples to communicate In sum our study has not
only provided experimental evidence that supports the policy advice
from these studies to stimulate communication among spouses It has
also generated new insights into why and when it could increase the
uptake of contraceptives In particular we demonstrated that the effect
of a lack of communication or the non involvement of the husband
risks creating inaccurate beliefs about spousal preferences which could
make women reluctant to use FPS It is also clear from our analysis that
a policy that stimulates communication among spouses would only be
effective where spouses do not have substantially different preferences
about FPS
Our study also complements the insights generated by other ex
perimental studies on the husband s involvement Ashraf et al
demonstrated that bypassing the husband could increase women s up
take of contraceptives where men want more children and have higher
bargaining power than women However this might lower women s
subjective well being due to increased spousal dissatisfaction In a
more recent study
Ashraf et al showed that increasing the
husband s knowledge about maternal health costs reduces pregnancy
rates without affecting spousal satisfaction Treating husbands not only
lowers their desired fertility it also leads to more frequent communica
tion about family planning and higher marital satisfaction They also
find that husbands have more accurate beliefs about their wife s fertility
preferences
McCarthy found that the husband s involvement
reduces pregnancy rates but not where there is recent IPV We do
not investigate the effect of the husband s involvement on knowledge
or spousal satisfaction Further in contrast with McCarthy we
do not find that the husband s involvement interacts with IPV Our
results demonstrate that the husband s involvement has the potential
to increase the uptake of contraceptives by correcting women s beliefs
about their husband s fertility preferences
More broadly our findings indicate that where information about
spousal preferences is incomplete existing household models should
incorporate individual beliefs about spousal preferences as an addi
tional parameter This increases the complexity of household models
and broadens the set of potential effects of the involvement of the
husband It also opens the door to potential efficiency losses when
decisions are made individually In our setting characterized by large
gender inequality and inaccurate beliefs about spousal preferences this
translates in a positive effect of the husband s involvement on the
uptake of the opportunities offered Our results suggest that reaching
out to women might be less effective if the husband is not involved
In particular there is a considerable risk that opportunities offered to
women remain then underutilized
The results presented in this paper point to several avenues for fu
ture research First we need more theoretical and empirical research on
the role of incomplete information in household bargaining to achieve
a better understanding of household decision making Why is there
incomplete information in the household and how can this be modeled
theoretically In what domains do we observe incomplete informa
tion between spouses Second further research on intra household
communication about fertility preferences is necessary to increase our
understanding of intra household decision making and its effect on
contraceptive use For example more evidence is needed on the con
ditions under which such communication takes place and could be
facilitated Finally it is likely that communication influences efficiency
in household decision making in other domains as well where spouses
potentially think they disagree While we focused on contraceptives
on which we know there tends to be little discussion among spouses in
patriarchal societies in low income countries similar questions can be
asked about other domains where there is little communication among
spouses

Abstract
Background
Computerized decision support systems CDSS and performance based incentives PBls can improve
health worker performance However there is minimal evidence on the combined effects of these interventions or
perceived effects among maternal and child healthcare providers in low resource settings We thus aimed to explore
the perceptions of maternal and child healthcare providers of CDSS support in the context of a combined CDSS PBI
intervention on performance in twelve primary care facilities in Ghana s Upper East Region
Methods We conducted a qualitative study drawing on semi structured key informant interviews with nurses
and midwives health facility managers and district level staff familiar with the intervention We analysed data
thematically using deductive and inductive coding in NVivo software
Results Interviewees suggested the combined CDSS PBI intervention improved their performance through enhanc
ing knowledge of maternal health issues facilitating diagnoses and prescribing prompting actions for complications
and improving management Some interviewees reported improved morbidity and mortality However challenges
described in patient care included CDSS software inflexibility e g requiring administration of only one intermittent
preventive malaria treatment to pregnant women faulty electronic partograph leading to unnecessary referrals
increased workload for nurses and midwives who still had to complete facility forms and power fluctuations affecting
software

Conclusion
Combining CDSS and PBI interventions has potential to improve maternal and child healthcare provi
Sion in low income settings However user perspectives and context must be considered along with allowance for
revisions when designing and implementing CDSS and PBls interventions

Background
Frontline health worker performance is a common chal
lenge in resource constrained settings Health worker
behaviours are complex with many potential influences
though research indicates general enablers of improved
performance include in service training in use of tools
constructive feedback and receiving positive recognition
In low and middle income country LMIC health
systems performance is additionally constrained by staff
ing deficiencies and ad hoc task shifting thus weakening
capacity to achieve national and global health goals
Access to health infrastructure is indispensable but not
enough and poor quality of care impedes achieving
Sustainable Development Goal ensure healthy lives
and promote well being for all at all ages Therefore
health systems must ensure good quality care
A key example of this issue is maternal and neonatal
health MNH which cannot improve in LMICs without
ensuring the availability of adequate numbers of compe
tent and motivated providers at health facilities Despite
improvements in access to and use of MNH care in many
LMICs mortality rates remain high and gaps between
low income and high income countries continue The
high levels of mortality are attributed to poor quality of
care in the health facilities characterized by over
crowding and understaffing with inappropriate manage
ment of complicated deliveries and untimely response to
emergencies
Initial efforts focused on improving MNH provider
performance through in service trainings assuming
problems are due to inadequate knowledge and skills
Millions of training dollars later healthcare indica
tors are little improved and MNH providers still require
support Recognising training is not the only solu
tion more recent interventions involve infrastructure
improvements and advocacy for skilled birth attendance
Packages of interventions appear more effec
tive than single interventions For example assess
ment of Standards Based Management and Recognition
SBM RO for quality improvement in three Ethiopian
hospitals and eight health centres showed significant
improvement in MNH provider performance during
labour delivery and immediate postnatal services
Evidence suggests computerised decision support sys
tems CDSS and performance based incentives PBIs
could enhance health worker motivation and perfor
mance CDSS are electronic tools that prompt
provider behaviours with patient specific prompts
treatment guidelines automatic medication dosing cal
culations and reports of overdue tests and medications
PBIs involve compensating health workers for work
beyond their typical remit so they feel appreciated and
that effort is valued Offering monetary or other recog
nition for high performing employees aims to counter
act weak or indirect health system incentives
by directly linking rewards to actions that achieve per
formance targets and therefore contribute to improved
heal
