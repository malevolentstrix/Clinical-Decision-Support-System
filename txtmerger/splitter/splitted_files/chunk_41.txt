Discussion
Our population based cohort study fills an evidence
gap by examining which women should be considered at
high risk for adverse birth and infant outcomes on the
basis of multiple psychosocial risk factors recorded
routinely in hospital records during or before pregnancy
All of the psychosocial risk factors current or previous
teenage birth a history of adversity or mental health or
behavioural conditions or living in the most deprived
areas were associated with the adverse infant outcomes
of low birthweight unplanned admission for injury and
post discharge mortality The effect of these risk factors
was consistently high across all maternal age groups
Overall of women had at least one risk factor and
although teenage mothers were at highest risk of poor
infant outcomes the majority of women with at
least one risk factor were older than years at delivery
A major strength of our study is that we considered
multiple psychosocial risk factors and outcomes using
national data linking over million delivery and birth
records Without this linkage it would not have been
possible to evaluate how maternal exposures before
pregnancy influence infant outcomes A further
strength is that outcomes were based on national policy
priorities and that effect sizes were similar to those for
other well recognised risk factors for poor infant
outcomes For example the crude risk differences in
birthweight observed in this study were similar to those
seen when comparing smoking and non smoking
mothers g and relative risks were comparable

Table Adjusted population attributable fractions for low birthweight and unplanned admission for injury and mortality within the months from

to those identified for parental mental health and infant
injuries By considering and adjusting for a range
of psychosocial risk factors within a national cohort
our study fills a gap in evidence on which factors are
associated with the greatest population attributable risk
Our study was limited by definitions of mental health
or behavioural conditions and adversity that were based
on hospital data we only captured cases that were severe
enough to be recorded in a hospital admission record
However we included up to diagnostic codes and
so would have captured admissions related to these
conditions even when these conditions were not the
primary cause of admission We did not have information
on smoking or body mass index on the amount of
support families received eg number of home visits by
midwives or health visitors participation in the Family
Nurse Partnership FNP teenage pregnancy units and
housing or other services or on childhood developmental
outcomes However only up to a quarter of the of
first time teenage mothers in our study would have
received FNP during this period and any benefits of this
intervention are likely to have led to an underestimation
of the effects of psychosocial risk factors We did not
capture stillbirths or miscarriages which might also
have underestimated the effect of psychosocial risk
factors Our study included only singleton births and
we excluded mothers either younger than years or
older than years Future research could consider other
relevant outcomes eg presentations to emergency
departments and explore associations for the of
births to mothers with multiple deliveries during the
study period which were excluded in this study
Evaluating regional variation in risk factors and outcomes
could also be informative for policy Our findings apply
to England but could be generalisable to other countries
with similar maternal risk factors
Proportionate universalism the resourcing and
delivering of services that are universal but have a scale
and intensity proportionate to the level of disadvantage
is key to reducing health inequalities For this strategy to
work effectively susceptible groups need to be identified
early on the basis of disease burden or determinants of
health We show that routine hospital data can inform
www thelancet com public health February
Maternal age years
Figure Crude unadjusted association between maternal age and infant
mortality in the months from postnatal discharge
who to target and provide an approach for quantifying the
numbers of women at high risk Presentations to
hospital for emergency care for mental health or
behavioural conditions or adversity before weeks of
pregnancy provide important opportunities for
interventions before pregnancy including support for
reproductive choice eg ensuring timely access to
contraception and preconception health to improve
birth outcomes Such presentations during and after
pregnancy should also prompt emergency care services to
involve primary care and other community services to
support the mother and child to improve child outcomes
for example through access to mental health care or
intensive home visiting to build parenting capacity
ensure child safety mitigate the effects of adversity and
help prepare for subsequent pregnancies However
providing a universal service remains important for
identifying women with needs not meeting thresholds for
admission Improved data collection and completeness of
risk factor recording during antenatal visits and health
visiting contacts and improved data sharing and linkage
across health social care and education services could
support antenatal and health visiting services in making
Articles
judgements for individual families and strengthen
referral pathways between community and health care
services Such linkage would also facilitate research on
uptake and the wider societal benefits and costs of early
interventions and the opportunity costs of increased
targeting schemes in terms of diverting services from the
universal model
A further requirement for proportionate universalism
is effective interventions Interventions and specialised
services that are offered to women vary across England
The FNP which is targeted at first time teenage mothers
is one of the only programmes specifically recommended
within the Healthy Child Programme g However the
FNP only targets first time teenage mothers of
this study population whereas the highest risk of low
birthweight and preterm birth in our study was seen in
women with a history of mental health or behavioural
conditions or adversity who account for of women
across all age groups Health visiting as an intervention
for birth outcomes is too late more evidence is needed
on the propensity for these women to benefit from
interventions before and during pregnancy including
whether different models of care are needed for younger
versus older women with psychosocial risk factors
Our study provides evidence to support health services
planning and evidence to support decisions about
whether and how scarce universal public health services
should be targeted in the context of decreasing funding
for public health services and the workforce including
health visiting In terms of population attributable risk
deprivation was a key factor followed by teenage
pregnancy of women were current or previous
teenage mothers Similar to previous studies these
effects were not fully explained by adjusting for other
risk factors Our findings indicate that primary
prevention strategies could be targeted at the population
level on the basis of age and socioeconomic background
Such strategies need to integrate cross sectoral agencies
this integration has for example been done by the
multifaceted policy intervention to reduce teenage
pregnancies in England the Teenage Pregnancy
Strategy which involved health and education agencies
and both contributed to a decline in teenage births and
attenuated the steep deprivation gradient Previous
research has also shown that the effects of teenage
motherhood persist for previous teenage mothers giving
birth again in their meaning that strategies to
improve reproductive choices for young women about
the timing of their pregnancies could have lasting
effects There is a need to understand how existing
services eg for teenage pregnancies contraception
sexual health services and drug and alcohol services can
best be integrated with support in early years to address
the needs of women affected by psychosocial risk factors
Our results also support previous evidence showing
that having a history of admissions for mental health or
behavioural conditions or adversity is an important
potential risk indicator for poor infant outcomes that
should be considered when supporting individual
women in clinical practice A UK study using primary
care records showed that a majority of mothers registered
with a general practice had received mental health
treatment or diagnosis between the birth of their child
and the child s birthday Parental mental health is
strongly linked to child and adolescent mental health and
mortality in early adulthood The high prevalence of
these parental health problems points to the need for
services in primary care mental health and maternity
and child health to be more responsive to the needs of
parents to improve outcomes for parents and their
children
Our findings show disparities in adverse outcomes for
the of women with one or more of the psychosocial
risk factors measured in our study Given that our study
was not able to account for mental health problems not
recorded in hospital admission records and that we only
considered the highest quintile of deprivation our results
are probably an underestimate of the true burden of
adverse infant outcomes in the community Effective
interventions before during and after pregnancy
are needed to reduce the downstream burden on
health services and prevent long term adverse effects for
children Upstream public health and economic
strategies are important to reduce socioeconomic
disparities Within health care efforts are needed across
primary and secondary services to address potential
effects of psychosocial presentations among women on
pregnancy and child outcomes

The impact on postpartum care by telehealth
a qualitative evaluation of the patient
Check for updates
perspective
OBJECTIVE During the COVID pandemic many
obstetrical practices began to provide postpartum care via tel
ehealth to minimize patient and clinician risk Telehealth
during the pandemic has been associated with increased post
partum visit attendance overall and reduced racial disparities
in attendance
In this study we aimed to investigate
patient preferences regarding postpartum visit modalities
barriers to or facilitators of telehealth in the postpartum
period and patient experiences with postpartum tele
health including perception of the clinician patient relation
ship and contraceptive counseling
STUDY DESIGN We conducted a qualitative study using
individual semi structured interviews Methods are reported
according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualita
tive Research guidelines This study was approved by the
University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board and
all participants provided informed consent
Interviews were conducted with patients who had a telehealth
postpartum visit scheduled between October and Jan
uary at a single institution with no exclusions Each
interview was performed within weeks of when their
appointment was scheduled Participants were purposively
sampled by age race insurance status parity and mode of
delivery to reflect the local patient population with the goal of
obtaining thematic saturation among both patients who were
and those who were not able to attend their visits
Interviews were transcribed by ADA Transcription Services
Mount Holly NJ and uploaded to NVivo QSR Interna
tional Burlington MA Qualitative data analysis was per
formed using grounded theory and coded using a systematic
approach by coders All transcripts were at least coded twice
with excellent intercoder reliability kappa O
RESULTS A total of interviews were performed The par
ticipant characteristics are shown in Table In total of
participants attended their visit and half of those had an in
person postpartum visit for a previous pregnancy for compar
ison Representative quotes for each theme described are
shown in Table
Overall patient s perspectives on the visit modality were
mixed Importantly patients noted their preference was fluid
and depended on the purpose of the visit and their circum
stances In our sample of patients preferred an in person
visit and preferred a telehealth visit It was noted that
the preference of of the cohort was dependent on

col MFM
external factors such as the mode of delivery and need for
further testing Interviewees emphasized the value of shared
decision making regarding visit modality unless otherwise
clinically indicated
For those who attended the telehealth postpartum visit the
majority of respondents focused on convenience as the pri
mary facilitator Patients described the lack of need to arrange
childcare and transportation and less time spent waiting Par
ticipants also discussed their ability to multitask while com
pleting their visits such as actively breastfeeding In addition
patients appreciated the ease of scheduling in person follow
up visits when warranted
Participants across the groups were split when asked about
barriers to attending postpartum care Although the majority
reported that telehealth relieved the need for childcare some
patients expressed difficulty engaging with the appointment
because of child related distractions For some childcare pre
vented them from attending the telehealth visit altogether
The most reported barrier among those unable to attend tele
medicine visits was scheduling challenges Some of these
patients also reported privacy concerns such as the inability
to find a private space for this visit On the other hand most
interviewees who were able to attend reported that technolog
ical difficulties were the biggest barrier expressing confusion
with operating the videoconferencing application or poor
connectivity Both groups voiced concerns about visit logis
tics such as needing frequent reminders and some reported a
lack of confidence in obtaining the requested vital signs at
home
Although most participants attending the telehealth visit
reported meaningful clinician engagement some discussed
concerns related to clinician attention Others reported feel
ing that the visit lacked comprehensiveness and that even
with video functionality their physical examination such as a
cesarean incision could not be appropriately checked
Patients reported increased comfort with telehealth if they
had met the same clinician in person previously
Furthermore most participants reported having in depth
contraceptive counseling and having their decision respected
In contrast some patients outlined negative experiences dis
cussing perceptions of pressure to decide unawareness of
patient LGBTQ status or an unclear plan on how to obtain
the desired contraception method in person such as an intra
uterine device
CONCLUSION This qualitative analysis provides insight on
patients preferences regarding postpartum visit types bar

Exemplary quote
l think there are certain periods when telehealth visits is absolutely enough But there s I think some critical
parts that it is better to be seen actually be seen by a provider
Because juggling a newborn and that new schedule just log in from the comfort of your own home without
having to think about what you re gonna do with the newborn and working around their schedule it just made
it so much less stressful
It was nice because I m breastfeeding an infant so all I had to do was turn on my camera and I could continue
to take care of my daughter
Because right now it s a pandemic and I don t want to go inside of the building and risk my health or risk
anybody inside of that building s health
Which it is hard to find a space I guess and a time when you re doing telehealth and you have kids at home
l had a telephone appointment and it never said what time it was and I had missed the phone call
You feel more comfortable saying things in person than you do over the phone and being recorded like a
privacy thing
So the sound and image I mean we corrected the sound through talking on the phone But I could see the
image was still moving Not moving Pausing and freezing a lot
It s a big difference because I can check my blood pressure but I m not sure if I m doing it correctly
l really wanted to have an in person even though the virus situation because I would feel totally secure by
visiting the office and he has all the testings done Because I m pretty sure that some of the testings were also
just not done because of the telehealth visit
I d much rather do a video than a phone call I feel like that s more personal
If I could barely see her the provider she could barely see me probably So she could probably barely see my
incision And she said it was healing properly and fine but how can you really know for sure if you don t see it
in person
l do feel like over telehealth I was there seemed to be more flexibility with the time I definitely felt like my
appointments were longer with the telehealth calls than they were in person And maybe there is something to
be said about that
I d met her before in person so it was just a pretty comforting conversation
The provider just asked what kind of birth control I wanted to do and I m not totally sure exactly which one I
want yet But she discussed the pros and cons of each and how each type of birth control worked she
prescribed me something that we re thinking I m gonna go with but I can obviously change my mind
whenever

sons to improve postpartum telehealth as it continues to be a
driving care modality
Make modality of visit optional based on patient prefer

Include an appointment reminder system
Provide clear direction for previsit vitals
Maximize continuity of care between in person and tele

Background Elective single embryo transfers are being increasingly used to curb the increase in multiple gestation rates However
it has been documented that single embryo transfers could still result in twins and on rarer occasions in triplet pregnancies Main
Body A literature review was done to highlight the possible mechanisms leading to embryonic splitting In this review the
incidence of zygotic splitting was addressed and the notion of chorionicity was explained Risk factors for zygotic splitting and
suggested mechanisms for both twin and higher order pregnancies were suggested and discussed Conclusion The hypotheses
that we have so far remain unproven due to the rarity of zygotic splitting as well as the ethicolegal considerations of human
embryo research The presence of such incidents necessitates extensive counselling of the couple

tions the elective single embryo transfer eSET is currently
encouraged However blastocyst stage SET was still found to
be associated with multiple gestations The present data
revealed that the frequency of embryo splitting post eSET
is with the rate of monozygotic twin and triplet
pregnancies being and respectively
However dizygotic twin and triplet pregnancies can also
be encountered post eSET Both monozygotic and dizy
gotic pregnancies can occur in the setting of fresh embryo
transfers in natural or modified natural frozen embryo
transfers FET and rarely in medicated FET cycles
Such events challenge the twinning dogma proposed by

Incidence of Zygotic Splitting after SET
Single embryo transfer is becoming the most favored
method of ART conclusion in recent years as it decreased
the complications associated with multiple gestations In
Japan for example up to of cycles account for SET
However multiple gestations in the form of mono or
dizygotic twinning are still encountered The classic defini
tion of when one embryo undergoes fission into or more
genetically identical embryos is called monozygotic splitting
while when different embryos implant a dizygotic preg
nancy ensures According to Ikemoto et al the rate of mul
tiple gestation after eSET is with the frequency of twin
and triplet pregnancies being and respectively
The frequency of zygotic splitting post SET was estimated to
be The findings of monochorionic and multiple
chorionic pregnancies in blastocyst eSET confirmed the fact
that embryo splitting took place after the transfer However
not all pregnancies are monozygotic As per Osianlis et al
the calculated dizygotic rate in their paper was with
an overall Di Di birth rate of Based on these numbers
they concluded that of the multizygotic pregnancies
are due to actual embryo splitting while the other could
be explained by concomitant natural conception at the same
time of the ART conception On another level the Japanese
ART national registry database along with a survey done by
Yamashita et al documented triplet pregnancies of
which were single gestational sac pregnancies were
double gestational sac pregnancies and were with ges
tational sacs It is worth mentioning that the trichorionic
pregnancies had zero fetuses in cases fetus in cases
fetuses in cases and three fetuses in cases One qua
druplet case was also documented
Chorionicity
Chorionicity refers to the placenta the origin of which can be
determined accurately Zygosity on the other hand which is
the origin of the fetus can be predicted in half of the cases as
multiple gestation pregnancies can originate from one or
multiple embryos especially when the sex of the babies is dis
cordant Given this fact same sex twins or triplets could be
true monozygotic or dizygotic in origin The only way to
accurately diagnose the zygosity is to do DNA fingerprinting
which is expensive and thus not performed in daily practice
In contrast monochorionic multiple gestations are
always monozygotic Originally it was thought that the
earlier the embryonic division the more separate and inde
pendent the fetuses were In other words cleavage stage
divisions were believed to result in dichorionic diamniotic
pregnancies while blastocyst stage divisions resulted in
monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancies
According to Konno et al dichorionic pregnancies were
found to be more common with ART As such we can
conclude that SET can result in monozygotic monochorio
nic and multichorionic as well as dizygotic pregnancies
multichorionic pregnancies
Risk Factors
Naturally occurring twinning especially the dizygotic form
is believed to be linked to a genetic predisposition most com
monly located on chromosome Some ethnicities
were found to be more predisposed to dizygotic twinning
where the rate reached in Nigeria This con
trasts with the naturally occurring monozygotic twinning
which was found to be nonaffected by the ethnicity or the
genetic makeup of the couple ART on the other
hand has increased the incidence of monozygotic twining
It has been shown that the patient s young age might predis
pose to zygotic twinning while unexplained infertility was
found to be protective It was proposed that ART
associated embryo manipulations such as FET per se blasto
cyst culture and assisted hatching could be risk factors for
zygotic splitting while the zona manipulation of the oocyte
in the form of intracytoplasmic sperm insemination ICSI
was not Interestingly there was no difference in
Journal of Pregnancy
the splitting rate neither between the cleavage stage and
the blastocyst stage transfers nor between fresh and frozen
embryo transfer cycles Another risk factor for splitting
is a lower inner cell mass ICM grading of B or C It is
thought that loose intercellular connections may induce
the ICM fission This has been documented through
the time lapse imaging The quality of the culture media
is also thought to stimulate zygotic splitting An increase in
the free radicals concentration due to increased glucose con
centration in the culture media used for prolonged culture
could lead to ICM splitting at the site of glucose induced
apoptosis of certain regions of the ICM The new sequential
culture systems with antioxidant activity might explain the
lack of increase of the rate of embryo splitting despite the
major increase in the number of IVF cycles and embryo
transfers worldwide When coupled with the improvement
in the embryologists training and experience the rate of
splitting associated with a blastocyst transfer has been found
to decrease The OR for embryo splitting decreased
from to when comparing the periods of to
and to Embryo biopsy on the other
hand was not found to increase the risk of embryo splitting
contrary to what was believed before
Suggested Mechanisms of Division
It has been shown that blastomeres from a cell stage
embryo can develop into an ICM and trophectoderm hence
any division after this stage could give rise to or more
embryos with an implantation potential Of the sug
gested mechanisms abnormal cellular axis formation and
cytoplasm folding in the secondary oocyte prior to fertiliza
tion or during the actual fertilization lead to duplication It is
speculated that gonadotropin stimulation might disrupt the
fine balance and gradients of signalling molecules affecting
the polarity of the oocyte This is thought to lead to the for
mation of cells referred to as daughter cells or tertiary
oocytes that could be fertilized This is speculated to be
caused by the displacement of the meiotic spindle due to
oocyte aging postovulation This disruption might lead to
the duplication of the axes and formation of embryos upon
fertilization or the fission of the ICM into at the blastocyst
stage This theory would be replaced later on by the for
mation of zygotes postfertilization of the secondary oocyte
and not blastomeres Other studies advocated the fis
Sion to happen closer to the cleavage stage and thus the
sequence of events happening during hatching would then
explain the type of the twin gestation If both blastocysts
were released at the same time then the resultant pregnancy
would be a dichorionic diamniotic twin gestation If on the
other hand the blastocysts fused with the conservation of
separate ICMs prior to hatching then monochorionic
diamniotic twins would appear If complete fusion of the
trophectoderm and the ICM happened then monochorionic
monoamniotic twins would be created Another
suggestion was that the ICM would split due to mechanical
compression during hatching through the manipulated zona
pellucida of the embryo which is also referred to as atypical
hatching This atypical hatching is referred to as
Journal of Pregnancy
shaped hatching which usually takes place when the
embryo is squeezing out through the hatch of the hardened
zona pellucida due to prolonged culture to blastocyst stage
and in cryopreserved thawed blastocysts especially with the
application of the day prehatching protocol It is
speculated that this phenomenon might also be the culprit
for the monozygotic triplet gestations that have been docu
mented post SET Another possible explanation to dual
or even more ICM is the nature of human blastomere
plasticity Studies have shown that isolated trophectoderm
cells when cultivated could give rise to a whole new embryo
with an implantation potential As such if a blastomere
gets separated from the trophectoderm into the blastocele
due to low grade compaction of the trophectoderm this
blastomere could give rise to an ICM Theoretically each
ICM should give rise to a separate fetus with the surround
ing amnion while the chorion develops during the implanta
tion The mechanism of chorionic differentiation between
mono and higher order chorionicity in monozygotic preg
nancies is still unknown
Triplets Possible Explanation
The explanation of embryo splitting into three is challenging
since triplets after SET is a very rare event What is known so
far is that to have implantation an embryo with an intact
ICM should be present The number of the ICM that the
embryo has will define the number of fetuses that will be
seen on the pregnancy ultrasound The chorionicity of the
pregnancy will depend on the number of zygotes present at
the time of implantation In theory the chorion should rise
from trophectoderm cells thus it would be logical to con
sider that the higher the order of the chorionicity the higher
the number of separate embryos available for implantation
In the setting of monochorionic triplets it is believed that
the blastocyst harbors three distinct ICMs The mechanism
of their creation might be similar to the ones suggested for
the monochorionic twin gestation The trigger factor for
the splitting into and not into is still unknown In the set
ting of the multichorionic triplets a suggested explanation
might be the complete division of the hatching embryos
resulting in and not only fully hatched embryo Another
possible explanation for this is if the origin of the sister ICMs
is a trophectoderm blastomere Since the implantation
potential of reconstructed embryos cannot be tested at this
point due to ethical reasons one can only postulate that such
cellular plasticity might confer to the newly formed ICM the
whole genetic makeup necessary for a successful implanta
tion and healthy fetal development
The question that arises here is that whether the embryo
initially had multiple ICM followed by trophectoderm split
ting upon hatching or the splitting of the ICM took place
during hatching due to the mechanical pressure exerted by
the hardened zona pellucida The latter might explain the
high incidence of blighted ova in triplet pregnancies Due
to the abnorma
