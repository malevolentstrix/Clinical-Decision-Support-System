quantity quality trade off and resource dilution hypothesis as a plau
Sible mechanism driving our main results Thus we show that an
exogenous increase in the number of children is detrimental to their
nutritional status making the case for family planning stronger in af

hypothesis for the case of India
Conclusion
Child malnutrition is currently one of the most critical public health
issues in India with an alarmingly high proportion of children wasted
stunted and or underweight Media reports and researchers suggest
that India is slipping into a vicious cycle of malnourishment Despite
several efforts by the government under the umbrella of the National
Food Security Act which aims to target and significantly reduce child
malnutrition through Integrated Child Development Services ICDS
and Mid Day Meal Scheme MDMS India continues to grapple with
poor child health In light of this we assert that it is important to
understand other causes and channels that affect child health In this
paper we examine one such determinant of children s nutritional sta
tus Specifically utilizing the latest round of the NFHS we study the
causal effects of parents family planning practices that is their use
of contraception on children s anthropometric measures of nutritional
surveillance
By exploring the exogenous variation in the district average expo
sure of women to family planning messages through mass media we
find a positive impact of a couple s choice to use contraception on
children s nutritional statuses Having controlled for a comprehensive
set of controls as well as state fixed effects we provide robust evidence
that contraceptive use leads to a SD increase in a child s HAZ and
a SD increase in her WAZ In order to provide more context to our
results we compare and benchmark our estimates against other recent
work examining various factors impacting child health indicators We
find that our effects are in line with some of these findings For
example
shows that compulsory primary education
of mothers in Turkey results in an increase of HAZ WAZ by
SD respectively and
Chen
finds that having more than
children in violation of Vietnam s two child policy reduces HAZ WAZ
in year old children by SD respectively
Further we document interesting heterogeneous effects in that we
find larger effects on a female child s HAZ and WAZ for poor families
and those residing in rural areas for both HAZ and WAZ Beyond this
we also note some noteworthy effects of contraceptive use on the mea
sures of children s stunting and underweight indicators Specifically
the probability of being moderately or acutely stunted underweight
reduces by pp pp as a result of the parent s reproductive
practices Our results hold across individual child level data as well
as for the analysis conducted at the household level The results are
also robust to the inclusion of additional district level characteristics
Moreover we document that a couple s reproductive practices have a
causal effect on child nutrition using data from the previous survey
For a given family size lengthening birth intervals may be another poten
tial channel for positive effects on child health Exploring this channel further
while there is evidence that a couple s use of contraception is positively related
with length of preceding birth intervals we do not find any evidence of birth
spacing affecting children s anthropometric measures As such we are inclined
to rule out this channel as a potential mechanism in our case
As robustness we also utilize the district average of women s exposure
to family planning messages through mass media as an IV for household size
given that contraception use limits household size is widely established in the
literature and as such highly correlated with each other The negative effect of
an increase in household size on a child s HAZ and WAZ score remains robust
to this change in IV The results are provided in Appendix of the paper
Economic Modelling
wave of NFHS This result ought to be important for development
practitioners and policymakers given that the use of contraceptives by
the parents consistently appears vital in determining children s health
outcomes
We also examine a potential channel through which we could be
capturing the effect of contraceptive use on a child s nutritional indica
tors We provide evidence in support of the quantity quality trade off
indicating that with family planning measures and consequently fewer
children parents are more effectively able to invest resources towards
existing children We note that a truly exogenous increase in household
size does in fact lead to a decline in the nutritional indicators of
children for our sample
Nevertheless our findings must be read with a few caveats First
while our paper finds robust evidence that contraception leads to a
positive effect on child health our main variable of interest is an indi
cator of whether the couple has ever used contraception Information
on when the couple has used contraception or which pregnancy the
use of contraceptives has tried to affect delay may have led to a richer
analysis However it is impossible to identify this record from the
NFHS data To address this to some extent we provide an aggregate
household level analysis Second lengthening of birth intervals for a
given family size could be another potential channel of our effects
Longer birth intervals are known to improve child health outcomes
as evidenced in the literature
Molitoris Miller et al
Conde Agudelo et al Yeakey et al We find evidence
that contraception is highly correlated with a couple s choice of spacing
births and as such attempt to explore this channel in the paper Using
the information available in NFHS data we see a positive effect of using
contraception on the length of preceding birth intervals but the effect
of birth spacing on the anthropometric measures of child health is not
statistically significant perhaps on account of noisy data for preceding
and succeeding birth spacing As such we do not find enough evidence
to establish this as a plausible channel Third given the structure of the
NFHS data the respondent for the child level and individual questions
is the mother woman of the household We believe that children s nu
tritional status would also be impacted by their father s characteristics
However only a smaller sample of men were interviewed for a short
couple s survey in the data and including those variables results in the
loss of a large amount of critical information at the woman and child
level Hence in our analysis following the extant literature we utilize
mother child and household characteristics although incorporating the
father s characteristics would make the analysis more refined
Considering that better nutritional outcomes for children eventually
leads to better human capital accumulation improved productivity
and reduced healthcare costs we underline the importance of family
planning measures in tackling child ill health We assert that this has
important implications from a policy viewpoint While better sanita
tion food security and maternal healthcare have been examined as
important determinants of child health in the literature our paper calls
for greater focus on family planning measures specifically through
the encouragement of contraceptive use for improved child nutritional
status in a country riddled with both high populations as well as the
triple burden of child malnutrition Our findings also indicate that if
anything these family planning measures have greater positive effects
on children from backward castes poorer households and those resid
ing in rural areas Therefore it may be important to channel greater
efforts towards these groups to reap sizeable benefits for children s
health outcomes

combination of two adverse developmental
exposures or second hits has been widely
investigated previously e g combination
of poor diet and physical inactivity how
the effects of natural disasters and global
health crises combine to impact maternal
child health remains unclear
Pregnancy is a critical window in human
development as the fetus is particularly
vulnerable to external exposures result
ing in lifelong adverse consequences for
the offspring s health In this context
wildfires extreme heat and smoke expo
sure have been identified as an environ
mental exposure that is associated with
detrimental pregnancy and child health
outcomes Prenatal exposure to wildfires
has been linked to abnormal birth weight
and heightened rates of prematurity
gestational diabetes and hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy Similarly the
COVID pandemic has been shown
to increase maternal mortality ruptured
ectopic pregnancies stillbirth and ma
ternal depression Furthermore we
increasingly recognize that COVID is
disproportionately impacting women
and babies worldwide not only due to
infections with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV

and child health services It may
therefore be expected that women who

Potential mechanisms underlying
synergism in effects of wildfires
and COVID on maternal and
child metabolic health
In this section we elaborate on the knowl
edge gaps on mechanisms by which wild
fires and the COVID pandemic may
have synergistic detrimental effects on
maternal child metabolic health We pro
pose that the synergism is a consequence
of overlapping and interconnected mech
anisms mediated by indirect effects on life
style individual and family psychological
stress and social cohesion that are com
mon to the two crises Figure These in
direct effects then amplify the overall
response by compounding the previously
reported direct toxic effects of wildfire

SARS CoV infection on the pregnant
mother
including immune system
changes oxidative stress and abnormal
placental morphology and function
The placenta may have an important role
in protecting the fetus in such circum
stances which may explain the low rates
of vertical SARS CoV transmission
However its capacity to protect may be
reduced with cumulative insults as is
more likely in syndemics
Wildfires and COVID are known to in

abuse and mood all of which have
consequences for health and metabolism

Box Timing is key
The temporal order of crises and triggered mechanisms is critical
Trends in Endocrinology Metabolism
In syndemic research it is essential to consider he order in which crises A B and resulting mechanisms
occurred as crisis A could exacerbate or reduce he impact of crisis B on maternal child health outcomes
For example natural disas ers increase psychological distress which could dampen maternal
immune response during COVID ernatively COVID increased communi y solidarity and
resilience which could facilitate community engagement and decrease individual distress during a
wildfire evacuation
During pregnancy and development the concept of critical window is well es ablished When a particular
disaster crisis perturbs these cri cal windows it determines the impact of that event on maternal and child
health For example crisis occurrence in pregnancy could affect fetal organ development while postnatally
it could affec breastfeed ng
Hence the temporal order should be given pivotal consideration to appropriately assess the
consequences of syndemcs on maternal child health

Concluding remarks
A healthy start to life from the prenatal to the
neonatal period is critical for achieving opti
mal long term metabolic health for mothers

healthy start to life it is essential that our

Advanced maternal age and risk perception A
qualitative study
Hamideh Bayrampour Maureen Heaman Karen A Duncan and Suzanne Tough
Abstract
Background Advanced maternal age AMA is associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes hence these
pregnancies are considered to be high risk A review of the empirical literature suggests that it is not clear how
women of AMA evaluate their pregnancy risk This study aimed to address this gap by exploring the risk perception
of pregnant women of AMA
Methods A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to obtain a rich and detailed source of explanatory data
regarding perceived pregnancy risk of women of AMA The sample was recruited from a variety of settings in
Winnipeg Canada In depth interviews were conducted with nulliparous women aged years or older in their
third trimester and with singleton pregnancies Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and content
analysis was used to identify themes and categories
Results Four main themes emerged definition of pregnancy risk factors influencing risk perception risk alleviation
strategies and risk communication with health professionals
Conclusions Several factors may influence women s perception of pregnancy risk including medical risk
psychological elements characteristics of the risk stage of pregnancy and health care provider s opinion
Understanding these influential factors may help health professionals who care for pregnant women of AMA to
gain insight into their perspectives on pregnancy risk and improve the effectiveness of risk communication
strategies with this group
Keywords Advanced maternal age Risk perception Qualitative study
Background
In the past three decades an increasing proportion of
women have delayed childbearing for educational social
and economic reasons Pregnancy at advanced ma
ternal age AMA defined as age years or older is
associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes in
cluding preterm birth low birth weight still birth
chromosomal defects labor complications and cesarean
section therefore it is considered to be a high
risk pregnancy However little is known about how
women of AMA perceive their pregnancy risk Under
standing perception of pregnancy risk is important be
cause it can affect women s health care use motivations

Risk perception is also incorporated as a key con
cept in constructing several theories of health behavior
such as the Health Belief Model Protection Motiv
ation Theory and Prospect Theory
The concept of risk at AMA may be composed of two
components the physiological challenges because of an
aging reproductive system and the social discourse of
risk and timing of childbearing Most previous work
on risk perception at AMA has focused on increased
risk of genetic abnormalities and the general concept of
pregnancy risk perception has received less consider
ation Current knowledge of risk perception at AMA is
based on a few studies that most of them primarily fo
cused on pregnancy experiences in which risk percep
tion was discussed as part of the pregnancy and birth
experience For instance Windridge and Berryman

in a study of British women s experiences of
giving birth at AMA explored risk perception and
reported that women of AMA may perceive a higher risk
for their babies during labor because of their older age
Another notable study on this topic is an Austra
lian qualitative study of prim gravid women of AMA
that was initially conducted to understand the experi
ences of women of AMA Later in Carolan
and Nelson conducted a secondary analysis of the quali
tative data and identified four themes central to percep
tion of pregnancy risk including realizing I was at risk
hoping for reassurance dealing with uncertainty and
getting through it negotiating risk p They
reported high levels of concern and anxiety among parti
cipants in spite of these women having healthy pregnan
cies and concluded that the notion of risk may have
negative impacts on these women A qualitative study by
Saxell primarily focused on studying the under
standings and beliefs about the risks associated with the
pregnancies of ten women of AMA Saxell reported that
these women found being labeled as high risk very chal
lenging hence several participants rejected this labeling
as part of their coping mechanism This study had a
number of limitations such as retrospective data collec
tion months after delivery and its unique population
participants who chose midwifery care which should
be considered in the interpretation of the results
The focus of previous studies has been on describing
the impact of being labeled as high risk on pregnant
women rather than exploring and elaborating on the
process of risk appraisal by these women Understanding
women s perception of pregnancy risk is essential in devel
oping more effective risk communication approaches
Considering the lack of literature in this area and limita
tions associated with previous studies we conducted a
mixed methods research study to further existing know
ledge on risk perception and its contributing factors
Mixed methods research is research in which the inves
tigator collects and analyzes data integrates the findings
and draws inferences using both qualitative and quantita
tive approaches or methods in a single study or a pro
gram of inquiry p Mixed methods research gives
the researcher an ability to use both numbers and words
and combine inductive and deductive thinking to address
the research problem Our study was composed of
both qualitative and quantitative components and using
a mixed methods approach we compared or integrated
the factors contributing to perception of pregnancy risk
determined by multiple regression analyses with the
women s perspectives obtained from qualitative inter
views to enhance current knowledge on this topic The
sample for the mixed methods study consisted of
participants women aged years and
women aged years or older In the quantitative
Page of
component we compared perception of pregnancy risk
in nulliparous women aged years or older n
with that of nulliparous women aged years
n In the quantitative component we also
developed a conceptual framework to explore factors
contributing to risk perception among nulliparous
women N The study reported here is the
qualitative component of this mixed methods study The
objectives of this qualitative study were to explore how
nulliparous women of AMA evaluate and define their
pregnancy risk and to arrive at a detailed understanding
of their risk perception The following research questions
were explored How do nulliparous women of AMA
define pregnancy risk Why do women of AMA feel
that their pregnancy is or is not at risk Which factors
influence perception of pregnancy risk What impact
if any did being labeled high risk have on these women s
lives and behaviors What are the experiences of
women of AMA with risk communication from health
care providers during pregnancy How do women feel
their perceptions of risk differ from those of their health
care providers if at all
Methods
A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to obtain
a rich and detailed source of explanatory data regarding
risk perception from women of AMA As described by
Sandelowski a qualitative descriptive study pro
vides a comprehensive summary of an event in the
everyday terms of those events p The qualita
tive descriptive method is a distinctive and valuable
technique and offers a direct description of phenomena
which is still interpretive As Sandelowski
stated this kind of research can address both descriptive
and interpretive validity to account for participants
observations and their understandings of these events
Participants were chosen purposefully from among the
participants in the quantitative component of the mixed
methods study Criteria for participation in the larger
mixed methods study were women with a singleton
pregnancy ability to speak read and write English and
gestational age of weeks or greater Any known se
vere psychological disorder was an exclusion criterion
Data were collected over months from December
to January from selected physicians offices
and outpatient prenatal care clinics at two tertiary hospi
tals in Winnipeg Manitoba
In purposeful sampling participants are intentionally
selected according to the needs of the study The
researcher asked selected women aged years or older
who had participated in the quantitative component of
the study if they were willing to participate in the quali
tative component Participants were selected to ensure
diversity in demographic and obstetric characteristics

most notably gestational age and pregnancy complica
tions In addition participants were recruited to reflect a
range of scores using the Perception of Pregnancy Risk
Questionnaire used in the quantitative component
to ensure inclusion of participants with different levels
of perception of pregnancy risk
Potential participants were provided with a written
and verbal explanation of the study Each participant
signed a consent form A mutually convenient time and
place were arranged to conduct the interviews In depth
semi structured face to face interviews using an inter
view guide were conducted by the researcher from Janu
ary to January The interview guide was
developed by the investigators and key areas explored
included decision making about timing of childbearing
women s understandings about pregnancy after age
perceived pregnancy risk and its impact on woman s
feelings and thoughts partner s perspectives about preg
nancy and women s experiences with the health care
system All interviews were audio recorded and tran
scribed verbatim In qualitative inquiry sample size re
lies on the concept of saturation which is the point at
which no new information or themes are observed in
the data Saturation was reached after interviewing
participants
Data analysis was carried out concurrently with data
collection Transcripts were analyzed using a content
analysis technique Content analysis is a systematic
and replicable method used for condensing many words
of text into fewer content categories based on explicit
rules of coding As mentioned earlier this study was
part of a mixed methods research study in which several
instruments were administered to women participating
in the quantitative component In this report select
