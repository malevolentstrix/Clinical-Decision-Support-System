Methods
Study Design
This was a secondary analysis of data from the Future of
Families and Child Wellbeing FFCWB study an ongoing na
tional birth cohort study from large U S cities
Reichman et al Leveraging a longitudinal cohort dataset
as has been done with similar research questions Anyigbo
Jimenez Sosnowski Dauner Wilmot Schultz
we account for temporal ordering by measuring childcare pre
carity at a developmentally appropriate earlier time point before
subsequent maternal health outcomes of interest Specifically to
test the hypothesis of whether childcare precarity experiences
when children were age have associations with maternal
health outcomes when children are age a lag of approximately
years we estimated regression models with conservative
robust standard errors In these models we adjusted for relevant
covariates selected using a comprehensive directed acyclic graph
informed by important baseline covariates related to the FFCWB
sampling design as well as a careful review of childcare studies

Participants
The FFCWB study oversampled nonmarital births a
population at increased risk to be at a lower socioeconomic
status and with decreased access to social support Liang Berger
Brand Solomon Fears The original cohort study
included children largely from socioeconomically disad
vantaged groups Study staff interviewed parents shortly after
giving birth baseline then re interviewed parents when chil
dren were and years old Our secondary analysis included
self identified mothers who were primary caregivers for the
focal child with complete longitudinal data for our variables

Measures
Childcare Precarity Measures When the Child Was Age
To conceptualize our main predictor we first referenced prior
work examining childcare instability which describes child
health outcomes associated with unstable fluctuating or mul
tiple childcare arrangements Our interest was in capturing the
adjoining but distinct maternal experience of childcare pre
carity or feelings of uncertainty lack of predictability and
insecurity a concept informed by an interdisciplinary review of
literature describing similar experiences of job and economic
precarity
Luhr et al North Parolin Lee We
used three assessments of childcare precarity with increasing
severity measured when children were at age These questions
were only asked of parents of children in regular childcare
defined in the FFCWB study as being cared for by someone other
than a mother or father on a regular basis for or more hours a
week
Insecure childcare This question captures childcare that fell
through leaving the participant to scramble for backup childcare
arrangements The survey asked Approximately how many
times in the past month did you have to make special arrange
ments because your usual childcare arrangement fell through
Participants who reported this experience at least once were
coded as having insecure childcare The FFCWB did not collect
information on the circumstances for which childcare fell
through such as a parent s subjective decision to keep a child
home owing to
unreliability

participant missing a day of work or training The survey asked
How many times in the past month did you miss work or school
because your childcare arrangement fell through Participants
who reported this experience at least once were coded as having
insecure childcare with missed work
Inadequate childcare This question captures the highest level of
childcare severity assessing whether or not childcare precarity
resulted in interruption or suspension of the participant s pro
fessional trajectory The survey asked participants whether since
their child was age Have you had to quit a job school or
training activity because you had problems arranging childcare
or keeping a childcare arrangement Participants who respon
ded yes were coded as having had inadequate childcare
Access to Emergency Childcare Support When the Child Was
Years Old
To assess emergency childcare support we used a question
that captures access to emergency childcare support from
informal sources If you needed help during the next year could
you count on someone to help you with emergency child care
If the participant replied yes they were coded as having emer
gency childcare support This question asked of all participants
regardless of whether the child was in childcare is part of a
larger question set in the FFCWB measuring perceived social
support e g someone to count on for a loan which has
been consistently associated with positive health outcomes
Dauner et al Delaney
Reliable childcare is most relevant for parents who are
working or in school but emergency childcare support has been
shown to be a key component of a parental safety net Harknett
Knab Harknett Hartnett Thus when examining
associations with maternal health outcomes when children were
age we assessed emergency childcare support in all families as
well as in a subset of participants who ever worked when their
children were ages or Given that access to emergency
childcare support could mitigate childcare precarity we also
explored whether emergency childcare support had a buffering
interaction with childcare precarity i e whether it reduced the
magnitude of association between childcare precarity and
maternal health
Maternal Health Measures When the Child Was Age
Poor Fair Overall Maternal Health
This measure captures self reported health which studies
have established to be a valid health status indicator for adult
population health monitoring to reflect physical health health
care use and mortality McGee et al Miilunpalo et al
The survey asked In general how is your health Par
ticipants could respond excellent very good good fair
or poor Per prior work McGee et al Miilunpalo et al
we dichotomized overall health at the cutpoint of poor
fair versus all others and ran sensitivity analyses using a cutpoint
of excellent versus all others This same measure was also
assessed in participants when children were age which we
used as a covariate in certain models
Maternal Depression
Maternal depression was derived from the Composite Inter
national Diagnostic Interview a comprehensive fully structured
interview assessing International Classification of Diseases
edition and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
IVth edition mental health criteria administered by trained in
terviewers Kessler et al The FFCWB uses the short form
which includes Composite International Diagnostic Interview
questions about the prior months Examples of symptoms
surveyed include losing interest weight changes trouble
sleeping or concentrating feeling worthless and thinking about
death The FFCWB user guide Fragile families and child wellbeing
study n d recommends two scoring methods based on symp
tom duration For our main analyses we used the liberal
scoring which is more sensitive for depression score
positive for depression with this scoring and we conducted
sensitivity analyses using conservative scoring which is more
specific score positive for depression with this scoring
Fragile families and child wellbeing study n d
Maternal
depression was also assessed when children were age and we
used the short form scoring as a covariate in certain models
Maternal Parenting Stress
This measure captures stress triggered by child rearing tasks
FFCWB used questions derived from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics and the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training
Program Survey McGonagle et al Participants responded
on a point Likert scale e g not at all true completely true
to statements such as Being a parent is harder than I thought it
would be or I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent In
line with prior work we reverse coded the items and summed
the items so that higher scores represented higher levels of
agreement with parenting stress statements Cooper et al
We ran sensitivity analyses using the alter

nate parenting stress scoring method which averages the scores
from each statement Fragile families and child wellbeing study

stress when children were age which was assessed with the
same measure but not collected for two of the FFCWB cities at
that time point
Covariates
We tested all factors for multicollinearity by assessing vari
ance inflation factors before inclusion in our model Maternal
baseline characteristics measured at birth included maternal
age years race and ethnicity non Hispanic white non
Hispanic Black Hispanic other education level less than high
school high school graduate some college college graduate
family structure married cohabiting parents in a relationship
but not cohabiting no relationship and income as a percentage
of the federal poverty level
or higher Child baseline characteristics included
assigned sex at birth first born and multiple birth status
Covariates at other timepoints included whether participants
ever worked or were in school when their children were age or
before age yes no Prior work has also shown that the use of
childcare centers over individual caregivers led to work absences
owing to child illnesses so we adjusted for childcare center use
as well the number of childcare arrangements concurrently used
when their children were at age to proxy for childcare insta
bility
Gordon et al
As per prior relevant research we controlled for child
temperament at age using the mean of the Emotionality Ac
tivity and Sociability Temperament Survey
Pilarz Hill
with higher scores indicating negative emotionality and shyness
This covariate helped to account for child level time invariant
differences that may contribute to both childcare precarity ex
periences and maternal health
Finally as has been done in prior work Hedges et al
we ran an additional model that adjusted for the corresponding
maternal health outcome measure when their children were age
before age childcare exposures to account for time invariant
maternal health characteristics at baseline in an effort to isolate
our estimates to what occurred when their children were be
tween ages and only
Statistical Analysis
We used Stata SE version Stata Corp College Station TX
to conduct all analyses To preserve sample size we did not use
FFCWB weights so that we could include all families with com
plete longitudinal data
We first summarized child maternal and childcare charac
teristics Using unadjusted or independent sample t tests as
appropriate we tested for statistically significant differences
between the sample in and not in regular childcare For our
primary study question we used logistic and linear regressions
as appropriate to estimate adjusted regression models of asso
ciations between childcare precarity when children were age
and maternal health outcomes when children were age Model
controlled for maternal child and childcare characteristics
Model added the corresponding maternal health outcome
measure when children were age before age childcare ex
posures We used robust standard errors to account conserva
tively for potential bias in estimates We presented estimates as
odds ratios ORS or unstandardized linear regression co
efficients Bs with confidence intervals CIS
To characterize persistent childcare precarity or support across
child ages and we categorized the variables as never no at
both ages and the reference group age only yes at age no
at age age only no at age yes at age and both time points
yes at both ages and and estimated adjusted logistic and
linear regression models to examine associations between
persistent early childcare precarity or emergency childcare sup
port and maternal health outcomes when children were age We
ran these analyses using covariates from model to maximizes
cases given that the corresponding parenting stress variable was
not measured in all cities when children were age and we ran
sensitivity analyses using covariates from model
To assess cross sectional relationships when children were
age we conducted supplemental analyses examining associa
tions between childcare measures and maternal health out
comes both measured when children were age We also
examined associations between childcare measures when chil
dren were age and maternal health outcomes when children
were age Supplemental analyses used model covariates
Results
The overall sample included participants of those
participants had children in regular childcare
Table The majority of the sample had a minoritized back
ground almost one half self identified as Black almost
one quarter as Hispanic and less than one quarter
as white There were subgroup differences across socio
demographics between those whose children were in and not in
regular childcare Participants with children in regular childcare
were more likely to be Black vs less likely to be
Hispanic vs and more likely to have higher levels of
education and income This group was also more likely to not live
with a partner i e less likely to be married vs less
likely to be cohabiting vs
In the subsample of those with children in childcare more
than one quarter had insecure childcare had
insecure childcare with missed work and had inadequate

Discussion
In a national U S birth cohort from large cities we found
significant and robust associations between early childcare pre
carity and maternal health outcomes approximately years later
which have not been described before These findings suggest
that policies to increase access to reliable secure childcare and
emergency childcare supports could improve the health of
mothers of young children We categorized levels of childcare
precarity i e insecure insecure with missed work inadequate
as often is done for food insecurity e g food insecure food
insecure with hunger Blumberg et al This categoriza
tion which acknowledges that families experience varying levels
of hardship also demonstrates that increased severity may be
associated with poorer health outcomes and indicates that
childcare precarity is a social determinant of women s health
Our finding that early inadequate childcare was associated
with increased odds of poor fair maternal health later on extends
literature showing associations between other experiences of
social determinants of health and poorer overall health e g food
insecurity

access to emergency childcare support had protective and ad
ditive effects on overall health later on participants with
emergency childcare support when children were both ages
and had one half the odds of poor fair health compared with
participants who had no emergency childcare support when
children were either age To our knowledge this is one of the first
studies to find associations between childcare experiences with
long term overall maternal health and it suggests future studies
should elucidate potential pathways from experiencing childcare
precarity to potentially curtailing work or training reducing in
come increasing stress and compromising overall women s
health Chatterji Markowitz Brooks Gunn
All childcare precarity measures we considered were associ
ated with subsequent maternal depression Maternal depression
is a common chronic source of disability that is also likely a
vehicle for the intergenerational transmission of poverty related
toxic stress Letourneau et al Schor Wachs Black
A prior study found associations between percep
Engle
tions of stable childcare access and decreased odds of maternal
depression when children were preschool aged but not between
an increased number of childcare arrangements and concurrent
maternal depression
Johnson Padilla Our findings
reinforce that it is the participant s experiences of childcare
precarity rather than the actual arrangement which may reflect
maternal cultural and personal preferences that likely
contribute to maternal depression Our findings also suggest that
the most notable associations with childcare precarity may be
long term in the setting of persistent experiences of managing
conflicts between work and family Supplemental analyses
showed that experiences of inadequate childcare starting when
children were age were associated with maternal depression
when children were age showing potentially enduring effects
of childcare precarity on maternal mental health Future studies
should elucidate vulnerable stages of parenthood when systemic
efforts to deliver childcare support may optimize long term
maternal mental health
Although depression captures overall feelings of dysphoria or
anhedonia parenting stress stems specifically from parenting
e g l feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent Although
we found strong associations between early childcare precarity
and later maternal depression associations with parenting stress
were less consistent Early insecure and inadequate childcare but
not insecure childcare with missed work had associations with
parenting stress scores none of these estimates were significant
after adjusting for parenting stress at year Our measure of
parenting stress was not available for two of the FFCWB cities
when children were age which potentially limited our ability to
detect associations in those models However this finding is
consistent with prior research showing that associations be
tween childcare precarity and parenting stress do not hold up
when adjusting for prior stress perhaps because participants
experiencing stress to begin with are also more likely to expe
rience childcare precarity
In supplemental
Pilarz Hill
analyses we found that all experiences of childcare precarity
were associated with parenting stress concurrently when chil
dren were age which may indicate that parenting stress may
dissipate over time as concentrated childcare needs decrease
The ability to follow families more intensely and reevaluate
childcare supports at various stages may yield valuable infor
mation on the extent of childcare supports needed across
childhood informing interventions to optimize family health
We found that emergency childcare support had favorable
associations with all subsequent maternal health outcomes in
the full sample These findings reinforce an accumulating body of
evidence showing that access to social support is a matter of
public health
Participants parenting on their
Balaji et al
own who made up the majority of our sample may also
particularly benefit from robust social support networks How
ever as reflected in the regular childcare sample where associ
ations were similar in direction and magnitude but no longer
significant access to emergency childcare may be helpful as a
short term solution but not an adequate substitute for ongoing
reliable childcare essential for a parent to successfully engage in
employment or training The sample who ever worked when
children were ages and the vast majority did show
benefits from emergency childcare support suggesting that the
presence of this informal safety net does likely benefit most
participants who are attempting to work or go to school We did
not detect statistical interaction when exploring whether
emergency childcare support buffered the effects of childcare
precarity However future studies should consider intentionally
powering their samples to examine additional subgroup ana
lyses by income race or types of social support specifically as a
strength based approach
Limitations include study design sampling unmeasured
variable bias and loss to follow up The FFCWB is a prospective
observational study and causality cannot be established The
FFCWB also oversampled nonmarital births with the intention of
generating data on an understudied socioeconomically disad
vantaged population Yet childcare precarity likely has health
impacts across socioeconomic strata as highlighted in parenting
studies during the COVID pandemic Petts et al In
analyses examining childcare experiences across timepoints
when children were ages and a few of the subgroups were
below participants and estimates were less precise with large
CIS These analyses were likely underpowered to detect associ
ations for mothers experiencing precarity consistently when
their children were ages and In light of limited U S data
available to study long term outcomes of childcare precarity
new prospective studies involving larger and more diverse co
horts are needed FFCWB also only asks about childcare precarity
for children regularly cared for by someone else at the time of the
survey omitting participants who may have used regular care in
early childhood but not at the time of the survey Although we
were able to examine the effects of emergency childcare support
on all participants experiences of childcare precarity were only
assessed in participants who had children in regular childcare at
the time The FFCWB also did not include information on why
childcare fell through which may depend on subjective parental
judgment e g mild illnesses rather than provider reliability
However our decision to control for childcare type or child
temperament may have tempered this potential bias Finally loss
to follow up is also a limitation although our overall sample
characteristics are similar to the FFCWB baseline suggesting
minimal bias owing to attrition
Implications for Policy and or Practice
Overall our study findings leverage a life course framework to
suggest that experiences of early childcare precarity may be
followed by persistent or even mounting adverse maternal
health associations over time Findings from this study support
primary care efforts to screen for childcare precarity Chung
et al Sokol et al as well as integration of
maternal child health care system linkages to harmonize access
to child and maternal community and health resources

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective We sought to understand BRCA previvors perceptions of communication with genetic counselors and other
healthcare providers
Methods We conducted qualitative interviews and utilized thematic analysis to develop patterns present in the nar
ratives of previvors
Results Interviews with previvors suggest genetic counselors and other providers often make assumptions about
previvors family planning and treatrnent needs based on perceived gender age and sexual orientation
Conclusioru BRCA patients require individualized attention when planning for their future and making healthcare de
cisions and we argue that implementing patient centered care practices into the communication process can provide a
higher quality of care
Innovatioru This study offers an innovative lens through which scholars and healthcare providers may examine the ex
periences of BRCA previvors as they seek adequate care Asking previvors to explain their perceptions of conversations
with genetic counselors and healthcare providers offers insight into the communicative process of seeking care rather
than the health outcomes of the care itself Our findings suggest biases among providers related to gender age and
sexual orientation are concerning elements of family planning communication that potentially interrupt previvors
abilities to express their care needs in a safe environment We argue for an increased awareness of and advocacy
for more inclusive conversations regarding treatrnent and family planning decisions
Individuals found to carry a pathogenic variant in the genes BRCAI
sometimes referred to as previvors often meet with numerous healthcare
providers including genetic counselors gynecologists and oncologists
throughout their journey They rely on these and other sources to learn
more about their genetic mutation family planning and fertility options
and treatment possibilities which largely include surveillance and surgery
Research on communication between genetic counselors and BRCA previvors
is growing yet still provides opportunities for exploration A much larger
body of research has explored the communication between genetic coun
selors and individuals who have received a cancer diagnosis or are receiving
treatments including a scoping review published in highlighting
the need to study the communication process in genetic counseling more
deeply Prior literature suggests genetic counseling tends to focus on biomed
ical information rather than psychological support of patients In addition
patients needs for personalized information regarding their diagnosis family
dynamics and treatment options may not always be met by genetic

counselors In a study of breast and ovarian cancer patients Jacobs and
colleagues argued that research is needed to better understand communi
cation by oncology professionals including genetic counselors
We begin to answer this call and extend agency to previvors with an
exploratory study investigating BRCA previvors and their experiences
with genetic counselors and other members of their healthcare team
BRCA previvors along with most precision medicine patients have specific
needs when meeting with genetic counselors and other providers Sharing
previvors experiences with healthcare providers like genetic counselors
gynecologists and oncologists through qualitative interviews such as
those used in this study can help educate scholars healthcare providers
genetic counselors and professionals and policymakers on how to improve
engagement with this growing population

BRCA previvors including an increased focus on patient centered care and
communication Patient centered care is designed to manage the con
cerns many scholars have noted are central to the previvor experience like
uncertainty information exchange emotional well being and self
management In a recent article on enhancing patient centered
care within precision oncology Chou and her colleagues note commu
nication is critical for those being genetically tested for hereditary breast
and ovarian cancer Such patients are often struggling with feelings of un
certainty in understanding their diagnosis and in making decisions
based on their results Genetic counselors and other providers can help pa
tients manage their uncertainty by addressing their specific care prefer
ences as well as concerns like financial insecurity misinformation and
the possibility of changing treatment modalities when necessary
There are documented psychological impacts of genetic testing for BRCA
patients and patient centered care and communication is critical
to ensure previvors needs are met
In a qualitative study of BRCA previvors experiences with genetic test
ing and treatment planning Hesse Biber found previvors did not make
decisions specifically based on statistical data provided by their genetic
counselor Instead they filtered those data through a broader lens of per
sonal experiences and preferences Genetic counselors must understand
those personal preferences to offer the highest quality of care for previvors
Patient centered care within precision medicine and genetic testing as de
scribed by Arora and colleagues needs to take a whole person approach
rather than focusing on the patient s genes alone
While important most prior scholarship has analyzed quantitative com
munication outcomes such as patients uncertainty anxiety and stress after
communicating with counselors rather than the communication process it
self Qualitative studies are needed to analyze perceptions of the process
of communication in visits between BRCA previvors genetic counselors
and other providers on their healthcare teams to ensure the highest quality
care throughout the previvor journey that is meeting the needs of previvors
Family planning for BRCA previvors
Precision medicine and genetic testing for BRCA previvors has many
benefits but requires strong communication between patients and providers
particularly around patients personal and family planning needs Fam
ily planning is the act of deciding how many children to have and how to
space out pregnancy keeping in mind fertility issues contraception prena
tal testing and other health concerns Family planning is a central topic
within genetic counseling sessions for BRCA patients as decisions about
managing cancer risk i e prophylactic oophorectomy might also impact
reproductive decisions However family planning communication
scholarship is still quite limited with regards to navigating the individual
preferences of patients Most literature notes the importance of family plan
ning as well as the struggle many go through in the process of making deci
sions regarding their reproductive health but research detailing
the process of how patients and genetic counselors communicate about
family planning is scarce
There is often an assumption that BRCA previvors want to get married
have kids and plan for a family once diagnosed However a recent study of
single unmarried Korean BRCA mutation carriers found that of
those surveyed no longer wanted to get married and who previously
wanted to bear children no longer want them Family planning schol
arship is often presented through a normative cisgender and heterosexual
lens leaving out others experiencing previvorship Additionally there is
minimal research on how the age of BRCA previvors impacts their family
planning and treatment choices These previvors may not interact
with genetic counselors in the same way as others and research is needed
to detail the experiences of those patients so counselors and other
healthcare providers understand the specific needs of all patients
Therefore this study asks
RQI What were previvors perceptions of communication with genetic
counselors and other healthcare providers about their diagnosis and
treatment plan
PEC Innovation
What were previvors perceptions of communication with providers
and experiences within the healthcare system related to family planning
Method
Study design
To examine BRCA previvors experiences with genetic counselors and
other healthcare professionals throughout their process of diagnosis sur
gery and recovery we used an exploratory qualitative interview approach
The data were collected as part of a larger study that examined reasons for
social media content creation by previvors although these data were not
previously analyzed The Institutional Review Board approved the study
protocol
Recruitment and eligibility
This study recruited individuals living in the United States who have
been found to carry a BRCAI or mutation and identify as woman
with the pronouns she her or a non binary person with the pronouns
they them Of the total participants n were women and one
was non binary However the non binary individual noted that they are
often perceived as female and have woman listed as their gender on
their medical paperwork for insurance purposes All participants were
white presenting but two identified as Hispanic and two identified as Ash
kenazi Jewish noting the importance of their ethnicity as related to their
BRCA status as one in Ashkenazi Jewish women have a BRCA mutation
All individuals had to be over the age of and could participate re
gardless of where they were in their BRCA journey Additionally all partic
ipants must have been active on at least one personal social media account
where they shared about their experiences publicly
Individuals were recruited through both Instagram and TikTok The
principal investigator searched popular hashtags related to BRCA includ
ing brca brcal previvor brcagene and breastcancerprevivor
Once accounts populated the researcher reached out to previvors who
listed their email addresses publicly on their social media accounts
explaining the project and requesting they respond if interested Once indi
viduals responded they were scheduled for interviews and provided with
the consent form
Procedure
Eligible participants were scheduled for a virtual interview over Zoom
Verbal consent was requested again at the start of each interview before re
cording was initiated All interview audio was recorded for accuracy and
transparency for the duration of the interview The interviews were based
on a semi structured interview format and topics included the previvor s ex
perience with BRCA up until the day of the interview their experience
working with genetic counselors and healthcare providers through their
journey their activity on social media and how they feel about the online
communities surrounding BRCA Each of the interviews lasted between
and min and sessions were transcribed verbatim by a professional tran
scription company Participants received compensation in the form of a
gift card
Analysis
Thematic analysis was implemented by the principal investiga
tor and supported by a graduate assistant GA This method was recently
applied to the study of BRCA previvorship as a label of identity and
to explore how previvors share about their experiences on Instagram
The transcripts were manually coded by the principal investigator and the
GA for patterns related to previvor s experiences with healthcare profes
sionals including genetic counselors We elected to follow the two stage re
view process recommended to maintain the rigor of the method including
an initial round of open coding followed by a d
