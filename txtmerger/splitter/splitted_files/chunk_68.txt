ABSTRACT
Background Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic unit diseases that have different prevalence
in different parts of the world Antiepileptic drugs AEDs are associated with major fertility risks for
women of childbearing age Due to the fact that studies on family planning methods in married women
with epilepsy WWE have not been conducted in Iran the aim of this study was to evaluate the family
planning methods in married WWE in Birjand Iran
Methods An analytical descriptive study was performed on married WWE hospitalized in the neu
rology ward or referred to Vali e Asr specialized and sub specialized clinic in Birjand Demographic infor
mation of patients as well as data on the type of used AED and various methods of family planning were
collected in a questionnaire Data analysis was performed using Chi square and Fisher tests All of the
above analyses were considered at a significance level of less than by SPSS v software
Results The mean age of the patients was years The mean age of experiencing the first sei
zure and the onset of menstruation were and years respectively Fifty
and patients used sodium valproate carbamazepine phenytoin levetirac
etam and lamotrigine respectively The results showed that sexually active patients used
family planning methods of which patients used withdrawal method patients used
condoms and patients used oral contraceptive pills OCP Eight patients had a history of
unintended pregnancy and patients had a history of abortion
Conclusion It is recommended to apply effective family planning methods in married WWE to prevent
unintended pregnancies and the subsequent adverse effects in the fetus considering the fact that a sig
nificant percentage of WWE did not use effective family planning methods and cases of unintended
pregnancies were reported Because of high consumption of valproate in women of childbearing age in
our study and concerning issue about its fetal malformation it is recommended to reduce the adminis
tration of valproate in this population Moreover regarding the low consumption of folic acid especially
for women of childbearing age and pregnant WWE who are taking AED the necessary recommendations
should be made by our physicians
Seizures and epilepsy are one of the most common diseases of
the nervous system Epilepsy has different prevalence in differ
ent parts of the world so that in the United States its prevalence is
per people There are no exact statistics in Iran but in a
study conducted in the prevalence of epilepsy was reported

Sayeh Miri the prevalence of epilepsy in Iran was estimated at
around in
Epilepsy severely affects a patient s quality
of life due to a variety of problems it causes On the other hand
improper control of epilepsy in patients leaves irreparable financial
and cerebral complications
Antiepileptic drugs AEDs are
associated with two major fertility risks for women of childbearing
age with epilepsy first the increased risk of unplanned pregnan
cies due to AEDs with induction of liver enzyme properties that
reduce sex hormone levels after taking oral contraceptive pills
F Ershadi Seyed Mohammad Mousavi Mirzaei N Tabrizi et al
OCP second the increased risk of birth defects Enzyme inducing
AEDs associated with OCP failure include carbamazepine pheny
toin phenobarbital and primidone These drugs reduce the estra
diol levels in OCPs by approximately and may also reduce
free progestin levels by increasing sex hormone binding globulins
SHBG AEDs have teratogenic effects in infants including mis
carriage neural tube defects premature birth and hypoxia They
also may cause labor like pains postpartum hemorrhage and
increased cesarean rates in mothers The mechanism of these
teratogenic effects is unknown in many cases but in the case of
sodium valproate it is stated that this drug interferes with ion
channels and thus causes side effects in various organs especially
in the brain
The AED valproate has a risk of developing
neural tube defects
Furthermore mental development is
reduced by in children exposed to valproate
The IQ
score of children exposed to valproate was the lowest averaging
about with and scores lower than carbamazepine and lam
otrigine respectively
Some chronic teratogenic effects that
have been reported by these drugs include congenital heart dis
ease urogenital defects hip dislocation hydronephrosis syn
dactyly and palate and cleft lip defects
Some of these
drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy
The awareness
of women with epilepsy WWE about the interaction of AEDs with
oral contraceptives and the potential for teratogenicity was evalu
ated and little knowledge was observed in these patients
Other studies have also shown the importance of accurate and reg
ular education of family planning methods in patients with epi
lepsy to prevent the teratogenic effects of AEDs
Due to the
fact that studies on family planning methods in married WWE
have not been conducted in Iran yet the aim of this study was to
evaluate the family planning methods in married WWE in Birjand
Iran

To the best of our knowledge this study was the first study that
has been conducted to evaluate family planning methods in mar
ried WWE in Iran Among patients with sexual activity
of the patients were using the family planning methods with
withdrawal method being the most commonly used method
The remaining patients did not use any family
planning methods despite receiving teratogenic drugs The results
of our study showed that IUD injection of depo medroxy proges
terone acetate and tubectomy were the least used methods
The pattern of family planning methods used among WWE in
developed and developing countries is different In developing
countries the family planning methods in WWE was reported only
in Senegal and Kenya
In a Senegalese cohort
only out of WWE used contraception with nearly
one third of them consuming oral contraceptive drugs
Furthermore WWE concomitantly used hormonal family plan
ning methods with AED including enzyme inducers and two of
them became pregnant despite proper contraception
In a cross sectional study in Kenya patients did not
use any type of family planning method during consumption of
AEDs Only WWE of reproductive age years were
using contraception Of these and used
injectable intra uterine contraceptive device condoms and bilat
eral tubal ligation BTL respectively
In developed countries
several studies evaluated prescribing patterns of contraceptive in
WWE of childbearing age For example in the study by Bhakta
et al out of WWE had a family planning method
Epilepsy Behavior
when taking a potentially teratogenic AED Of these the majority
of patients used an oral combined hormonal contra
ceptive or progestin only pill Five WWE were on depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate and were on an IUD either
levonorgestrel or copper
Another retrospective survey on
WWE showed that of patients used oral combined OCP for
It seems that the most common family plan
contraception
ning method in developed or developing countries is oral contra
ceptives while most of WWE do not use proper contraception It
should be noted that among the various methods of contraception
in WWE IUD appears to be an appropriate candidate This is
because the use of levonorgestrel containing IUDs prevents unin
tended pregnancies while does not alter epilepsy control and the
level of AEDs
Bosak s study suggested IUDs as an ideal contra
ception for WWE
The first and second line AEDs recom
mended by the World Health Organization WHO in sub
Saharan Africa SSA are as follows phenobarbital carbamazepine
phenytoin and valproic acid as the first line and lamotrigine and
levetiracetam as the second line of treatment First line drugs are
associated with adverse outcomes for the fetus
In the present
study the evaluation of prescribed AEDs showed that of the
patients were consuming sodium valproate carbamazepine
phenytoin levetiracetam and In devel
oped countries one study was conducted to describe the pattern of
AED use in pregnant women and women of childbearing age dur
ing a decade in the Lombardy region of Italy During
women of childbearing age prevalence were
prescribed at least one AED Pregabalin was the most common AED
in women of childbearing age followed by valproic acid
In the prevalence of valproic acid in women of child
bearing age was In this amount was Since
levetiracetam and lamotrigine have been the most commonly pre
scribed drugs for pregnant women
Another study retrospec
tively analyzed the use of valproate in pregnancy and in women
of childbearing age between and in Switzerland The
most commonly used AED during pregnancy was lamotrigine fol
lowed by levetiracetam and pregabalin Among women aged
years the most commonly used AED was pregabalin followed
by lamotrigine topiramate and valproate Valproate use decreased
from per women in to per women
Also frequency of AEDs during pregnancy in participants in
our study indicated that of pregnant mothers in this
study did not take any AEDs during pregnancy patients
took levetiracetam and patients took carba
mazepine In a study by Khomand et al it was found that the most
commonly used drug by pregnant WWE was carbamazepine
In both Nigeria
and Kenya
carbamazepine was the most
commonly used AED by pregnant WWE whereas in Senegal
phenobarbital was administered in up to of pregnant
WWE Although carbamazepine seems not be associated with a
significant increase in the risk of congenital malformations
a higher prevalence of congenital malformations of has been
reported in recent studies
Conversely in developed countries
the use of carbamazepine and valproate is declining For example
in a study by Man et al it was found that lamotrigine was increas
ingly consumed during pregnancy compared to carbamazepine
and valproate
A retrospective study in WWE found that
women received lamotrigine women took levetiracetam
women took carbamazepine took topiramate took oxcar
bazepine took phenytoin and used valproate
Although the use of valproate is decreasing in women of child
bearing age and pregnant women in developed countries yet val
proate is still one of the most commonly prescribed AEDs in
developing countries Valproate is the best therapeutic option for
idiopathic genetic generalized epilepsies however it is associ
ated with a high prevalence of fetal malformation and learning dis

Aim To suggest cut off points for body mass index BMI using gestational hypertension preeclampsia and gestational diabetes
mellitus GDM as cardiometabolic conditions in pregnancy Methods In this prospective study singleton pregnant women from
the fetal medicine service of the Brazilian Unified Health System were included The pregnancy perinatal and newborn data were
obtained from the clinical medical records Maternal anthropometry included an assessment of weight and height and the
prepregnancy BMI evaluation categorized according to the World Health Organization cut off points The area under the
curve and confidence interval values from receiver operator curves were generated to identify the optimal cut off points using
prepregnancy BMI with better sensitivity and specificity Results Data on pregnancies were analyzed with n
being classified as overweight obese n with GDM n with preeclampsia and n with
gestational hypertension The BMI cut off points for predicting cardiometabolic conditions were kg m S
E for women with GDM S E S E S E for women
with preeclampsia gestational hypertension and gestational hypertension plus preeclampsia respectively and kg m
S E for women with preeclampsia plus GDM Conclusion The findings suggest that the optimal prepregnancy
BMI cut off point is around m for pregnant women With maternal cardiometabolic conditions

Discussion
Our main finding was that the best prepregnancy BMI
threshold associated with cardiometabolic conditions during
pregnancy was around kg m Sensitivity considered the
most significant parameter in diagnostic evaluation
achieved an approximate rate of for gestational hyper
tension and for preeclampsia outcomes Furthermore
the ROC curve performance achieved a high AUC for gesta
tional hypertension using a prepregnancy BMI threshold of
kg
Regarding the GDM outcome BMI threshold of
kg m reached the lowest score among the outcomes
studied with a sensitivity of However the use of
the traditional adult BMI threshold of kg showed
worse performance reaching only sensitivity in the
sample Using the same traditional BMI of kg m as a
predictor of poor pregnancy outcome an average sensitiv
ity of was found in relation to preeclampsia and ges
tational hypertension
Pooled analysis of cardiometabolic outcomes shows that
the new suggested BMI threshold of has better
performance in predicting preeclampsia plus gestational
hypertension and the association of preeclampsia plus
GDM An average sensitivity of was achieved in both
outcomes The worst predictive performance of adult BMI
of m was achieved in the combined outcome of pre
eclampsia plus GDM with a sensitivity of only
Journal of Pregnancy
Regarding weight gain during pregnancy our sample
showed average adequacy of which is higher than the
international literature Research on weight gain during
pregnancy in Europe and North America reveals that ideal
weight gain is achieved in only to of pregnant
women The majority of cases tend to exceed the limit
resulting in overweight or obesity during labor and delivery
according to the adult BMI This is partly due to limited
access to nutritional counseling or obtaining foods with a
lower glycemic index during pregnancy
Selection of an appropriate BMI cut off point for Brazilian
women has been examined mainly due to the increasing prev
alence of noncommunicable diseases including obesity
A recent study carried out in Brazil focusing on women with
GDM highlights a substantial increase in maternal obesity
between the and to This highlights
the critical importance of prepregnancy monitoring for
women wishing to become pregnant
Previous studies have focused on various cutoffs for preg
nant women in different populations as part of efforts to
reduce chronic conditions An illustrative case is a case
control study carried out in Iran involving singleton preg
nancies conceived through assisted reproductive technology
This study identified a prepregnancy BMI of as
the threshold for an increased risk of GDM The authors
found a sensitivity of and a specificity of
Another retrospective cohort study that reviewed
medical records suggested that a lower prepreg
nancy BMI cutoff of kg to define obesity might be
appropriate for pregnant women in southern China The
authors suggest that this approach would better predict
adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes Unlike the anal
ysis in this article the authors found that the prevalence of
obesity was BMI kg due to the relatively
lean population
A recent study of pregnant women in China
focused on pregnancy outcomes and found a linear relation
ship between poor outcome and increased prepregnancy
adult BMI The authors evaluated gestational hypertension
with or without preeclampsia GDM cesarean section post
partum hemorrhage small for gestational age newborns
and macrosomia It was suggested that the ideal prepreg
nancy BMI range was between and with
the cut off point for overweight being kg and the
cut off point for obesity being
Adult BMI score compatible with obesity is considered a
strong predictor of general mortality among prospective epi
demiological studies In the context of pregnancy
the application of adult BMI thresholds is constrained
emphasizing that adult scores may result in low predictive
sensitivity for typical adverse pregnancy outcomes
In our study most women were classified as overweight
obese prior to pregnancy according to WHO criteria These
findings align with the global increase in overweight and
obesity which has reached epidemic levels in several coun
tries In Brazil a recent female cohort with par
ticipants found that the prevalence of overweight and
obesity more than doubled over the year span from
to
A systematic review and meta analysis of studies
revealed that prepregnancy overweight obesity status increases
the risk of the newborn large for gestational age macrosomia
and subsequent offspring at risk of future overweight obesity
Previous studies have shown that pregnancy obesity repre
sents a risk factor for GDM preeclampsia macro
somia and cesarean section
Among the new and more accurate techniques for pre
dicting adverse pregnancy outcomes the measurement of
maternal visceral adiposity using ultrasonography is becom
ing promising GDM outcome with measurements greater
than cm in the Armellini region distance from the linea
alba to the aortic cross in the maternal supraumbilical region
in the first weeks showed a significant odds ratio of
A similar study found a significant odds ratio of
among Armellini measurement greater than cm in non
obese prepregnant women Regarding the outcomes of
preeclampsia and premature birth with preeclampsia
Armellini region measurement above cm between
and weeks of gestation showed a significant relative risk
of and respectively even after control of concomi
tant pregnancy conditions
The study s main strength was the disease search at base
line and during the hospitalization process for labor and
delivery resulting in a GDM gestational hypertension and
preeclampsia double check Furthermore the study focused
in low risk pregnant women which simulates the majority
of outpatient care during pregnancy Here simple maternal
anthropometric measurements can become tools for
decision making in clinical practice routine
Limitations during the study unfortunately existed
including self reported prepregnancy weight reported by
some patients when weight information was not available
in first trimester prenatal records However several studies
demonstrated that using self reported weight in pregnant
women and young adults is valid Furthermore total
weight gain during pregnancy was obtained in approxi
mately of the sample This fact is due to the lack of rou
tine measurement of maternal weight during hospitalization
to labor and delivery
Conclusions
In summary the present study suggests that the use of adult
BMI thresholds among pregnant women may not be univer
sally applicable to all scenarios Instead adopting kg as
a cut off point threshold appears to be more effective in predict
ing adverse pregnancy related outcomes achieving a better bal
ance between sensitivity and specificity This allows for early
identification of pregnant women at risk for common metabolic
outcomes of pregnancy with superior accuracy Ultimately
early implementation of rigorous clinical and nutritional care
will lead to better maternal and perinatal outcomes
