Children on common ADHD medications
were identified and formed the case group
The most commonly used stimulant
medications include methylphenidate Ritalin
Concerta mixed amphetamine salts

Adderall dextroamphetamine Dexedrine
and lisdexamfetamine Vyvanse Non
stimulant medications with a specific
indication for ADHD include atomoxetine
Strattera guanfacine Intuniv Each case
was matched to up to controls based on sex
age race and low birth weight lb A
conditional logistic regression was conducted
among matched pairs to examine the impact
of mother smoking status during pregnancy
and ADHD
This study employed a case control study
design due the fact that ADHD could not be
commonly identified in this particular
database We only had about ADHD cases
A case control study is designed to help
determine if an exposure is associated with an
outcome i e disease or condition of
interest By definition a case control study
is always retrospective because it starts with
an outcome then traces back to investigate
exposures When the subjects are enrolled in
their respective groups the outcome of each
subject is already known by the investigator
Case control studies have specific advantages
compared to other study designs They are
particularly appropriate for studying rare
diseases or outcomes The practical value of
producing rapid results or investigating rare
outcomes may outweigh the limitations of
case control studies Because of their
efficiency they may also be ideal for
preliminary investigation of a suspected risk
factor for a common condition conclusions
may be used to justify a more costly and time
consuming longitudinal study later
Conditional logistic regression is an extension
of logistic regression that allows to take into
account stratification and matching Its main
field of application is observational studies
and in particular epidemiology Odds ratios
OR from logistic regression which is
exp coefficient is commonly used in the
medical literature as a measure of association
Authorized licensed use limited to Amrita School Of Engineering Kollam Downloaded on January at UTC from IEEE Xplore Restrictions apply
between exposure and outcome However it
is relative risk that people more intuitively
understand as a measure of association
Relative risk can be directly determined in a
cohort study by calculating a risk ratio RR
In case control studies and in cohort studies
in which the outcome occurs in less than
of the unexposed population the OR provides
a reasonable approximation of the RR
However when an outcome is common i Y
in the unexposed group the OR will
exaggerate the RR

In this case control study mother smoking
during pregnancy was significantly associated
with ADHD in children This is consistent
with other publication with cohort study
design The risk is times higher for a
mother who was smoking during pregnancy
to have a kid with ADHD than a month who
was not The true association between the
exposure and ADHD could not be known
however chances are it is between

population based control subjects
Adjustment for parental age or exclusion of

In another study Women who smoked
during pregnancy had a higher risk of getting
child with a high hyperactivity inattention
score than women who did not smoke during
pregnancy and the magnitude of the
associations was similar across cohorts with
very different smoking habits
There are many risks from smoking before
and during pregnancy so it is especially
important that women do not smoke during
their reproductive years CDC has gathered
many resources that healthcare providers can
use to help women quit smoking before or
during pregnancy and uses a public health
approach to eliminate tobacco use and
exposure during the reproductive years
There are limitations of this study This is a
case control study and it has all the
limitations associated with this type of study
design for example selection bias However
given the sample of the case group this type
of study design is necessary Secondly we

matched the cases and controls based on age
gender race as well as birth weight
however some variables important might be
not controlled for for example the number of
cigarettes smoked because of data availability
issue
In this case control study we confirmed
mother smoking during pregnancy was
significantly associated with ADHD in
children The magnitude of the associations
was similar with the findings in the literature
Additional efforts should be made to improve
the awareness of the increased risk of ADHD
in children associated with mother smoking
during pregnancy

Abstract According to Pakistan Medical and Dental Council
PMDC Pakistan is facing a shortage of approximately
medical doctors Due to the shortage of doctors a large number
of lives are in danger especially pregnant woman A large
number of pregnant women die every year due to pregnancy
complications and usually the reason behind their death is that
the complications are not timely handled In this paper we
proposed ontology based clinical decision support system that
diagnoses high risk pregnant women and refer them to the
qualified medical doctors for timely treatment The Ontology of
the proposed system is built automatically and enhanced
afterward using doctor s feedback The proposed framework has
been tested on a large number of test cases experimental results
are satisfactory and support the implementation of the solution

INTRODUCTION
The world has a shortage of professional medical doctors
even in the most developed countries have inadequate position
regarding the availability of medical doctors According to
Association of American Medical Colleges U S is facing a
shortage of approximately medical doctors In
Pakistan the situation is even much worse According to
Pakistan Medical and Dental Councils PMDC Pakistan is
facing a shortage of approximately medical doctors
Because of this shortage pregnant women are also affected
due to lack of proper and timely treatment which increased the
mortality rate of pregnant women over the years According to
world health organization WHO almost women die
every year from pregnancy related complications
Especially focusing on Maternal Mortality Rate it was
observed that most of the deaths occur because of few basic
complications Moreover these complications can be easily
treated once the reasons are diagnosed therefore the major
problem is the unavailability of proper diagnosis because of the
shortage of medical doctors
The four high risk pregnancy complications handled in this
work are Hypertension Obstructed Labor Septicemia and
Hemorrhage Increase in blood pressure during pregnancy

indicates Hypertension Obstructed Labor is an anomaly that
may arise during the process of labor Septicemia pollutes the
patient s blood and may occur due to infections caused by
bacteria and Hemorrhage occurs due to excessive loss of blood
from the patient s body
To overcome this problem we have proposed ontology
based clinical decision support system which can partially
work in place of doctors to diagnose high risk pregnant woman
and refer them to the qualified medical doctors for treatment
This way the high risk patients will get proper treatment well
in time and many lives can be saved The main focus of this
system is to build a diagnostic procedure which can work
independently of qualified doctors and identify high risk
patients Once these patients are identified they can be treated
by medical doctors So our system will help in reducing the
workload of doctors as well as providing basic health care to
more and more patients The framework is composed of three
components Automatic Ontology Construction
Feedback System and Ontology Enhancement Component
The rest of the paper is organized as follows In section
existing work in ontology based clinical decision support
system and automatic construction of ontology is discussed In
section the proposed approach is discussed Experimental
results are presented in section Finally the conclusion is
drawn in section
II LITERATURE REVIEW
A Ontology Based CDSS
There are many mistakes made on regular basis by humans
in clinical environments Hazmy Iman Abas et al in have
identified the three common mistakes made by clinicians that
are they failed to meet guidelines they are not educated on
regular basis and they are not aware of their responsibilities
According to the authors these mistakes can easily be avoided
by the use of ontology based clinical decision support system
The early detection of Alzheimer Disease is a challenging task
in medical domain Eider Sanchez et al in proposed an
ontological CDSS approach to detect Alzheimer in early
stages In this system multidisciplinary knowledge is used i e

the system uses three ontologies that are SWAN SNOMED
CT and MIND SWAN is used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer
Disease SNOMED CT s purpose is standardization and MIND
ontology is used to carry out patient tests Farahidayah Bt
Mahmud et al in designed a CDSS that finds the right time
of weaning a patient from ventilator According to the authors
the proposed Ontology based CDSS is very helpful because of
the ontology s ability of presenting complex concepts
reusability and specification of shared conceptualization
Similarly Adnan et al in proposed ontology based
clinical decision support system to assist electronic
discharge summary EDS while prescribing the patient s
medications Matt et al in developed an ontology based
CDSS for preoperative risk assessment The proposed system
takes the patient s data as input stores it in database and also
passes it to Ontology Modeler for conversion into OWL format
i e the same record is stored in two different formats
Afterwards inference is performed on both the database and
ontology Rule engine is used on the database to calculate the
numeric scores i e cardiac scores whereas classification
algorithm is run on the ontology to assign category to the
patient the results of both are then combined to calculate the
patient preoperative risk assessment
B Automatic Construction of Ontology
Abd Elrahman Elsayed et al in used data mining
technique decision tree on structured data to construct
ontology automatically In this approach the authors proposed
decision tree to ontology mapping where the tree decision
nodes are mapped to ontology classes and leaf nodes are
mapped to individuals The authors tested the proposed
approach on the soybean disease dataset and showed the
efficiency of the same Seongwook Youn et al in proposed
architecture for the classification of emails as spam or
legitimate using ontology based approach The authors created
a dataset D based on the features of the email i e spam email
and used WEKA decision tree to generate decision tree
which afterwards is passed to JENA for conversion into RDF
ontology format Authors divided the original dataset into two
parts i e training and testing dataset and tested the proposed
approach on testing dataset according to the authors the results
are satisfactory Amit Bhagat et al used association rule
mining to construct ontology from large transaction databases
In the proposed approach multiple level association rule
mining is used to extract more specific and relevant knowledge
as compared to single level rule mining Patrick Clerkin et al in
proposed automatic construction of ontology using the
COBWEB algorithm COBWEB is a clustering algorithm
which creates different clusters of the data in a hierarchical
manner In the proposed technique the hierarchy of the clusters
given by COBWEB is mapped into ontology classes in such a
way that parent cluster s is mapped as parent or super class es
in the ontology whereas the sub or child cluster s is mapped as
sub class es in the ontology Henrihs Gorskis et al in
reviewed the work done in the field of ontology building
using data mining techniques and the potential of different
techniques in the construction of ontology According to the
authors the ontologies created with data mining technique s
may be inferior to those constructed manually

Ill PROPOSED TECHNIQUE
In this paper we have proposed a framework for predicting
high risk woman using ontology based CDSS The framework
is composed of three main modules Automatic Ontology
Construction Feedback System Ontology Enhancing
Process
A Automatic Ontology Construction
This module automatically constructs the ontology of high
risk pregnant woman using pregnant woman dataset and is
composed of two sub components namely Rules extractor and
Rules to Ontology Mapper Rules extractor extracts the rules
from the pregnant woman dataset using WEKA and is
developed in Java WEKA API is used to call WEKA
functions from the program The dataset is given as input to
this component which uses WEKA API to extract rules from
the dataset The dataset is given in the ARFF Attribute
Relation File Format format which is compatible with WEKA
ARFF format has two sections the first section is Header
which contains the name of relation the attributes of the
relation and the attributes data types whereas the second
section has Data which contains the real instances of the
relations Example of partial IRIS dataset in ARFF format is
given below

Once the dataset is loaded attribute selection algorithm is
called using WEKA API We have used the genetic search for
attribute selection and once the most relevant features are
selected JRIP algorithm is called to extract rules which later
are used for the construction of ontology as summarized in
figure
Rules to Ontology Mapper is responsible to construct
ontology using the rules extracted in the first component as
shown in figure It first creates ontology classes for each
dataset i e hypertension Obstructed labor Hamorhage
Septicemia then the properties are created based on the
attributes found in the rules Furthermore the range and
domain of each property is set based on the information
provided by each dataset Afterwards for each class its
definition is created that reflects the classification criteria for
that class

B Feedback System
Once a patient is predicted as high risk by our proposed
system and recommended to the doctor for treatment feedback
is taken from the doctor whether the patient was correctly
identified or not If the doctor overrules the decision made by
the system the attributes which caused the decision are shown
to the doctor He can add delete the attribute s or tune their
parameters range i e change the values of an attribute to
more suitable one Afterwards the overruled instance with
tuned parameters or different attributes if any is added to
overruled dataset Once the number of instances in overruled
dataset reaches configurable this dataset is passed as input
to Ontology Enhancing Process for updating the ontology In
this way doctor s knowledge is incorporated in the system and
ontology is enhanced accordingly as shown in figure
C Ontology Enhancing Process
According to Gruber ontology represents knowledge
as a hierarchy of concepts and their relation for a specific
domain Furthermore ontology knowledge representation is
based on the concept of conceptualization which can be
defined as the objects the concepts and the relationship that
hold among them New concepts their properties and
relationship can easily be incorporated in ontology knowledge
base Therefore once the number of overruled instances
reaches p JRIP algorithm is executed on overruled dataset to
extract new knowledge and the same is updated in the
ontology either by creating new concepts or by defining new
relationship between the old concepts The complete
architecture of our proposed Ontology based Clinical Decision
Support System for predicting high risk pregnant woman is
shown in figure
lv EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A series of tests have been carried out in order to
demonstrate that the proposed system is working properly The
tests have been subdivided in two classes Automatic
construction of ontology and Ontology enhancement
Process Each of the experiment and its results are described in
following
A Automatic Construction of Ontology
This experiment is designed to verify the automatic
construction of ontology i e how well the rules are mapped
into ontology For this purpose the ontology and existing rule
base system are tested on the same datasets with the same
training and testing ratio In this experiment we used four
dataset for each output class i e Hypertension Obstructed
Labour Hamorhage Septicemia where each dataset is divided
into two parts i e and where of data is used
for training and is used for testing The experimentation
result showed that ontology and rule based system have same
accuracy which means the rules are transformed with
accuracy into the ontology as shown in figure
B Ontology enhancement Process
Enhancing the ontology is the most important aspect and
has been deeply validated In this activity fifteen doctors from
five different hospitals of Pakistan participated whenever the

patient is identified as high risk by our system the patient is
referred to one of the fifteen doctors If the doctor overruled the
decision feedback from the doctor is taken and the instance is
added to overrule dataset in this case the value is When
the instances in the overruled dataset reach p the new

ABSTRACT
A qualified health workforce is essential to receiving effective timely affordable equitable and respectful family
planning and comprehensive abortion care However in many countries health workers lack the competencies
required to deliver quality family planning and comprehensive abortion care services Competency based edu
cation and learning aims to train and assess competencies The theory supported approach focuses on outcomes
emphasizes the learner s ability to perform promotes learner centeredness and links the health needs of the
Primary health care workforce
population to the competencies required of health workers In the World Health Organization published a
guidance document Sexual and reproductive health Core competencies in primary care defining the competencies
that primary care providers need to safely deliver sexual and reproductive health services at the community level
and included family planning and comprehensive abortion care
In this article we describe the methodology and process undertaken in by the World Health Organi
zation to produce the family planning and comprehensive abortion care competencies guidance filling gaps
identified in the previous guidance document The World Health Organization s Family Planning and Compre
hensive Abortion Care toolkit for the primary health care workforce was published in and defines the key
competencies for health workers in primary health care providing quality family planning and comprehensive
abortion care services as well as support for developing programmes and curricula for education and lifelong
learning The Toolkit is useful for practitioners managers supervisors and employers educators regulatory
bodies and policymakers It is an important advance toward strengthening family planning and comprehensive
abortion care services in primary health care
Background
Competent health workers are essential to effective timely afford
able equitable respectful and universal health care UHC How
ever all countries to varying degrees face challenges in the education
retention and performance of their health workforce
In recent
years within a context of increased health system complexity and
interdependency the competency based approach to education and
learning has been widely adopted for health professions at all levels
Competency based education CBE facilitates the alignment of ability
and performance within and across health systems globally CBE can be
adopted for instruction preparation and assessment In contrast to
traditional input based education approaches whereby learning is
achieved through exposure to certain health and medicine related
content or curriculum for a specific amount of time CBE focuses on
achieving the desired outcomes
The World Health Organization WHO defines competencies as
the abilities of a person to integrate knowledge skills and attitudes in
their performance of tasks in a given context Competencies are durable
trainable and through the expression of behaviors measurable
Competencies provide benchmarks not just for education but also for
performance in the workplace They help to define standards of

performance but also to plan and measure professional development
improving job performance as well as learning
CBE strategy aims to
develop a person s abilities and concentrates on the goals and outcomes
of learning rather than prescribing a particular learning path with a set
of pre defined milestones
In CBE systems learning is based on the
acquisition of competency based learning outcomes that are objective
standardized and can be observed in practice and transferred and
translated across contexts
This approach to health care edu
cation has been implemented and adopted into policy internationally
Regulatory bodies have a fundamental commitment to sup
porting professional competence and therefore play a critical role in
promoting the implementation of CBE for health care
The knowledge skills attitudes and behaviors of health care pro
fessionals influence the quality and outcomes of services delivered
including in family planning FP and comprehensive abortion care
For example there is a significant relationship between
CAC
the uptake and continuation of FP and the skill of health professionals
offering counselling and services
Further estimates from
suggest that just under half of all abortions that occurred globally from
to were unsafe indicating that services were either carried
out by a trained provider using outdated methods a safe method was
used without appropriate support from a trained provider or the service
was provided by an untrained person using dangerous invasive methods
Despite this the inclusion of FP and CAC within Sexual and Repro
ductive Health SRH core competencies or curricula for education and
training is inconsistent across professional bodies creating a gap in the
competencies and standard of care necessary to meet the SRH needs of
populations
In WHO published a guidance document
Sexual and Reproductive Health Core Competencies in Primary Health
Care defining the competencies including knowledge skills attitudes
and behaviors that primary care providers need to safely deliver SRH
services at the community level including FP and CAC However in
during efforts to update the document it emerged that it con
tained gaps and had not been widely adopted
To set the standard of performance for FP and CAC service providers
and as part of a unique collaboration across UNDP UNFPA UNICEF
WHO World Bank Special Programme of Research Development and
Research Training in Human Reproduction HRP and the Department of
Health Workforce a competency development team was organized to
prepare the Family Planning and Comprehensive Abortion Care Toolkit for
the primary health care workforce
The Toolkit as of today consists of two volumes the FP and CAC
competencies are in Volume and Volume provides guidance on how
to develop competency based education programs and curricula
The FP and CAC competencies Volume are designed to
accommodate a range of health care workers contexts service delivery
mechanisms and evolving competency requirements The FP and CAC
Toolkit was intended as a foundational tool that can be adapted by ed
ucators and regulators for current and future health practice and focus
on the core functions of primary health care providers toward universal
health care whoever is providing them In this article we describe the
methodology and process undertaken by the competency development
team to develop the FP and CAC competencies published in Volume of
the Toolkit to both advocate for the use of these core competencies in
health care education learning and continuing professional develop
ment and to encourage the development of competencies for other areas
of practice
Development and validation of FP and CAC core competencies
There is not one universally accepted model or guidance for the
development of core competencies for health care professions
or
ganizations have used a range of processes and methods WHO under
took the development of the FP and CAC competencies in a series of
phases The first phase consisted of a review of key literature the second
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
phase involved focus group discussions FGDs the third phase devel
oped the competencies the draft competencies were refined and vali
dated in phase four an on line global DELPHI consultation
to
achieve consensus and the final phase was a virtual Town Hall style
meeting to confirm the competencies and gauge their global acceptance
The phases brought together different sources of data to develop and
validate the competencies We discuss each phase in turn below
Phase Literature review
The competency development team conducted a review of existing
literature on SRH competencies to inform the structure and content of
the FP and CAC competencies
The specific objectives of the liter
ature review were to collect evidence from published and unpub
lished documents to identify how the WHO SRH competencies
framework had been used examine what aspects of the document has
been useful and which ones had not and identify any additional
domains and competencies to be included in the FP and CAC
competencies
The competency development team used the following terms to
locate published and unpublished literature for review competencies
competency frameworks competency based education SRH ser
vices family planning and comprehensive abortion care They
used these terms to search websites of international health organizations
and professional associations for relevant documents The team
analyzed and reviewed documents to determine whether they had value
based on the objectives of the review and credibility as sources using
specifically designed templates until they achieved saturation
In total the team purposively selected and reviewed documents
including articles and reports published from until October
The findings of the literature review were summarized into tables

tional competencies that could be added to the revised framework
Overall the findings of the literature review suggested that the FP
and CAC competencies would benefit from an increased focus on ado
lescents and population groups in vulnerable settings the addition of
post abortion care and postpartum family planning among others
improved flexibility or associated strategies tools in adapting the
competencies to various contexts e g humanitarian settings and
occupational groups e g due to health workforce optimization and
include advice on how to implement at the country level The review
also indicated that the FP and CAC competencies should place greater
emphasis on addressing provider bias values clarification managing
care in restrictive environments religion laws community norms and
the use of data for decision making The review findings further sug
gested that structurally the FP and CAC competencies should avoid
overlap between the competencies and domains provide additional
detail be more user friendly
and take a lifespan approach Finally
according to the review the updated document should list essential
competencies and encourage countries to add their own content and
competencies These results informed the content and structure of the FP
and CAC domains and competencies included in the Toolkit Volume

The team conducted FGDs to explore stakeholder perceptions and
use of the WHO Sexual and reproductive health Core competencies in
primary care document and understand stakeholder needs for FP and
CAC competencies The FGDs were designed to complement and address
any gaps in information identified by the literature review The team
invited faculty policymakers practitioners trainers and members of
relevant professional organizations to participate in two virtual FGDs in
November Of these individuals thirteen attended the first FGD
and participated in the second The FGDs aimed to explore What
are the current challenges in the delivery of FP and CAC services
Were you aware of the WHO Sexual and reproductive health Core
competencies inprimary care and What recommendations do you have
for the FP and CAC competencies
The analysis of the FGDs took a phenomenological study approach
The team identified and categorized themes within and across
interview data to describe the phenomena of interest The team
discovered that most of the participants were familiar with the
WHO SRH framework Of these some mentioned that the WHO
SRH framework had not influenced practice and needed to be updated in
line with recent evidence from WHO guidelines for FP and CAC Others
described the framework as lacking contextualization and including
excessive information that was not easy to interpret thereby limiting its
practical use Participants explained that the framework lacked infor
mation on health workforce optimization tools for actual implementa
tion and monitoring and details on how to perform procedures
Furthermore they argued that it was also missing the social component
Challenging issues such as working with minors maintaining confi
dentiality operating within restrictive laws providing services during
pandemics and in humanitarian settings required further elaboration
Guidance on training faculty members and addressing care in terms of
human rights also needed additional explanation
FGD participants described several obstacles to the delivery of FP
and CAC including misconceptions and stigma among providers reli
gious and legal restrictions affecting service provision provider bias the
relationship between adequate theoretical knowledge and effective
practice or competency and the lack of access to services among people
in vulnerable settings Participants identified issues with formal edu
cation program such as inconsistency between pre service training and
service provision inadequately prepared faculty members providing
poor quality education lack of procedural and national guideline
training missing and or outdated equipment at facilities and poorly
selected clinical learning sites Management issues included having an
inadequate number of trained staff managers lacking authority to share
U R Loi et al
tasks between different occupations and inadequate supervision Par
ticipants also felt there was lack of coordination between government
and other organizations the private sector and development partners
The participants made recommendations for the new FP and CAC
competencies For example they suggested that FP and CAC compe
tencies should include content on the development of communication
skills recording interpreting and practical use of data inclusion of
post pregnancy FP and CAC in pre service education programs self care
and health promotion and increased time for hands on skill acquisition
The participants felt that faculty members needed to be updated on SRH
service provision They added that professional development and on
the job trainings are important mechanisms to be included to maintain
the competence of faculty Other recommendations included the use of
competencies in actual practice to simplify and make it more user
friendly guidance on how to use the competencies in different contexts
the provision of incentives and other opportunities to encourage use of
the competencies Finally there was a request for a dissemination and
implementation strategy to be articulated at national level with all
stakeholders engaged in the process
Phase Constructing the competency document
The results of the literature review and the FDGs formed the basis of
the initial draft of the FP and CAC competencies The team additionally
ensured that the competencies were aligned with the new WHO Abor
tion Care guideline
They retained Domain A from the SRH
Competency Framework which listed necessary attitudes and
values for providing high quality SRH care
For the
Fig

the technical competencies These domains included client
centeredness decision making
collaboration
communication
evidence informed practice and personal conduct Each competency
specifies the knowledge and the behaviors required Fig Finally the
draft FP and CAC competencies included three practice domains H to
J respectively shared FP and CAC competencies FP competencies and
CAC competencies The practice competencies are specific but not
exclusive to FP and CAC and distinguish FP and CAC practitioners from
other health care workers The competencies were designed to be suit
able for defining learning outcomes or learning objectives both for
formal education and for non formal and informal learning
Phase Second tier corroboration Delphi Consultation
The Delphi Consultation process was conducted from September to
November to achieve consensus on the content of the draft FP and
The competency development team con
CAC competencies
ducted two rounds of virtual Delphi consultations to gather feedback
gauge agreement with the content of the draft FP and CAC competencies
and receive suggestions for improvement and additional content They
recruited potential participants by sharing an invitation to FP and CAC
practitioners and educators globally A wide variety of relevant orga
nizations also nominated potential participants and an invitation was
also distributed through the Implementing Best Practice IBP Network
members
Potential participants were invited to nominate other
experts and practitioners in a snowball recruitment process using
Survey Monkey The invitation included a short video explaining how
important and valuable their expertise would be to the process to
encourage them to join the consultation
