The data reviewed above suggest that
although twin pregnancies are associated
with a higher incidence of GDMAI
GDMAI in twins is less likely to be
associated with adverse maternal and
neonatal outcomes is not associated
with accelerated fetal growth and may
be associated with a reduction in the
proportion of small fetuses Taken
together these findings raise the ques

requires treatment or whether the iden

might lead to more harm than good

In a case controlled study entitled
Glycemic control in twin pregnancies

et al assessed the relationship between
glycemic control and pregnancy out
comes among women with a twin
pregnancy complicated by GDM The
authors found that improved glycemic
control was not associated with a
reduction in the risk for preeclampsia
but was associated with a greater risk
of having an SGA infant Although
this study was the first to support
the hypothesis that treatment of GDM
in twins may cause more harm than
good it was relatively small considered
Clinical Opinion
preeclampsia as the only potential
adverse outcome did not stratify the
analysis by the type GDM and did not
include a control group of twin preg

Therefore we recently addressed the

control group of women with a twin
pregnancy without GDM The study
outcomes were a composite variable of
GDM related neonatal morbidity LGA

found that good glycemic control was not

good glycemic control was associated

good glycemic control was not associated

Diet controlled gestational diabetes in
twin pregnancies as a physiological
exaggeration of the normal increase in
insulin resistance meant to support

The observations described above
further challenge the current view that
GDMAI in twin pregnancies is a pa
thology that merits screening and
treatment Instead these findings pro
vide the basis for the hypothesis that the
greater transient increase in insulin
resistance observed in twin pregnancies
which is often interpreted as GDMAI
based on the standard diagnostic
criteria is merely a physiological exag
geration of the normal increase in in
sulin resistance observed in singleton
pregnancies designed to support the
metabolic requirements of fetuses
This hypothesis is aligned with the fact
that most of the physiological changes
American Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology
of pregnancy are exaggerated in twin
For example when
pregnancies
compared with singleton pregnancies
twin pregnancies are associated with a
greater increase in cardiac output
vs a greater increase in
stroke volume and a greater in
crease in blood volume vs
to support the larger feto
placental circulation in the presence of
fetuses and yet we do not treat
women with twin pregnancies with
drugs such as beta blockers or diuretics
in an attempt to normalize their cardiac
function and blood volume respec
tively to the levels observed in singleton
pregnancies Therefore the greater in
crease in insulin resistance found in
twin pregnancies should perhaps also
be viewed as a physiological exaggera
tion of the normal increase in insulin
resistance observed in singleton preg
nancies that is meant to support fe
tuses acknowledging that the only
problem with this specific exaggerated
MONTH
physiological change is that it is detec
ted as a pathology by the screening and
diagnostic tests for GDM that were
developed and validated in singleton
pregnancies And if that is indeed the
case then what is needed is to use
alternative twin specific screening and
diagnostic criteria for GDM in twin
pregnancies that take into account this
exaggerated physiological change

However similar data on the perfor
mance of the screening GCT in twin
pregnancies are lacking In a recent
meta analysis on the screening accuracy
of the GCT in twin pregnancies
we identified a total of studies All
studies were retrospective and included
information on the diagnostic OGTT
only for women with a positive screen
during the GCT
Consequently none of the studies nor
our meta analysis could determine the
sensitivity and specificity of the
GCT for GDM in twin pregnancies This
means that the GCT is currently
used to screen for GDM in twin preg
nancies with the same threshold used in
singleton pregnancies despite the fact
that there are currently no data on the
screening accuracy of this test in the twin
pregnancy population
In of the studies mentioned
Rebarber et found that when
compared with the
standard
threshold of mg dL used in their
practice a higher threshold of
mg dL mmol L maintained the
same sensitivity but reduced the risk
for a false positive result in twin

that in twin pregnancies the optimal

than that used in singleton

In a more recent large population

which the
standard GCT
screening threshold was mg dL

screening performance of the
GCT between women with singleton

found that based on the estimated

However the extra increase in insulin resistance in twin pregnancies may reflect a physiological

that case the goal is to avoid the diagnosis of GDM in twin pregnancies when the mild degree of
hyperglycemia is solely caused by the exaggerated physiological increase in insulin resistance

OGTT criteria in relation to future
maternal risk of type diabetes has been
used in singleton pregnancies for the
development and validation of the original
g OGTT diagnostic thresholds for
GDM by O Sullivan and Mahan which
were subsequently transformed to the
Carpenter and Coustan thresholds because
of technical changes in maternal blood
glucose measurement
and are
currently used for the diagnosis of GDM in
the United States We speculate that if
O Sullivan and Mahan were to stratify their
original analysis by plurality they would
have found that the OGTT thresholds were
higher in twin pregnancies than in
singleton pregnancies similar to our
findings
Clinical Opinion
What are the concerns regarding the
use of twin specific criteria
One of the main concerns regarding the
use of more liberal twin specific diag
nostic criteria for GDM in twin preg
nancies is that in utero fetal exposure to
mild hyperglycemia even if not associ
ated with immediate neonatal
morbidity may disrupt optimal fetal
programming and lead to long term
metabolic complications similar to
those reported among singletons
including childhood obesity diabetes
and future cardiovascular disease
However most data on the association
of GDM and accelerated fetal growth
with long term morbidity in the
offspring originates from studies in
singleton pregnancies whereas similar
long term follow up studies in twin
pregnancies are lacking In addition
even if these associations also apply to
twin pregnancies it should be noted that
the association between deviant fetal
growth and long term morbidity in the
offspring is more pronounced for intra
uterine growth restriction and low birth
weight than for LGA Thus it may be
argued that even if GDMAI is associated
with a mild degree of fetal growth ac
celeration in twin pregnancies the
reduction in the proportion of small
twin fetuses who are smaller than the
average singleton fetus and are at greater
risk for growth restriction and the po
tential to avoid intrauterine growth re
striction secondary to strict glycemic
control in twin pregnancies with
GDMAI may lead to an overall reduc
tion in the long term metabolic risk of
the twin pregnancy offspring population
Figure Still studies on the long
term metabolic health of twin infants
or studies that use surrogate markers for
these outcomes such as cord c peptide
neonatal fat mass and epigenetic
markers would provide important
insight into the optimal diagnostic
threshold and glycemic targets for GDM
in twin pregnancies

Our main findings are as follows
twin pregnancies are associated with a
higher incidence of GDMAI than
singleton pregnancies the greater
incidence of GDMAI is likely to be
mediated by the greater transient in
crease in insulin resistance that occurs in
twin pregnancies instead of reflecting
lower maternal pancreatic beta cell
dysfunction and greater maternal pre
disposition for type diabetes
GDMAI is less likely to be associated
with adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes and with accelerated fetal
growth in twin pregnancies than in
singleton pregnancies and may be asso
ciated with a reduction in the proportion
of small infants and there is no
American Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology
evidence that the diagnosis and treat
ment of GDMAI in twin pregnancies is
associated with improved maternal and
neonatal outcomes in fact there is some
evidence that strict glycemic control in
cases of GDMAI in twin pregnancies
may substantially increase the risk of
intrauterine growth restriction Collec
tively these findings support the hy
pothesis that the greater transient
increase in insulin resistance observed in
twin pregnancies which is often inter
preted as GDMAI based on the standard
diagnostic criteria is merely a physio
logical exaggeration of the typical in
crease in insulin resistance that occurs in
singleton pregnancies that is meant to
support the metabolic requirements of
MONTH
two fetuses instead of a pathology that
requires treatment
We therefore conclude that a major
priority for future funding in twin
pregnancy research is to establish twin
specific screening and diagnostic
criteria for GDM which can avoid the
overdiagnosis of GDM and reduce the
risks associated with over treatment of
GDMAI in twin pregnancies Although
preliminary data suggest that the optimal
g GCT screening cutoff and the
OGTT diagnostic criteria in twin preg
nancies are higher than those currently
used in singleton pregnancies these
exploratory twin specific criteria need
to be validated in adequately powered
prospective studies Until such data

caution in cases for which there is evi

A study on referral pattern for fetal
echocardiography and identifying the various risk
factors for congenital heart defects
Abstract
Background Fetal Echocardiography is becoming an important tool for the detection of
CHD but results can be unpredictable depending on various factors like expertise position
of the baby and referral indications Various factors are associated with detection of CHD
which need further evaluation
The present study was undertaken to study the referral pattern for Fetal Echocardiography
FE at a tertiary Pediatric Cardiac Centre and further to identify the various risk factors
associated with Congenital heart defect
Results The study was conducted on consecutive pregnant women who were referred
for fetal echocardiography at Pediatric Cardiac Unit of the hospital The mean maternal age
and the mean gestational age were years and weeks at the time of
fetal screening On evaluating the various referral indications gestational diabetes mellitus
was found in of the study subjects but CHD was detected in of their fetuses
Hypothyroidism was the second commonest indication among the referrals and
of their foetuses were found to have CHD The indication that accounted for the maximum
number of CHD was cardiac anomaly detected on ultrasonography followed
by single umbilical artery in which of CHD was detected CHD was however
significantly associated only with the referral indications of cardiac anomaly on USG p
value and single umbilical artery p value The association of the other
referral indications of the subjects was not found to be significant
Conclusion Majority of women referred late for the fetal echocardiography screening
Extracardiac anomaly during second trimester scan warrants immediate fetal cardiac
evaluation

Background
A congenital heart defect CHD is defined as a defect in
the structure of the heart or great vessels occurring during fetal
development l The prevalence of CHD globally is around per
thousand live with a mortality of per population
Prenatal detection of CHD is of utmost importance since heart defects
are associated with significant morbidity and mortality besides
antenatal detection helps in planning the further management Fetal
echocardiography is becoming an important tool for screening and
can identify many structural heart diseases but it is highly variable
depending on operator expertise gestational age fetal position and
the type of cardiac defect but there is improvement in detection of
CHD lately The yield of fetal echo in detection of CHD depends
not only on the expertise of the performer but also on the indication
of referral Nevertheless its an important tool for early detection of
CHD and with the availability of newer and highly sophisticated
dedicated machines CHDs can be detected in utero during second
trimester or even in late first trimester with a detection rate of
in specialized units
There are numerous risk factors associated with development of
CHD pregestational diabetes is an important and most documented
one by various authors S American Heart Association in has
provided a list ofrisk factors for screening the high risk mothers leading
to CHD in fetus The referral pattern for fetal echocardiography
among pregnant women is a reflection of the spectrum of women
visiting for fetal echocardiography and it assists in identifying and for
better understanding of congenital heart defects and the risk factors
associated with it
Methods
The aim of the study was to study the referral pattern for Fetal
Echocardiography FE at a tertiary Pediatric Cardiac Centre and
to identify the various risk factors associated with Congenital heart
defect lt was a prospective observational study conducted at Pediatric
Cardiac Unit ofa University affiliated tertiary medical care facility
Study population The study was conducted on consecutive
pregnant women who were referred for fetal echocardiography during
the study period at Pediatric Cardiac Unit of the hospital Valid
informed and written consent was obtained from the pregnant females
before including them in the study The study was approved by the
Ethical committee of the Medical College
Sampling procedure The information was recorded in a predesigned
proforma for the profile of patients pregnant women indications
of referral and the risk factors if any associated with CHD were
identified

anomaly on ultrasonography screening were found to have congenital
heart defects the maximum proportion of CHD While one out of
three women referred with an indication of single umbilical artery was
found to have a congenital heart disease There was one CHD
in each group of polyhydroamnios women and women with a
history of CHD in their previous child One CHD was detected in the
fetus of one of the women who had a referral indication of previous
unexplained early neonatal deaths CHD was detected in the fetus of
four of women with gestational diabetes mellitus Only I
out of women with hypothyroidism was found to have CHD
in their fetuses None of the fetuses with echogenic intracardiac foci
foetal bradycardia and history of Down syndrome in previous
child had CHD However six women were in the miscellaneous
group four of whom had haemophilia A and two of whom had vitiligo
CHD was not detected in their foetuses
Spectrum of congenital heart disease among fetuses Table
illustrates the various types of congenital heart diseases that were
found among fetuses on Fetal echocardiography Out of I I CHDs AV
canal defects were the most common accounting for ofthe total
CHDs Hypoplastic left heart syndrome HLHS was the second most
common CHD detected The distribution of single ventricle
and isolated ventricular septal defect VSD was equal i e
Apart from CHDs various other cardiac abnormalities were also
found in the fetuses on echocardiography as depicted A significant
tricuspid regurgitation T R was found in the fetuses of six women
Five fetuses had ventricular disproportion of which three had more
left ventricular LV than right ventricular RV disproportion Dilated
RV was found in two women while one had ventricular hypertrophy
Type of congenital heart disease in each group Different types of
CHDs were detected in the various categories of referral indications
are depicted in Table In the category of gestational diabetes mellitus
four fetuses were found to have CHDs of all detected CHDs
which included one AV canal defect two HLHS and one isolated
V SD With polyhydramnios and single umbilical artery one fetus in
each group was found to have CHD which was HLHS
Association between various factors and congenital heart
diseases There was no significant association with the parity and
age of the mother with the incidence of CHD in the fetus Table
