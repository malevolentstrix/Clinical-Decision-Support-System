Discussion
Findings in this second update of our living systematic
review remain consistent with our original review and
our previous update for prevalence of covid rates
of clinical manifestations and outcomes in pregnant
and recently pregnant women in studies published
before the predominance of SARS CoV variants of
concern One in pregnant or recently pregnant
women who are attending or admitted to hospital for
any reason were diagnosed as having suspected or
confirmed covid and the rates varied by sampling
strategy Pregnant and recently pregnant women were
less likely to show covid related symptoms of fever
dyspnoea cough and myalgia than non pregnant
women with covid Although testing for SARS
CoV in non pregnant women is based on symptoms
or contact history testing in pregnant women is
usually done when they are in hospital for reasons that
might not be related to covid Pregnant or recently
thebmj I doi bmj
pregnant women with covid were at increased
risk of requiring admission to an intensive care unit
and invasive ventilation compared to non pregnant
reproductive aged women with covid Increased
maternal age high body mass index non white
ethnicity pre existing comorbidities and pregnancy
specific conditions such as pre eclampsia and
gestational diabetes are associated with severe disease
Compared to pregnant women without covid
pregnant women with covid are at increased risk of
death admission to the intensive care unit stillbirth
delivering preterm and their babies being admitted
to the neonatal unit However the overall rates of
stillbirth and neonatal death remain low in women
with suspected or confirmed covid Absolute
increases in maternal deaths admissions to the
intensive care unit preterm births caesarean sections
and admissions of babies to the neonatal unit were
observed for pregnant women with covid compared
to pregnant women without the disease Substantial
heterogeneity was observed in the estimates for rates
of clinical manifestations and outcomes which varied
by sampling frames participant selection and risk
status of the participants
This second update of the living systematic review
includes more than double the number of studies
included in the first update and four times more
pregnant women with covid There continues to
be increased precision in estimates for previously
identified risk factors for severe disease in pregnant
and recently pregnant women with covid including
stronger association between risk factors such as non
white ethnicity and pregnancy specific conditions
such as gestational diabetes and pre eclampsia and
increased risk of adverse outcomes in pregnant women
with covid than without the disease

Strengths and limitations of this review
In this unprecedented pandemic situation where
evidence is rapidly produced and published in various
formats our living systematic review underpinned by
robust methods and continually updated at regular
intervals is important for several reasons Firstly
it addresses important research questions relevant
to clinical decision making and policies Secondly
uncertainties remain for key outcomes that require
further evidence Thirdly the rapid turnover of
evidence in various formats requires assessments of
study quality and regular updating of the findings
Finally our living systematic review is producing
strong evidence base for living guidelines on covid
and pregnancy
We undertook a comprehensive search and
coordinated our efforts with key organisations and
research groups such as WHO US CDC Cochrane Centre
and EPPI Centre To minimise risk of bias we restricted
our meta analysis to cohort studies and we reported
the quality of the included studies By contacting
the authors and obtaining reports not published in
PubMed we minimised the risk of missing relevant
studies Our systematic review has a large sample size
and it is continuously increasing Our living review
framework will enable us to rapidly update the findings
as new data emerge We undertook extensive work to
ensure that duplicate data are not included Our various
comparative analyses allowed us to comprehensively
assess the association between pregnancy and

covid related outcomes covid and pregnancy
outcomes risk factors for SARS CoV infection and
complications Our review helps to understand the
variations in estimates through sensitivity analyses by
sampling strategies population characteristics and
risk factors and it provides confidence in the rates of
reported outcomes The second update has allowed
us to incorporate new evidence from studies and
more than two million women published since our first
update in February
Our systematic review also has limitations
Although our search spans the entire year none
of the studies included was conducted by the time
of emergence of any SARS CoV variant of concern
Despite every effort to quickly update the evidence
the number of new studies identified and the rigor
required to remove duplicates meant that the review
did not consider current changes in the pandemic such
as variants of concern and vaccination which could
affect reported prevalence rates and presentation
The primary studies used varied sampling frames to
identify women with covid consisted of women
with suspected and confirmed covid and primarily
reported on pregnant women who required visits to
hospital including for childbirth thereby affecting
the generalisability of the estimates Although our
thebmj I doi bmj
sensitivity analyses aimed to tackle some of these
problems the numbers and sample sizes of the
individual studies were too small to identify differences
between the subgroups The timing of assessment of
the clinical manifestations of disease was generally
not available The definitions of symptoms tests
and outcomes were heterogeneous Furthermore
poor reporting of the criteria for caesarean section
admissions to the neonatal unit and the causes
of preterm birth made it diffcult to disentangle
iatrogenic effects from direct pathophysiological
effects of the disease Studies comparing maternal and
perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with covid
against historical cohorts of pregnant women could
be biased owing to differences in the environment in
which births occur During the pandemic healthcare
systems have faced increased pressure and strain on
services with resulting effects on service delivery and
quality of care
Lockdown measures physical
distancing and changes to livelihood have led to
increased depression and anxiety and reduction in
physical activity and access or attendance to healthcare
facilities and could have also contributed to maternal
and perinatal complications
Not many studies reported outcomes by trimester for
symptom onset making it difficult to assess the rates of
CD
o
RESEARCH
miscarriage and postpartum complications For some
outcomes the findings were influenced by a few large
studies
Comparison with existing evidence
Between the publication of the first update of the living
systematic review and this second update estimates
for the prevalence of covid and rates of clinical
manifestations and outcomes of pregnant and recently
pregnant women with covid have remained similar
with a slight reduction in rates and improved precision
in findings We found a reduction in caesarean section
rates and admission to the neonatal unit compared
with the first update which could be attributed
to increasing knowledge of the disease and better
healthcare practices The rate of maternal pneumonia
appears to also be lower High heterogeneity remains
in the estimates for rates of clinical manifestations and
outcomes
We found that the same risk factors for severe covid
identified in the original version and first update of
the living systematic review remained associated
with severe covid in this second update with
increased precision Our findings on the association
of severe covid with ethnic minority status in
pregnant women are consistent with similar reports
of disproportionately high rates of severe covid
in non pregnant ethnic minority populations and
disparities in other areas of maternity care by ethnic
The observed disparity could be
minority status
attributed to associated comorbidities socioeconomic
characteristics and factors related to access to and
quality of care in the preconception pregnancy and
postpartum periods The multifaceted contributors
to ethnic disparities need to be investigated to reduce
mortality and morbidity related to both covid and
pregnancy This latest version of our review update
also identified an increased risk of caesarean section
neonatal death and stillbirth in pregnant women with
covid compared to pregnant women without the
disease
Alongside the spread of the pandemic a shift has
occurred in the types of studies published with initial
studies involving pregnant women from epidemic
regions in China followed by reports of large regional
and national datasets from the US UK Netherlands
Spain and Latin American countries However few
reports have come from African countries The study
design has also changed from initial small case series
and case reports to large observational data with
recent studies also providing comparative data
The prevalence of covid varied widely between
studies particularly when sampling was done based
on symptoms or history of contact highlighting the
variations in criteria for testing The current update of
our living systematic review includes twice as many
studies as our first update on the overall prevalence
of covid in pregnancy Despite the addition of
more studies from diverse populations globally the
prevalence of covid in pregnant and recently
pregnant women remains unchanged Unlike the
general population who are mostly tested for SARS
CoV based on symptoms or contact history universal
screening of all pregnant women attending the hospital
for any reason could contribute to the consistency in
the findings However the true prevalence of covid
in pregnancy is likely to be lower than the current
estimate if all pregnant women including those not
attending the hospital are included
Despite the potential higher possibility of universal
screening to detect pregnant women with mild disease
we observed an increase in admissions to the intensive
care unit and need for invasive ventilation compared
with non pregnant women of reproductive age with
covid These results were mainly influenced by
the large US CDC report the Canadian Surveillance
of covid in pregnancy report and a report from
the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology
registry
By accessing the unpublished data from our
collaborators we were able to include women
both with and without symptoms from the US CDC
surveillance data in addition to the women with
symptoms only who were included in the published
report Pregnancy status was not ascertained in
a large proportion of women of reproductive age in
the CDC report which could affect the estimates
Furthermore the outcomes for which the data were
missing from the report were considered to be absent in
women potentially leading to bias The report from the
Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology registry
remains available only as a preprint and included only
women with symptoms who might be at higher risk of
complications Non pregnant women in the Canadian
Surveillance report included women years of age
compared to years in the pregnant women group
We recommend that studies comparing covid
related outcomes in pregnant versus non pregnant
women report the relevant estimates for both women
with and without symptoms to avoid overestimation of
the risk of complications due to selective reporting The
pooled estimates for severe covid and admission to
an intensive care unit were however still relatively
high in the non comparative data indicative of a
potential increased risk in pregnancy This is supported
by an analysis in a Swedish study suggesting a high
risk of admission to an intensive care unit and invasive
ventilation in pregnant women compared to non
pregnant women and similar results reported in a
recent French national cohort study suggesting higher
risk of mortality admission to intensive care unit and
pregnancy related complications in pregnant women
with covid compared to pregnant women without
the disease
Similar to the general population high body mass
index and pre existing comorbidity seemed to be risk
factors for severity of covid in pregnancy including
admission to an intensive care unit and invasive
ventilation Complications related to covid did
not seem to be increased in women presenting in
the third trimester versus earlier in pregnancy or in
multiparous versus primiparous women but existing

sample sizes are not large Both chronic hypertension
and pre existing diabetes were associated with
maternal death in pregnant women with covid
which are known risk factors for death in the general
population But it is not known if covid was
the direct cause of death for these women and the
numbers of studies are small
We observed an increase in rates of preterm birth
in pregnant women with covid compared with
pregnant women without the disease These preterm
births could have been medically indicated owing
to maternal disease and resulting fetal distress as
the overall rates of spontaneous preterm births in
pregnant women with covid was broadly similar
to those observed in the pre pandemic period The
overall rates of stillbirths and neonatal deaths were
still relatively low with the absolute differences for
stillbirth not significant between the groups A recent
report from the US CDC found that relative risk of
stillbirth with covid in pregnant women increased
significantly after circulation of the delta variant in the
US from an adjusted relative risk of before delta
dominance to during delta dominance Rates
of adverse outcomes should continue to be monitored
as new SARS CoV variants continue to emerge Local
policies on observation and quarantine of infants
with exposure to SARS CoV might have influenced
admission rates to the neonatal unit which was lower
in this second update than in our first update
Relevance for clinical practice and research
Based on existing data healthcare professionals
should be aware that pregnant and recently pregnant
women with covid might manifest fewer symptoms
than the general population with the overall pattern
similar to that of the general population Pregnant
women should be informed of the increase in severity
of covid including admission to intensive care units
and invasive ventilation compared with non pregnant
women and should be encouraged to undertake safety
measures to reduce the risk of infection including
receiving the covid vaccine to reduce risk of
severe disease Pregnant women with pre existing
comorbidities will need to be considered as a high risk
group for covid along with those who are obese
and of older maternal age Healthcare professionals
need to be aware of the increased risk of severe disease
in pregnant and recently pregnant women of non
white ethnic origin to plan close monitoring and have
a low threshold for escalation of care Clinicians will
need to balance the need for regular multidisciplinary
antenatal care to manage women with pre existing
comorbidities against unnecessary exposure to the
virus through virtual clinic appointments when
possible Pregnant women with covid before term
gestation might need to be managed in a unit with
facilities to care for preterm neonates
Further data are still needed to robustly assess the
association between pregnancy specific risk factors
such as pre eclampsia and gestational diabetes
and covid related outcomes Robust collection
thebmj I doi bmj
RESEARCH
of maternal data by trimester of exposure including
the periconception period is required to determine
the effects of covid on early pregnancy outcomes
fetal growth and risk of miscarriage or stillbirth We
need detailed reporting of outcomes by ethnicity to
quantify the risk of severe covid in women from
different ethnicities Qualitative studies on behaviour
and attitude to the pandemic can help to disentangle
the relative importance of factors behind the ethnic
disparities observed in the severity of covid
Understanding and dealing with inequities in social
determinants of health that put ethnic minority groups
at higher risk of severe disease can help improve
outcomes in this group
Evidence syntheses on covid faces unprecedented
unique challenges even for agile designs such as
living systematic reviews Firstly there is rapid change
in the nature of the virus with emerging variants
of concern with varied infectivity presentation
and outcomes Primary studies in non pregnant
and pregnant populations suggest increased risk of
hospital admission and death with the alpha and
delta variants of concern compared with the wildtype
However the timeline of most of the
variant
published literature lags with regards to the emerging
variants of concern As we update our search beyond
the pre variant period we are likely to encounter
new studies reporting on pregnancies before and
after the emergence of variants In such instances it
will be inappropriate to update our meta analysis by
combining all studies
Secondly countries are rapidly rolling out covid
immunisation programmes which affects the
prevalence presentation and outcomes in general and
pregnant populations Similar to the methodological
challenges with the variants it is also inappropriate
to update our meta analysis without considering
vaccination status
Thirdly our living systematic review aims to
synthesise evidence rapidly as they emerge However
many primary studies publish partially duplicated
data published elsewhere or at different time points
or report different categories of outcomes for the same
participants in multiple journals Furthermore large
numbers of non peer reviewed scientific papers and
reports are available in the public domain in multiple
versions Because primary studies do not often
explicitly state if duplicate data have been included
we had to undertake resource intensive efforts to check
each included study against all studies published
since the beginning of the pandemic to avoid double
counting of participants This approach led to delays
between completion of the search and finalisation of
data for analysis
With the establishment of several national and
global prospective cohorts we expect the sample
size of our meta analysis to increase further in the
coming months Future reviews will need to consider
the effects of variants of concerns on the rates of
coivd manifestation of symptoms and the risk

pregnant and recently pregnant women In doing so
we propose a shift in how the findings are reported In
order to capture the trends in prevalence presentation
and outcomes of SARS CoV in pregnancy in line
with the changing environment in terms of variants
and vaccination status we plan to synthesise and
present the data according to the time of recruitment
of participants rather than the traditional update by
timing of publication Providing such data in half
yearly intervals alongside information on the trends
in variants and vaccine status would provide accurate
information reflecting the underlying conditions
Including vaccination information within global
systematic reviews of covid and pregnancy will
also allow collection of data on the range of covid
vaccines that are in use in different settings which
can inform international guidelines on vaccination
in pregnancy This information could lead to stronger
recommendations on covid vaccination for all
pregnant women and help combat misinformation on
vaccination in pregnancy

ABSTRACT
Background Studies on the health effects of metal mixtures typically utilize biomarkers measured in a single
biological medium such as blood or urine However the ability to evaluate mixture effects are limited by the
uncertainty whether a unified medium can fully capture exposure for each metal Therefore it is important to
compare and assess metal mixtures measured in different media in epidemiology studies
Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the mixture predictive performance of urine and blood metal
biomarkers and integrated multi media biomarkers in association with birth outcomes
Methods In our analysis of women from the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort we measured essential and
non essential metals in repeated and paired samples of urine and blood during pregnancy For each metal we
integrated exposure estimates from paired urine and blood biomarkers into multi media biomarkers MMBs
using intraclass correlation coefficient ICC and weighted quantile sum WQS approaches Using Ridge re
gressions four separate Environmental risk scores ERSs for metals in urine blood and MMBvvQs were
computed as a weighted sum of the metal concentrations We then examined associations between urine
blood and multi media biomarker ERSs and birth outcomes using linear and logistic regressions adjusting for
maternal age maternal education pre pregnancy body mass index BMI and second hand smoke exposure The
performance of each ERS was evaluated with continuous and tertile estimates and confidence intervals of
the odds ratio of preterm birth using area under the curve AUC
Results Pb was the most important contributor of blood ERS as well as the two integrated multi media biomarker
ERSs Individuals with high ERS tertile showed increased odds of preterm birth compared to individuals
with low ERS tertile with fold CI to for urine specific gravity corrected fold
CI to for blood fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using ICC
and fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using WQS The four ERSs had
comparable predictive performances AUC ranging from to when urine is examined with specific
gravity corrected concentrations
Conclusions Within a practical metal panel measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture Applications in practical study design require validation of these
methods with other cohorts larger panels of metals and within the context of other adverse health effects of
interest

Introduction
Exposure biomonitoring which estimates human exposure by
measuring chemical or other agents of interest or their metabolic
products in different biologic media such as blood and urine Strimbu

biomonitoring has become indispensable in
studies of mixtures Due to limiting factors such as financial cost and

While this approach may capture
overall exposure to a class of chemicals with similar structure and
pharmacokinetic properties such as urinary phthalates and blood per

chemical classes such as metals Because each metal possesses
