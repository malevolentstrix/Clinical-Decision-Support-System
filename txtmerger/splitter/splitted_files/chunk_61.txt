Discussion
In this study we present the largest cohort of pregnant women tested for SARS Cov worldwide and the first
analysis of primary data stratified by the severity of maternal disease allowing us to identify specific risk factors
associated with adverse maternal outcomes
Severe adverse outcomes defined by maternal death admission to ICU and or advanced oxygen support
were observed in of cases Pulmonary comorbidities hypertensive disorders and diabetes mellitus were
significantly associated with an increased risk of severe maternal outcomes while usual pregnancy related risk
factors were not No difference in the livebirth rate was observed between pregnant women with severe adverse
outcomes and patients with an uncomplicated course Nevertheless a significant increased risk of caesarean sec
tion preterm birth and neonatal admission to the intensive care unit was observed highlighting that obstetrical
and neonatal outcomes are influenced by the severity of maternal disease
The rate of severe disease observed here is similar to what has been previously reported in other large
and summarized in a recent meta where the risk of severe disease among pregnant women
with COVID was estimated to be CI Importantly this risk of severe maternal complica
tions appears significantly higher when compared to a non pregnant population at an equivalent age with an
increased odds of ICU admission or mechanical ventilation up to CI and CI
Risk factors for severe maternal disease appear to be similar to what has been previously described in the
general population namely pulmonary pathologies hypertension and Congruently in their meta
analysis Allotey et al observed an increased risk of severe disease among pregnant women y o those with
chronic hypertension pre existing diabetes or body mass index Interestingly in our study after adjust
ment obesity was not independently associated with an increased risk of severe adverse outcomes This could be
explained by the fact that overweight patients often suffer from hypertension and diabetes metabolic syndrome
which could act as the predominant causal factors Both are associated with macro and micro vascular com
plications and endothelial dysfunction has been suggested as a major pathophysiological mechanism associ
ated with COVID severity In pregnancy endothelial change is a well known mechanism of obstetrical
complications such as gestational hypertension HELLP Hemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelets and
pre and may contribute to the increased risk of COVID complications In our study we did
not observe any association with maternal age This could be explained by the low number of patients Y O
included Similarly ethnicity non Caucasian versus Caucasian was not associated with poorer outcomes unlike
previously
We observed a rate of positive test among newborns born to mothers with a positive SARS CoV test
The clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear as at the time of the study we were lacking comprehensive
data regarding COVID related symptoms or COVID suspected symptoms among newborns repeated testing
and long term follow up Perinatal transmission of SARS CoV has been reported by others both in case of
vaginal and cesarean sections and was associated in some cases with neonatal symptoms
In all reported
cases the possibility of postnatal infection through contacts with parents or medical personal remains diffcult

to excludel Alternatively transplacental transmission has been suspected in few cases where specific IgM
were detected among newborns Nevertheless perinatal vertical transmission appear to be rare and mainly
associated with good neonatal outcomes
Our study has several limitations First we present here the outcomes among pregnant women with a con
firmed SARS CoV infection and therefore only observational conclusions can be drawn regarding the absolute
risks of severe disease and adverse obstetrical neonatal outcomes as a control group of negative patients was not
included Nevertheless this was beyond the scope of the present study whose first aim was to identify specific
risk factors
Second heterogeneities exist between participating centers in the testing of pregnant women While some
centers performed routine systematic screening of presenting women independently of compatible symptoms
other only tested symptomatic pregnant women This could have led to a selections bias of more severe sympto
matic COVID cases Ifa symptomatic SARS CoV infection is associated with poorer maternal obstetrical
and neonatal outcomes this selection bias may have resulted in an overestimation of the absolute risk of adverse
outcomes However the rate of asymptomatic infections among included positive women of n
is quite similar to the rate of asymptomatic infection described in the general population estimated to range
around and suggests a low impact of this potential bias Similarly patients admitted with severe
disease were very likely systematically tested for SARS CoV which may have led to a possible overestimation
of the actual rate of severe adverse outcome among positive patients Follow up analysis including patients with
ongoing pregnancies with an uncomplicated course based on systematic screening will help assess the exact risk
in a more general population of pregnant women
Third most patients were included during the trimester of gestation with the majority included close
to delivery while pregnancies were still ongoing at the time of analysis Although we did not observe any
impact of the gestational age i e WG on the severity of maternal disease this could be related to a lack
of statistical power Pregnancy related vascular complications only occur after WG which would suggest
an increased risk of maternal complications in cases of maternal infection at a later stage of the pregnancy as
observed by In our cohort severe maternal outcomes were also observed in women exposed at WG
with an overall similar risk n to what was described in the whole cohort Therefore caution should
also be taken with pregnant women infected in early pregnancy
Although our data regarding obstetrical outcomes are reassuring definite conclusions cannot be drawn
Infections occurring at an earlier stage of gestation may be associated with poorer obstetrical outcomes Viral
particles have been detected within the placentas of women infected earlier during pregnancy
Although
placental infection seems rare it has been associated with evidence of malperfusion
which is known to be
associated with reduced fetal growth and intra uterine fetal death Of note Khalil et al have shown an increase in
the number of stillbirths during the epidemic peak without being able to determine whether this is a direct effect
of the At the time of analysis pregnancies WG that were exposed during the and trimesters
were still ongoing Fig suggesting an uncomplicated course Subsequent analysis including those patients
are needed to better define obstetrical and neonatal outcomes
In conclusion pregnant women particularly those with associated comorbidities seem to be at higher risk
of severe complications of SARS CoV infection Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes appear to be influenced
by the severity of maternal disease complications include caesarean sections neonatal prematurity and neonatal
admission to the intensive care unit Further studies are needed to assess maternal and neonatal outcomes for
cases of earlier exposure

Abstract Perception and knowledge of risk factors for pregnancy influence health behaviors during
pregnancy and childbirth We used a descriptive qualitative study to examine the perception and
knowledge of risk factors in pregnancy and childbirth in low income urban women in Ghana Over
the course of three months focus group discussions and six individual interviews were conducted
with participants selected from six communities in the study area Data were analyzed using
inductive thematic content analysis Findings revealed that participants had knowledge of some risk
factors although some had superstitious beliefs Participants viewed pregnancy as an exciting and
unique experience but also challenging with a host of medical and psychological risks Pre existing
medical conditions e g diabetes lack of physical activity poverty poor nutrition and lack of social
support were identified as conditions that could lead to negative pregnancy outcomes Superstitious
beliefs such as exposure to evil eye during pregnancy as well as curses and spells were also
identified as risk factors for pregnancy complications This research has implications for policies and
programs to improve pregnancy outcomes for low income women in Ghana Thus we recommend
social and economic support programs as well as health education to change misperceptions about
pregnancy risk and to support other efforts being made to improve maternal health outcomes
Keywords perception knowledge risk in pregnancy women low income communities
Introduction
Risk is defined as a factor that presents eminent danger or increases the probability
of experiencing adverse outcomes Perception on the other hand refers to a mental
image or subjective ideas about a potential occurrence of a phenomenon The concept
of perception is important because it is a driver of health seeking behavior and the man
agement of health outcomes Risk perception therefore refers to risk interpretations
or understanding as well as subjective judgements about risk In the field of health
risk perception denotes subjective judgements about the likelihood of negative or adverse
outcomes of conditions such as illnesses injuries diseases or death Perceptions and
knowledge about risk are important determinants of health behaviors and risk related
decision making such as whether to adopt or not to adopt healthy behaviors and reject or
accept a certain level of health risks
Risk perception has two dimensions the cognitive aspect which relates to how much
individuals know and understand risks and the emotional aspect which relates to how
people feel about themselves and a potential risk Research on risk perception often
begins with the presumption that how people feel about danger is determined by the level
of knowledge and certainty they have regarding that risk This idea is founded on the
rational choice model of decision making which presents individuals as rational beings
who evaluate the possibilities of health outcomes after first estimating the prospective costs
and benefits On the other hand laypersons usually assess risk by using heuristics for

Women
example previous experiences and other informal ways of thinking This means that
when people are aware of certain risks or potential risks they tend to believe that those
risks could happen more frequently than the risks actually occur and vice versa These risk
misinterpretations rooted in heuristics can cause people to overestimate or underestimate
the occurrence and severity of potential health threats
According to Lennon risk perception in pregnancy entails both the objective
medical evaluation of risk as well as a subjective socially constructed risk guided by a
complex web of personal psychological and cultural factors It includes the assessment of
the possibility of harm or negative health outcomes to either the mother or the newborn
or both However sometimes this harm or risk is not related to a particular medical
condition instead women may see pregnancy and childbirth as inherent risks rather
than conditions that cause the risk In recent years risk perception and the way risks are
construed in pregnancy have received a lot of scholarly attention This can be explained
in part by the growing prevalence of a medicalized perspective on pregnancy and the
social pressure placed on women to behave in a way that lessens the perceived risks
Increasingly medical interventions are seen as both necessary and desirable for successful
pregnancies as the state of pregnancy has become more and more medicalized Thus
seeking preventive services such as antenatal screening genetic screening and testing as
well as health behavior modifications are considered necessary to reduce any potential risk
of pregnancy complications
Furthermore considerable evidence shows that perceptions and understanding or
knowledge of risk are shaped by many factors including socio cultural background
levels of literacy and religious or traditional beliefs An individual s knowledge
and interpretation of risk is also dependent on their personal life philosophy and previous
experience It has been documented that sometimes women perceive risk in relation to
pregnancy from the social perspective where risk is seen as being influenced by the social
cultural and political milieu in which they reside Wheeler and colleagues for
example reported women s employment experience during pregnancy as an important
factor in determining their perception of risk in pregnancy Furthermore other scholars
have reported that maternal age personal and family history knowledge about
pregnancy and childbirth as well as level of risk or complication in pregnancy
are important determinants of perception and understanding of risk in pregnancy These
factors can influence opinions interpretations of and values put on the risks and even
benefits associated with pregnancy In a qualitative study on pregnancy risk perception
and preterm birth Silva and colleagues found that personal negative experiences in
previous pregnancies such as stillbirths miscarriages having a preterm birth or neonatal
death informed risk perceptions of the current pregnancy Women s perception of risk in
pregnancy has also been attributed to their knowledge base of risk
Perception and understanding of risk in pregnancy have the effect of influencing
various critical pregnancy and childbirth decisions They affect decisions such as when
and where to seek antenatal care where to give birth or choice of maternity site who
supervises the birth and even the mode of delivery Silva and colleagues also
argued that a patient s risk perception of health guides his or her decisions on treatment
and can further influence health seeking behavior during serious conditions such as pre
term births one of the most critical potential risks faced during pregnancy Janson on
childbirth decisions and traditional structures in Ghana explained that women who viewed
childbirth as a natural process and without potential risks or ill health may consider home
delivery as the best option Traditionally in Ghanaian society pregnancy and childbirth
are viewed as a vulnerability and potentially dangerous experiences that do not only
require biomedical care but also spiritual intervention Therefore many women seek a
combination of care biomedical care traditional care which involves the use of herbal
medicine and spiritual support faith healing and prayer in the pregnancy period with
the hope of averting any perceived or actual health risk to the pregnancy and during
childbirth The focus of this paper therefore is to present findings from a study
Women
that investigated women s perception and knowledge of risk in pregnancy and childbirth
and how these affect their maternal healthcare seeking behavior in selected low income
communities in Accra The implications of the findings for maternal and newborn health
policies and programs are discussed
Materials and Methods
Study Design
This was a descriptive qualitative study that targeted women in selected low income
communities in Accra Ghana The data were gathered over a three month period through
focus group discussions FGDs and interviews to examine women s perception and knowl
edge about risk in pregnancy and childbirth
Study Area
The study was conducted in the Ashiedu Keteke sub metropolitan district in the city
of Accra Ghana s capital Ashiedu Keteke is one of the sub metropolitan districts of
Accra Metropolitan City and has some of the poorest communities in the city Using the
Greater Accra region population growth of the sub metropolis has an estimated
population of about in The sub metropolis has the Central Business
District CBD and it is the center of major commercial activities within the city of Accra
with an influx of approximately million people from all parts of the country daily As
the center of commerce it houses the Markola and Agbogbloshie markets which are two
major markets within the Greater Accra region The population of Ashiedu Keteke is made
up of the indigenous Ga people who live in the coastal communities along the Gulf of
Guinea the Atlantic Ocean and other migrant populations who reside a bit further away
from the coast The main occupation of the indigenous Ga people is fishing the men do the
fishing and the women smoke the fish for the market The migrant population engages in
small scale commercial activities mostly trading
In terms of health care the Ussher Polyclinic the Prince Marie Louise Children s
Hospital and the James Town Maternity are among the major health facilities that provide
care to residents in the sub metropolitan district Maternal health continues to be a health
challenge as Ashiedu Keteke has one of the poorest maternal health outcomes in Accra and
has a persistently high teenage pregnancy rate in the city There is high prevalence
of the use of informal maternal health care traditional birth attendance faith healing and
prayer by pregnant women in the area especially among the teenage and indigenous
mothers From available data about of pregnant women who reside in the sub
metropolitan district do not seek antenatal care until the second and third trimesters a
situation quite a bit higher than the national average of
Sampling of Participants and Data Collection
Purposive sampling was utilized to select six communities within the study area for
the FGDs and individual interviews Altogether women between the ages of and
years were recruited for focus group discussions and six individuals were involved
in the interviews For the FGDs a snowball sampling approach was employed to recruit
women who had at least one child We conducted two FGDs in each of the communities
We divided the women in the FGDs into two age cohorts those aged to and those aged
to Each FGD had an average of seven participants and lasted between min We
conducted six FGDs with each age cohort Additionally six women with at least one child
from each of the six communities one mother from each community were interviewed for
about min to elicit in depth perspectives on the subject matter Two community leaders
assisted with the recruitment of the study participants
The FGDs and individual interviews both used comparable questions which were
framed around our research objectives We asked participants about their knowledge and
risk perceptions with regard to pregnancy and childbirth and how these factors influenced
their healthcare seeking decisions and behaviors during pregnancy and childbirth Both
Women
FGDs and interviews were carried out with the assistance of our two fieldworkers and in
two local languages spoken in the study area The two field assistants were native speakers
of the two local languages Ga and Twi The FGDs and interviews were audio recorded
with the participants permission
Ethical Consideration
The Human Subject Review Committee of the University of Massachusetts Amherst
School of Public Health granted the ethical approval of the research Additionally we
received authorization from the local health administration in the study area and verbal
consent from all study participants prior to their enrollment in the study Since most of our
study participants had only a basic formal education we only sought verbal consent from
them prior to recruitment into the study and assured them that information obtained from
the FGDs and interviews would be kept confidential and only the lead researcher would
have access to the raw data Participation in the study was voluntary and they had the
option of withdrawing at any time
Data Analysis
The data analysis began during the data collection phase and continued following
FGDs and interview sessions With the assistance of our two fieldworkers audio recordings
of both FGDs and interviews were transcribed from the local languages into English
Following transcription we cross checked the transcripts to confirm that the responses
had been accurately transcribed and translated from the local languages to English We
reviewed the final transcripts in order to determine which words phrases and statements
were pertinent to our primary research questions and objectives We classified the data
into nine themes using an inductive content analysis approach proposed by Corbin and
Strauss and Miles and colleagues
We first identified and cataloged the major concepts and recurring ideas in each
interview transcript Second we compared and classified the significant concepts and
emerging themes from the interview transcripts We did the same thing with the transcript
data from the FGDs we compared significant concepts and developing themes within and
across FGDs The raw text section containing the essential concepts and ideas were coded
manually and classified according to the emergent themes To ensure the findings internal
validity we compared and contrasted data segments from the FGDs with the individual
interviews
In this article we present data on nine themes that emerged from our
analysis
Results
The nine themes were identified as the following factors first trimester experience
medical conditions lack of physical activity antenatal care lack of social support poverty
and poor nutrition sleeping posture and hot showers exposure to certain conditions and
spells and curses
First Trimester Experience
According to most of the participants pregnancy during the first trimester period
is associated with both joy and risk The participants reported that the usual thought of
being pregnant brings joy and hope but the experience during this period could be
challenging for many women Participants explained that during the first trimester the
pregnant woman is unable to eat as she experiences general body weakness morning sick
ness fevers severe headaches dizziness heart palpitations and sleeplessness Although
these are normal they could pose serious health risks to the woman during this period
of the pregnancy The women described psychological problems such as fears anxiety
and stress that a woman could experience during early months of the pregnancy Two
participants explained it this way
Women
When a woman is pregnant she does not feel well as she used to be the whole
experience can make you feel sick and you know this feeling of sickness can last
during the whole pregnancy period for many women the first three months can
be hard on you you become anxious and afraid
FGD participant
In my case I always felt like I was going to fall down in my early months But
this feeling happens to many pregnant women so its normal to feel that way
because your body is adjusting it begins to go away after the third months for
most pregnant women Interview participant
Medical Conditions
Both FGD and interview participants were of the view that complications could occur
in pregnancy when a pregnant woman already has a pre existing disease They explained
that pre existing diseases or infections such as malaria diabetes candidiasis odeepu
or HIV can increase the vulnerability of a pregnant woman This is because it is not easy
to carry a pregnancy when you are already sick or have a disease Interview participant
Having a chronic condition
like AIDS or sugar disease diabetes and becoming
pregnant could be challenging as you don t sit at home You will need to go to the clinic
for regular and proper care FGD participant These medical conditions could expose
the woman to the risk of experiencing a difficult pregnancy labor and delivery and could
affect the baby s health as well
According to the participants in the FGDs other medical conditions indicating that the
pregnant woman is at risk of complications are high blood pressure swelling in the hands
and feet anemia and delay in the delivery of the afterbirth or the placenta Participants
also mentioned bleeding during pregnancy and childbirth as a major health risk for the
mother and the baby These views were also expressed by the women in the individual
interviews as exemplified by a personal experience of an interview participant who said
I don t have an easy pregnancy My second pregnancy was the worst of all I
had swollen feet and hands and they nurses said my blood pressure was going
up at some point and I thought those were not good signs for my pregnancy
especially when they told me my pressure was going high and I had to come in
for regular review Interview participant
Lack of Physical Activity
Another risk factor identified was being physically inactive during pregnancy Ac
cording to some of the participants a pregnant woman who is physically inactive or does
not exercise could likewise be at risk for a difficult and prolonged labor as explained in the
following statement by an FGD participant
You see there are pregnant women who don t do any work they don t walk
they just sit at one place and they stop coming to the market But there are others
who work with their pregnancy They go to the farm and do everything When
you are not active the baby will not be active The baby cannot turn or move in
the womb and you will have problem during delivery
FGD participant
Antenatal Care
Most of the participants said women who do not seek medical care or attend ante
natal clinics could be at risk of pregnancy complications During the FGDs participants
recounted that a pregnant woman should seek regular health care to prevent potential
complications that could affect the pregnancy and to ensure a successful birth A participant
in the FGDs noted a situation where the mother failed to seek antenatal screening for
early risk detection and treatment it leads to conditions such as fetal malpresentation or
malposition a critical condition for prolonged labor FGD participant
Women
Similar views were also shared by participants in the interviews who identified
prolonged labor as a risk a pregnant woman could be exposed to during childbirth if she
fails to attend an antenatal clinic
Lack of Social Support
According to the participants pregnant women who do not have adequate spousal
or family support could experience difficult pregnancy and childbirth because pregnancy
could be stressful and emotionally demanding As a result if the pregnant woman is
not adequately supported it could negatively affect her health and that of the unborn
baby Two FGD participants explained the effect of a lack of social support on pregnancy
outcomes in the quotation below
I know a young woman that the man who made her pregnant refused to accept
the pregnancy Her parents are not living here referring to her community and
she does not have any other family member in Accra here The baby she delivered
was very small You know she didn t have any support she was always by
herself and only got a little help from neighbors and that affected the baby FGD
participant
Sometimes these young mothers work long hours The kayaye teen girls head
porters who are pregnant they carry heavy loads in the market for people
who come to shop or do groceries They don t have their families or anybody
here to help them It is stressful to do this kind of job when you are pregnant
FGD participants
These findings were corroborated by the interview participants who reported a lack
of social support for young migrant pregnant women in the study area as a major risk
factor for negative pregnancy outcomes The following remark was made by a participant
in support of this assertion when you go to the market right now you see them young
female migrant porters carrying big bowls full of load for people with their pregnancy
Some of them don t even know the fathers of their babies and their parents are not here to
help them and this is not good for the pregnancy Interview participant
Poverty and Poor Nutrition
Poverty emerged as an important risk factor for pregnancy and childbirth compli
cations Both FGDs and interview participants agreed that poverty could lead to poor
nutrition among pregnant women leading to poor pregnancy outcomes because a preg
nant woman should ensure she eats well on time and the right portions which is a major
problem for some women According to the participants some pregnant women don t
have the money to buy enough food and that could affect their health and the pregnancy
as well A pregnant participant in one of the FGDs confirmed this and said the poor
mothers who don t have families here their general health begins to become worse after
delivery This is because when they go home there is nothing there to eat and their babies
cannot grow because they don t feed them well since they themselves don t eat well FGD
Participant According to some participants the young pregnant migrant mothers who
lived in the study area relied on neighbors for meals when they became pregnant One
FGD participant also put it this way
if they don t get this assistance they don t eat Some pregnant mothers eat
small portions of meal in the morning and they don t eat until evening because
they don t have families here Accra and the men who made them pregnant
didn t accept the pregnancy FGD participant
These findings were supported by some of the interview participants who said that
the young pregnant migrant mothers usually worked for long hours carrying heavy loads
to make a living and to save towards delivery which exposes them to pregnancy related
risks The quotation below highlights this issue
Women
Oh when you go there markets right now you will see them working in the
market they carry loads in the market Some sell under the hot sun and this is
not too good for the pregnancy but they need the money so they and their babies
can have food to eat the weeks following delivery Interview participant
Furthermore most of the participants thought that poverty made it difficult for preg
nant mothers to attend antenatal clinics and delayed care during labor exposing the
pregnant woman and the baby to life threatening complications
Sleeping Posture and Hot Showers
Both the FGDs and interview participants agreed that when a pregnant mother sleeps
on her back it can affect the health of the mother and the unborn baby They explained that
when a pregnant mother sleeps on her back it obstructs the flow of oxygen from the mother
to the unborn baby and this could be fatal for the unborn baby as well as the mother
This sleeping on your back during pregnancy is not good for your pregnancy
when you are pregnant you don t sleep on your back You sleep by your side
People pregnant women who sleep on their back can hurt their baby the baby
cannot breath because air will not flow from you the mother to your baby so
they tell us not to sleep on our back They are not good practice for the baby so
you can kill your baby because the baby cannot get air from your when you sleep
on your back
FGD participants
Some participants also reported that taking hot water showers and baths could nega
tively affect the pregnancy Two participants explained
they say bathing with hot water is not good warm water is okay hot
water is not good for the baby too It can make the baby temperature go up
Interview participant
Bathing with hot water can make you the mother feel hot and you can pass
heat on to the baby in your womb so you don t take hot showers when you are
pregnant FGD participants
Exposure to Certain Conditions
One major perceived risk in pregnancy mentioned by the participants is the exposure
of the unborn baby to conditions that can cause the child to acquire certain health defects
such as cerebral palsy called asram in the local language This often happens if the
pregnant woman does not take very good care of herself and her pregnancy For example
if the pregnant woman does not dress well she could expose herself and her pregnancy
unborn baby to individuals with such conditions This is based on the belief that cerebral
palsy is transferrable spiritually from a person who has the condition to the mother and
then to the baby to be born Asram is a spiritual disease that can be passed on through
eye contact when a pregnant mother comes into contact with an individual who spreads the
disease One interview participant elaborated on this perception in the following quotation
For a disease like asram when you are pregnant you don t have to eat everywhere
When some people see the pregnancy they can transfer the disease to the unborn baby
You have to dress decently so that you don t expose yourself and your pregnancy
Some people dress exposing their body when they are pregnant
So when you
dress like that and you come across someone with the disease that individual can
transfer the disease to the baby Interview participant
Some participants also reported that cerebral palsy can kill and that it can only be
treated with traditional or herbal medicine For example during the FGDs one mother
recounted her experience with asram it asram affected me and my baby and I was
taken to a certain woman for herbal treatment for almost a year before my baby was
FGD participant
Women
Spells and Curses
Participants also narrated that a woman can be at risk of pregnancy complications
and or even death if she is cursed during pregnancy According to most FGD participants
when a pregnant woman is disrespectful or often picks quarrels with neighbors a curse
could be cast on her and this may lead to stillbirth and death during childbirth This view
was confirmed by a participant in th
