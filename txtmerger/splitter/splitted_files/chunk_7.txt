th outcomes P Bls can also enhance effec
tiveness by stimulating innovation enhancing teamwork
incentivizing service in remote locations and improving
retention
Literature focuses on individual effect of P Bls on
health worker motivation but not on the combined
effects of CDSS and P Bls on performance Our
previous study in Ghana s Upper East Region was one of
the first to analyse the combined effects of these inter
ventions on client satisfaction with maternal and neo
natal healthcare Implementation of CDSS in the
context of an ongoing PBI intervention in Upper East
Region provided an opportunity to examine perceived
effects of both interventions among health workers as
we found no other qualitative studies on this topic and
research had shown sub optimal motivation and perfor
mance among maternal and neonatal healthcare provid
ers in these areas and potential scope for improvement
This qualitative study thus aimed to explore
health worker perspectives of the effects of CDSS in the
context of a combined CDSS PBI intervention on mater
nal and child healthcare provision in primary facilities in
Ghana s Upper East Region
Methods
Study design and sites
This qualitative study reanalyses semi structured
interviews conducted with frontline health workers
facility managers and district supervisors at the end of
the European Union funded Quality of maternal and
neonatal health QUALMAT intervention trial
This cluster randomized un blinded controlled trial
conducted in Ghana s Upper East region aimed to assess
Aninanya et al BMC Health Services Research
the effect of a CDSS for maternal and neonatal health
care services
The trial was conducted in twelve health facilities in
Kassena Nankana KND and Builsa districts and is
described in Aninanya et al KND intervention dis
trict has an estimated population of served by
one hospital in the district capital Navrongo six health
centres one private clinic and twenty seven Commu
nity based Health Planning and Services CHPS com
pounds Builsa comparison district has an estimated
population of served by the district hospital in
Sandema six health centres and thirteen CHPS com
pounds MNH services were considered poor in Upper
East Region due to insufficient and demotivated staff
inadequate access to and use of computers reproductive
health guidance and protocols and inadequate diagno
ses and referrals A cross sectional study of
new mothers indicated had delivered in health facili
ties and had received antenatal care with having
four or more antenatal visits However institutional
MMR in the Upper East Region prior to the trial was
per live births and estimated at and per
live births In KND and Builsa district respec
tively Nurses and midwives are responsible for pro
vision of facility based MNH services in these districts
with low productivity reported as some provid
ers rarely used treatment guidelines or partograph and
missed health education opportunities
CDSS and PBI interventions were implemented in six
KND intervention facilities for two years
CDSS included computerized clinical support in imple
menting WHO Pregnancy Childbirth Postpartum and
Newborn Care a guide for essential practice guidelines
for purposively selected and trained midwives com
munity health nurses and facility managers Each inter
vention facility received a laptop with CDSS software
and IT support shared between three trained midwives
and nurses while facility managers were tasked with
supervision
Performance was rewarded based on improvements
within facilities rather than in comparison to other
facilities Individuals were identified for P Bls based on
achieving key indicators determined by facility leader
ship regional and district health directorates and the
PBI committee PBI consisted of rewarding best per
forming midwives and facilities with domestic appliances
e g blenders fans stoves freezers fridges televisions
saucepans cloths kettles microwaves and recogni
tion certificates at annual awards ceremonies along with
regular supervision verbal appreciation furniture and
small monthly allowances Key performance
indicators included proportion of ANC visits recorded in
CDSS proportions of pregnant women receiving tetanus
Page of
vaccination iron supplementation safe sex and HIV
counselling proportion of births attended by skilled per
sonnel proportion of partographs completed in CDSS
partograph usage rate proportion of women referred
based on CDSS recommendation and proportion of
newborns vaccinated
Sampling and recruitment
We included all participating CDSS users facil
ity managers and district level staff in intervention
facilities and used purposive non probability sampling
to select equal numbers of equivalent participants in
comparison facilities This enabled us to include non
intervention participants with similar workloads who
could provide relevant insights GAA obtained written
informed consent from all participants before interview
Data collection
We developed an interview guide from the literature and
expert opinion Topics included basic demographics
experiences of CDSS and PBI interventions if relevant
work challenges and suggested solutions GAA and two
research assistants conducted in person audio recorded
interviews in English lasting min in locations
such as homes and health facilities as chosen by partici
pants We used interviews with facility managers and
district level staff because of their varied involvement
supervising the intervention to triangulate and crystalize
findings from frontline providers To ensure confidential
ity we assigned identification codes and did not include
personal identifiers in study tools or outputs Audio
files were transcribed verbatim by two professional
transcriptionists
Analysis
GAA imported transcripts into Nvivo QSR Interna
tional Pty Ltd Victoria Australia data management soft
ware and analysed them thematically using Braun
and Clarke s six stage approach In summary GAA
read and became familiarised with the data identified
deductive codes based on interview guide topics and
inductively coded new or unexpected topics arising in
transcripts She developed a coding structure iteratively
collating codes related to intervention effects challenges
and suggestions into themes GAA examined relation
ships between codes compiled and summarised con
tents of each theme with support from co authors and
conducted thematic mapping GAA and NH refined and
defined themes and sub themes through discussion fur

Results
Participant characteristics and analytical themes
In all participants were included in the study in
intervention and in comparison facilities Most
were women were maternal healthcare providers i e
Page of
It has helped me to know more Especially if you
are educating an ANC woman you can just educate
the woman without cracking your brains Ihe infor
mation we get from the CDSS to educate the women
has helped improve the quality of care Midwife
years intervention arm
Generally while several noted that it could not replace
skilled midwifery decision making most noted that they
each intervention and comparison were facil
were pleased to get reminders
ity managers i e each intervention and comparison
and were district level staff i e intervention and
comparison
We organised findings under three deductive themes
of perceived CDSS PBI effects on provider performance
challenges to CDSS use and suggestions for improv
ing provider performance We reported perceptions of
frontline and managerial participants in intervention and
control facilities separately and included inductive sub
themes as appropriate
CDSS PBI effects on provider performance
All intervention participants indicated CDSS PBI
interventions had enhanced performance Reportedly
MNH care providers knowledge of maternal health
issues increased and quality of care improved CDSS
helped guide diagnoses and prescribing prompting
health workers on necessary actions in managing routine
care and pregnancy related complications Three induc
tive sub themes were i reminders and health education
support ii improved performance and iii improved
clinical processes and outcomes
Reminders and health education support
Midwives and nurses generally appreciated the automatic
reminders such as to provide deworming drugs
It alerts us on what to do and because of that we
can do things For the Albendazole deworming
that one if you have not given to the woman and you
are entering it will ask you whether you have given
the drug It has affected IPT intermittent pre
ventive treatment for malaria because the way the
book is sometimes you can forget that the person
has not taken IPT but the computer will alert you
Midwife years intervention arm
I will say the quality of maternal care has
improved We are now prompted to administer cer
tain drugs like Albendazole Midwife years
intervention arm
Similarly many frontline providers noted how useful it
was having key messages and educational information at
their fingertips
I t will be alerting you on what to do So I will say
it guides us on what to do and how to do but before
you have to make your own decision Midwife
years intervention arm
Improved performance
Several frontline health workers described being
more efficient or better performing their duties Some
described this in relation to CDSS
It CDSS has affected antenatal coverage because
you are able to attend to more clients in a day
Sometimes we attend to about women in a day
Midwife years intervention arm
Performance has improved in the sense that if you
open the and the registers you will see
a vast difference Now we check all the HB haemo
globin of the clients and we also counsel them a lot
Also if the woman comes and she is weeks the
computer will tell you what to do since it is pre term
labou Medical Assistant years intervention
arm
Many described improvements in relation to P Bls and
increased motivation
I work hard since I know it will pay off by not only
improving quality of care but something small from
the project Midwife intervention facility
Some midwives also related P Bls to improving their job
satisfaction as well as performance
I like the performance based package because when
I perform well I am awarded I get inner satisfac
tion Ihat helps me to give my best Midwife inter
ventionfacility
Managers with access to aggregated data described
similar perspectives
Ihe interventions CDSS PBI have contributed
to improved performance because the midwife is
more committed to work She barely even leaves the
maternity and I think it has even increased some of
Aninanya et al BMC Health Services Research
the indicators and deliveries over the past few years
Our facility has contributed significantly to the dis
trict performance which has been recognized by the
district lhere has been an improvement in anti tet
anus vaccinations to pregnant women and intermit
tent preventive treatment I realized that previously
there were issues child welfare and Penta
but I think over the past years there has been an
improvement Medical Assistant years male
intervention arm
Several managers also noted benefits of PBIs particu
larly in terms of midwives motivation to work more
actively
Performance based incentives have made them
happy It shows that they are working You know
they had certificates they had parcels This has
made them very happy and they are doing the work
It has made them to do the work more and more
Facility manager intervention facility
Improved clinical processes and outcomes
Most described improved work processes with some
describing this as improving quality of care while others
referred to improving MNH outcomes including mortal
ity For example a district manager referred to CDSS as
their new doctor
Ihe computer also has all the protocols so because
this district we don t have a doctor the computer is
now our doctor Ihe computer guides us The nurse
doesn t panic because the computer tells them what
to do District Public Health Nurse years inter
vention arm
Frontline providers similarly described how protocols
and reminders improved clinical processes for them
With the CDSS if a client s BP blood pressure is
high it will ask you to recheck and if it is still high
it will ask you to do something for the client either
you refer or detain With the paper based protocols
most often you just skip these vital things CDSS also
makes it easy to access previous patient s history
Midwife years Intervention arm
For PNC postnatal care after delivery you have to
check the woman frequently min min h for
h and at the end you can know the woman is now
well Midwife years intervention arm
Many health workers connected process improve
ments with improved maternal outcomes either through
Page of
women receiving all required services and treatments or
through encouraging earlier referrals
It has reduced maternal deaths because if a woman
comes and you monitor to a certain level the CDSS
will just tell you to refer and so it makes us to refer
early Midwife years intervention arm
Municipal and district managers had similar perspec
tives on the advantages of CDSS As one noted
with the paper based protocols they are mostly in
their cabinets and not on their tables and that make
them feel lazy using them but this one makes you
alert as you are entering the data while reviewing
the protocol Without the protocol some even refer
cases that they are not supposed to refer Ihe CDSS
has improved the midwives knowledge and helps
them refer clients early Quality of maternal health
care has improved because you don t do things in the
abstract Municipal Public Health Nurse years
intervention arm
Several managers also described specific benefits of
PBIs As another noted
Health workers were behaving negatively towards
work but the PBI intervention has come to improve
on it For the first time it was introduced they were
not serious because they didn t know there will be
awards but when the first award ceremony came
they became serious and when they go to work they
are actually busy District Public Health Nurse
years intervention arm
Challenges to CDSS use
Alongside perceived improvements intervention par
ticipants described challenges in using CDSS Some
appeared relatively easily addressable such as software
requiring administration of only one malaria IPT to preg
nant women and increased workloads as nurses and mid
wives still had to complete facility forms in addition to
CDSS data screens Others were more challenging such
as faulty electronic partograph leading to unnecessary
referrals and power fluctuations affecting software use
The IPT gap was a common complaint
are certain things in the CDSS that should be
improved Ihe IPT should be first second and third
It s only once in the CDSS Midwife years inter
vention arm
Most frontline health workers found it annoying and
time consuming to complete both CDSS data screens
and paper documentation
Aninanya et al BMC Health Services Research
It has also increased our workload because we have
to use the computer and attend to the woman and
at the same time enter it into the book Midwife
years intervention facility
Some midwives suggested that maternity clients also
found this annoying
Ihe only complaint they clients give is that they
keep long because you enter their personal infor
mation into the maternal book and afterwards you
enter the same information into the CDSS Mid
wife years intervention arm
Some also suggested that added form filling distracted
from patient care
In fact to use the computer to monitor a patient is
sometimes difficult it doesn t need one person Ifa
woman is in labour you can t come to the computer
again Midwife years intervention arm
Many health workers noted that the CDSS partograph
required too many referrals
If you want to follow the partographs strictly on the
CDSS you will end up referring all your delivery cli
ents Midwives years intervention arm
All noted that CDSS equipment s short battery life and
reliance on electricity could be problematic
Sometimes too if there is light out and the battery
is down you can t use it for patient care Midwife
years intervention arm
Suggestions for improving provider performance
Other than addressing the issues highlighted above sug
gestions for improving performance came from com
parison arm participants Interestingly all comparison
participants reported some performance improvements
the study was not blinded but noted considerable need
for further improvement However when asked whether
they knew anything about CDSS or PBIs or how these
worked most said no and were thus not questioned fur
ther about the intervention Instead the issues they dis
cussed were primarily about the challenges they faced in
their work and how these could be addressed Despite
their lack of reported knowledge all comparison health
workers requested PBIs along with more promotion
opportunities and staff to spread the workload and
described the need for protocols phone based guide
lines and equipment e g test kits blood pressure appa
ratus haemoglobin machines to enhance their work
lhere is a slight improvement in performance but
there is still more room for improvement Protocols
Page of
and incentives that are supposed to enhance our
performance are inadequate Midwife years
comparison arm
Comparison area managers reiterated frontline per
spectives with poor partograph use in comparison facili
ties highlighted
Performance is moderate because we don t have
the requisite protocols in the facility to make clini
cal decisions Partograph utilization is poor in most
cases Community health offcer years compar

Generally the performance of nurses is encour
aging Although some indicators have declined it
is still not bad Partograph utilization is poor but

good based on the statistics District Health Infor
mation Offcer years comparison arm
All comparison health workers advocated for access to
CDSS
Authorities should introduce electronic decision
support systems to enhance patient based care
Midwife years comparison arm
Comparison managers expressed the same wish to have
the CDSS PBI intervention in their facilities
All facilities should have computers where the pro
viders can also learn new protocols in maternal and
neonatal health services through the internet Ihey
should be trained on how to use these computers
to monitor labour and they should be given finan
Cial package District health information offcer

I will suggest improved logistics and human
resources provision of financial package to both
clients and workers to boost their morale District

Discussion
This qualitative study examined frontline and mana
gerial perspectives of CDSS combined with a PBI
intervention indicating perceived improvements in
health worker performance and conditions as com
pared to comparison arm counterparts CDSS appeared
to enhance provider knowledge of maternal health
issues and health education messaging support care
provision through reminders and protocols and
increase referrals This was despite baseline research
Aninanya et al BMC Health Services Research
suggesting very limited technological knowledge
among these providers Several intensive train
ings and supportive supervision equipped health work
ers with the necessary technical skills to use computers
for maternal care as also shown in Canada This
reinforces research findings on the benefits of CDSS for
MNH provider performance and implies that
contributions to achieving SDG and universal health
coverage UHC could invest in such interventions
to enhance health worker performance
Comparison area participants on the contrary
reported commensurately smaller improvements with
suggestions for additional changes that likely related
to other simultaneous MNH initiatives in Upper
East region Interestingly suggestions for
improvement were all from comparison facilities and
despite indicating their lack of awareness of CDSS and
P Bls they expressed considerable interest This sug
gests that the concepts of CDSS and P Bls were quite
popular with or without explicit knowledge of either
intervention It is thus worth noting that comparison
participants recommended CDSS PBI intervention
components be introduced in their facilities to
further improve performance e g protocols on their
mobile phones incentives along with essential sup
plies and equipment such as test kits blood pressure
apparatus This supports evidence from other settings
on the perceived benefits of CDSS and P Bls to improve
performance
While it was not possible to confirm the maternal mor
tality improvements reported by participants recent evi
dence showed this intervention improved antenatal and
delivery clients satisfaction with care Increased
satisfaction suggests services attitudes or both had
improved Additionally use of relevant clinical
guidelines was reportedly high among intervention
health workers while earlier research in the area showed
this as poor Thus improved access to and
required use of clinical protocols and guidelines as part
of CDSS in intervention facilities likely meant improved
quality of care and reduced clinical errors as indicated
in other research on use of computerized guidelines to
reduce errors and epidemiological research in Ghana
and other LMICs
What this study does show is that despite some oper
ational challenges e g software glitches electricity
health workers reported job satisfaction and quality of
care improved with the introduction of the CDSS PBI
intervention This is promising though further research
is needed on intervention cost effectiveness and sus
tainability before any policy decision should be taken on
wider implementation

Strengths and limitations
The study fills a gap in knowledge as there are no stud
ies on the combined effects of these interventions on
health workers care providers performance How
ever several limitations should be considered when
interpreting the findings First while the focus was on
CDSS both CDSS and PBI were running concurrently
it was not feasible to assess the two intervention com
ponents separately Second the qualitative results pre
sent just the perceptions of health professionals with
regards to the intervention a mixed method approach
would have created an opportunity to collect both
qualitative and quantitative data at the same time and
would have offset weaknesses associated with using one
method
Conclusion
Findings indicated predominantly positive perceptions of
the CDSS PBI intervention helped improve MNH care
provider performance in the Upper East Region CDSS
and P Bls have potential to improve frontline health
workers motivation and adherence to clinical guidelines
However while this combined intervention shows prom
ise for longer term or wider implementation context
and perspectives must be considered when developing
implementing and assessing any performance improve
ment intervention Thus further research is still required
to assess the cost effectiveness and sustainability of per
formance improvements

Abstract
Objective
To determine the clinical manifestations risk factors
and maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant and
recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed
coronavirus disease covid
DESIGN
Living systematic review and meta analysis
DATA SOURCES
Medline Embase Cochrane database WHO COVID
database China National Knowledge Infrastructure
CNKI and Wanfang databases from December
to April along with preprint servers
social media and reference lists
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Pregnant women are considered to be a high risk group for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus SARS CoV infection and the potential
adverse effects of the virus on maternal and perinatal outcomes are of concern
In non pregnant populations admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease
covid the most common symptoms are fever cough and dyspnoea
reported in more than two thirds of individuals
Advancing age high body mass index non white ethnicity and pre existing
comorbidities are risk factors for severe covid in the general population
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid diagnosed in hospital are
less likely to manifest symptoms of fever cough dyspnoea and myalgia than
non pregnant women of reproductive age
Pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid are at increased risk of
admission to an intensive care unit receiving invasive ventilation or death
compared with non pregnant women of reproductive age with covid
Risk factors for severe disease in pregnancy include increasing maternal age
high body mass index non white ethnicity pre existing comorbidities and
pregnancy specific disorders such as gestational diabetes and pre eclampsia
Pregnant women with covid are more likely to experience preterm birth and
their neonates are more likely to be stillborn or admitted to a neonatal unit
Pregnant women with covid had an absolute risk increase for admission to
intensive care unit preterm birth caesarean section and admission of their
neonates to neonatal unit compared with pregnant women without covid

diabetes high maternal age and high body mass
index are risk factors for severe covid outcomes
in pregnancy Pregnant women with covid versus
without covid are more likely to deliver preterm

be updated to reflect emerging evidence Updates
may occur for up to two years from the date of
original publication This version is update of the

Introduction
Since the first report December of the novel
coronavirus disease covid caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
SARS CoV the number of confirmed cases and
associated mortality and morbidity have increased
rapidly Pregnant women are considered a high
risk group because of concerns about the effect of
covid on them during and after pregnancy and
on their neonates Quantification of the rates of
covid its risk factors clinical manifestations and
outcomes is key to planning clinical maternal care and
management in an evolving pandemic scenario
Publications on covid in pregnancy have risen
steeply through individual case reports case series
observational studies and systematic reviews Since
the publication of our original living systematic
review on covid in pregnancy over reviews
have been published in this area
with many more
registered in PROSPERO
Early reviews mostly
included case reports and case series that were often
inappropriately meta analysed providing biased
estimates Subsequent reviews differed little from
each other often including similar primary studies
many with duplicate data These reviews became
quickly outdated as new evidence emerged Moreover
the sampling frames in primary studies have varied
ranging from universal SARS CoV testing for all
pregnant women admitted to hospital
to symptom
based testing
Testing strategies have also differed
within and between countries with diagnosis in
many early studies based on epidemiological risk
assessment and clinical features without confirmed
SARS CoV infection which need to be considered in
the analysis Limitations in the external and internal
validity of studies make it challenging for guideline
developers and policy makers to make evidence based
recommendations for the management of pregnant
and recently pregnant women with covid
We started this living systematic review in April
to determine the clinical manifestations of covid in
pregnant and recently pregnant women identify the
risk factors for complications and quantify maternal
and perinatal outcomes The systematic review is being
updated on a regular basis
Methods
Our systematic review is based on a prospectively
registered protocol PROSPERO
registered April to evaluate a series of
research questions on covid during and after
pregnancy We report our findings on the rates
clinical manifestations risk factors and maternal and
perinatal outcomes in women with covid in line with
the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews
and meta analyses PRISMA recommendations
see appendix As more relevant data become
available we shall answer other research questions
in our published protocol Each cycle of our living
systematic review involves weekly search updates
rounds with analysis performed every months
for reporting through a dedicated website with early
analysis if new definitive evidence emerges We are
regularly reviewing the planned frequency of updates
Literature search
Our weekly search update included a systematic
search of major databases Medline Embase Cochrane
database WHO World Health Organization COVID
database China National Knowledge Infrastructure
CNKI and Wanfang databases for relevant studies
on covid in pregnant and recently pregnant
women We also coordinated our search efforts with
the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and
Co ordinating Centre EPPI Centre WHO Library and
Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility group Additional
searches were conducted of preprint servers blogs
websites that serve as repositories for covid studies
such as the LOVE platform Living Overview of the
Evidence
social media guidelines and reference
lists of included studies For this second update of
the review we included studies from searches up to
April We contacted established groups that
were coordinating or conducting surveillance and

Study selection
Two reviewers independently selected studies using
a two stage process they first screened the titles
and abstracts of studies and then assessed the full
text of the selected studies in detail for eligibility A
total of reviewers contributed to study selection
Disagreements were resolved through discussion
with a third reviewer ST or JA We excluded studies
if the duplicated data for all outcomes of interest were
published elsewhere as reported by the study authors
or when the characteristics of the women or neonates
matched the setting characteristics and duration of
another study from the same geographical location If
there was an overlap of data or suspicion of duplicates
of participants in studies we included studies based on
their study design prioritising comparative cohorts
and sample size larger study prioritised
We defined women as having confirmed covid
if they had laboratory confirmation of SARS CoV
infection irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms
Women with a diagnosis based only on clinical or
radiological findings were defined as having suspected
covid The recently pregnant group comprised
women in the postpartum and post abortion period We
included studies that compared covid rates clinical
manifestations symptoms laboratory and radiological
results risk factors and associated mortality and
morbidity between pregnant and recently pregnant
and non pregnant women of reproductive age and
those that compared maternal and perinatal outcomes
in pregnant women with and without covid In
studies comparing maternal and perinatal outcomes
of pregnant women with covid to those without we
classified the comparative controls as being historical
if the cohort of pregnant women without covid
gave birth before December Studies on non
comparative cohorts with a minimum of participants
were included if they reported on the rates and clinical
manifestations of covid and relevant outcomes in
pregnant and recently pregnant women We defined
cohort studies as those that sampled participants on
the basis of exposure followed up participants over
time and ascertained the outcomes The PROSPERO
protocol provides a full list of the risk factors clinical
features and outcomes evaluated
The sampling frames for detecting covid included
universal screening and testing when all women were
assessed for covid using reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction RT PCR for SARS CoV
chest computed tomography or antigen detection

and symptom based
testing when testing was only performed on women
with symptoms and those with a history of contact
with affected individuals We defined the population
as being selected when only specific groups of women
were included such as those undergoing caesarean
section or in the third trimester We categorised studies
as a high risk group if only women with any pre existing
medical or obstetric risk factors were included low risk
if women did not have any risk factors and any risk if
all women were included
Study quality assessment and data extraction
The quality of the comparative cohort studies was
assessed for selection comparability and outcome
ascertainment bias using the Newcastle Ottawa
scale Studies achieving four stars for selection two
for comparability and three for ascertainment of the
outcome were considered to have a low risk of bias
Studies achieving two or three stars for selection one
for comparability and two for outcome ascertainment
were considered to have a medium risk of bias
and any study achieving one star for selection or
outcome ascertainment or
