 and religious beliefs hindered the use of modern
methods of contraceptive Undesirable attitudes of service providers influenced underutilisation of family
planning services Ineffective contraceptive choice counselling particularly for poor section of the community
and high risk groups were reported While considering inter pregnancy interval some of the women opted for
induced abortion to terminate unplanned pregnancy however had meagre acceptance for using modern con
traceptive methods
Conclusioru The findings call for reinvigorated efforts to provide effective and individually religiously regionally
and culturally appropriate interventions to improve family planning access and ultimately support better health
and rights of women in India
India a densely and second highest populated country in the world
is in a phase of demographic and epidemiological transition To control
its rising population India felt an urgency of Family Planning FP
program in and became one of the first countries to launch the
National Programme for Family Planning NPFP Since its launch
the NPFP has undergone various policy and implementation modifica
tions and currently operating as part of Reproductive Maternal
Newborn and Child Health and Adolescents Program RMNCAH In
the initial period of NPFP the emphasis was on natural methods e g
rhythm method subsequently the focus shifted on modern methods of
contraception such as condoms diaphragms and intra uterine devices

Over the years India has made progress in FP related indicators e
g reduction in fertility rate from in to in
Despite this achievement India is still distant in achieving some of the
targets laid down by the SDG i e satisfying the of the total de
mand by use of modern FP methods The unmet FP needs among In
dian women especially belonging to lower socio economic strata are
high About married and all women years use any
type of contraceptive and married and all women
years use modern contraceptive methods Among these women within
one year of use the discontinuation rate of contraceptives was high
which are related to multiple factors Compared to male sterilisation
and temporary modern contraceptives female sterilisation accounting
to of women between and years of age is the most preferred
approaches of limiting the family size The number of female steri
lisations carried out per annum is also higher as compared to other
countries In the unintended pregnancy rate in India was per
women years and one third of all the pregnancies ended in
induced abortions Furthermore the health facility survey conducted in
six Indian states reported that there were million abortions with a
rate of abortions per women in reproductive age group
By addressing FP needs more than of low and middle income
country s child deaths and morbidity associated with abortion and
pregnancy could be avoided
Considering this the govern
ment of India is committed to enhancing the demand for modern
reversible contraceptives use to among married women

To highlight commonalities or dissimilarities it is important to
collate and summarise the opinion and perspectives of people belonging
to a wider group or context on a complex phenomenon To the best of
our knowledge there are no qualitative systematic reviews conducted
on the resident Indian population that studied perceptions of FP Pre
vious qualitative systematic reviews conducted elsewhere were focused
on a subset of population such as age group provider or country
Therefore the present qualitative systematic review was designed to
explore personal experiences and perceptions of and on women about FP
in India This review will fill the gap by accounting for the experiences
expectations emotions needs opinions and feelings of resident Indian
women on the FP which will further help guide policies and frame FP
interventions in India

studies that studied the experience or perceptions were
included In case of mixed methods studies only results of
qualitative analysis were considered
Studies that probed the experiences and or opinions on family
planning and related issues such as barriers or facilitators of
contraception use were included For the purpose of this
systematic review family planning was operationalised in
accordance with the World Health Organization as a
conscious effort of couple to limit childbirths or have
appropriate inter pregnancy interval using temporary or
permanent contraceptive methods Additionally we
considered studies that discussed treatment of involuntary
infertility
Women irrespective of age and fertility status in
reproductive age groups living in India were included
Additionally perception of husbands mothers and mothers
in law if provided in the study were captured to address
pluralism Men or mothers in law s opinion supplemented the
information in generating the similarities or dissimilarities in
women s opinion Nevertheless we excluded the study if it
was exclusively focused on men or healthcare providers In the
case of a mixed population we extracted perceptions of the
population of our interest Additionally we considered studies
undertaken on people living with HIV drug users and women
undergoing abortion if it was focused on phenomena of our
interest or had described at least one theme subtheme of
family planning Studies conducted in other countries among
Indian women such as American Indian were excluded
Journal publications theses dissertations reports books or

We included studies published in English
Selection of studies
EndNote x was used to manage the data and Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet for screening Two authors PH SSP screened citations by
their titles and abstracts independently Full text screening was un
dertaken independently by PH SSP and VSD in two groups Any dis
agreements between the authors on a decision to include the articles
were resolved by discussions until consensus within and between
groups
Data extraction
A data extraction sheet was prepared and extraction was carried out
by PH SSP and VSD independently in pairs Disagreements if any on
extracted data were resolved by discussions within and between the
pairs The extracted data included study identifiers data collection
methodology study location contextual details of participants and
qualitative data of phenomena themes and quotes
Data analysis
We undertook manual thematic analysis to analyse the qualitative
data
SSP read the extracted data multiple times and generated
the coding frame Quotations reported in included studies were read and
deciphered to get a deeper understanding of the data Each study was
examined for consistencies dissimilarities and contradictions in the
perceptions or experiences to generate a new wider understanding of
the phenomena without altering the originality of the primary data
S S Parsekar et al
The coding scheme enabled the systematic identification of analytic
patterns and theoretically important concepts SSP and PH further dis
cussed these codes refined them by rereading the study if needed and
grouped the codes after reaching consensus Subsequently repeated
occurring codes were synthesised and classified into overarching
themes which led to the development of thematic framework Within
each theme we described the content and meaning of the data extracted
from included studies To confirm trustworthiness the emerging themes
were re examined by all the authors Subsequently we prepared the
final list of themes through discussion and consensus A theme appear
ing in more than one paper does not justify the intensity of data validity
Therefore study references within a specific theme are reported To
summarise and explain the linkages between the themes and subthemes
we utilised the World Health Organization WHO conceptual frame

Discussion
To our best knowledge this qualitative systematic review is the first
one conducted to collate the evidence to inform on perceptions and
experiences of women about FP in India Findings highlights that the
multiple determinants influenced women s intent of using FP services or
methods These determinants can be linked to improving the unmet FP
needs and SRH and rights in conformity with the SDGs and
Although review participants were in favour of getting married after
years some women were married parous or pregnant before
attaining the legal age of marriage and years for women and men
in India respectively As per a national survey conducted in India
there were a significant proportion of adolescent years women
who were married and pregnant or parous in the year
This is a major concern especially for India considering
the effect of adolescent pregnancy and childbirth on MCH Early mar
riages are often associated with higher fertility rate early childbearing
practices shorter birth intervals and decreased knowledge and access to
FP methods
Marriage brings numerous responsibilities to women and women
are expected to perform in an ideal way as defined by societal pressure
and in laws expectations It is a cultural notion especially in India that
marriage is not only a union of two people but also a union of two
families Additionally marriage embarks on the societal and familial
expectation of initiating a childbearing and childrearing But soon after
marriage women are at the forefront to take the entire responsibility to
prove their womanhood and receive respect from the family and society
by being fertile and childbearing if not there was a threat for experi
encing discrimination and divorce
Most of our participants were not or minimally educated and had low
socio economic status The majority of the participants were favouring
small family size and were well versed with its benefits including
reduced financial burden MCH and other responsibilities associated
with child rearing The finding is congruent with existing evidence of
importance of investing in FP Nonetheless almost one fourth of the
studies reported that having a son was one of the prime factors for
influencing FP decision making Reasons for son preference were

Social policies As per government order Baiga
community in Chhattisgarh denied access to
family planning FP services as a result women
had multiple pregnancies which deteriorated
health Because of this women visited nearby
states to avail FP services or they hide gave up
their cultural identity
Some of the cultural and societal values related
to FP timing number gender of child were
mythic and women couple follow these norms
willingly However some participants presumed
that they do not have choice but to oblige
societal and family pressure Some norms are
specific to indigenous Muslim or Hindu family
Sub themes under this are described further
Women perceived the ideal age for marriage to be
years After marriage society expected woman
to be ideal wife and mother and women
perceived that it was their duty to fulfil these
expectations Women expressed that they were
expected to be sexually available for husbands
Husband s dominance in sexuality and women s
submissiveness were commonly reported Threats
from husband about re marriage were reported
Although polygamy among tribal was not
common it increases the fertility prospects
Also tribal population accepted the pre marital
sex and relationships as well as childbearing
However discussion on sex was a taboo and need
for sex education was discussed
Women perceived that it was the social obligation
to have their first child soon after marriage There
were different reported reasons for the same viz
Familial and societal pressure community
judgement and proving womanhood If a woman
has a child soon after marriage her social status
respect from society and family improves
Some women also shared threat of abandonment
if they don t have a child after marriage
Participants also shared consequences of
infertility
Family planning FP and culture FP is culturally
not acceptable in some culture Participants were
influenced by faith healers who discouraged FP
Participants avoid talking about family planning
because of shame or embarrassment Sterilisation
was not acceptable and barren woman s
prospect of going for levirate marriage decreased
Some other tribal practices were also discussed
which prevented women going for FP
Family planning and religion It was found that
people s volition in contraceptive use or sterilisation
was a sin Participants voiced that tribes were
banned from worshiping after sterilisation and
Islam forbids contraception or sterilisation They
often felt that it was God s wish in deciding the
number and timing of children Some also
expressed that if a woman was sterilised she was
considered impure for the last rites
Most participants expressed timing of childbearing
to be soon after marriage because it gives them
feeling of incompleteness Some felt it should be

delayed and others expressed it should be
depending on the age of the women
Sex composition and preference Only a subset of
women did not prefer a particular gender of the
child while others expressed to have one girl and
a boy Those who expressed girl preference felt
that girls are useful for instrumental help and they
get bride price Girl aversion was common
considering the dowry practice in India Son
preference was predominantly seen and was
determined by number of children economic
and social benefits family name and old age
support
Concept of family size and spacing varied between
studies Small family norm was expressed
considering the economic benefits future
prospects maternal and child health However
others felt having multiple children were useful
while some others left it on God s wish HIV
status of parents was also important predictor of
deciding the family size
Women s agency in terms of choice having
ability to opt for FP voice capacity to assert
one s interest and power in constraining or
enabling voice and choice is influenced by
multiple factors In contrast to younger
adolescent or youth and not less educated
women older women are more likely to have a
steady stand and decision of timing and number
of children Older women were more inclined to
use permanent sterilisation methods
Furthermore abuse from the husband threats
of divorce separation and remarriage made
women submissive to the men s decision on FP
Male dominance influence of mother in law and
women s submissive behaviour were commonly
reported by the included studies that were
hindering the socio economic position of
women However it was women s responsibility
to use the contraceptive methods and there was
resistance from men to use condom or male
sterilisation
Women who had strong premarital agency
agency here is a general concept and not
restricted to FP or who were older in age tended
to have better decision making power and they
were found to delay their marriage and
childbearing for career or education Other
socio demographic factors were employment
education age of women described in section
and husband s employment status Some
expressed joint decision making however
majority expressed it as male dominance Mother
in law s involvement in FP decision making is
strongly rooted in Indian culture Participants
reported female centric nature of contraception
and lack of involvement of husbands in FP
counselling or discussions
Women were aware of contraceptive methods but
were not aware of their proper use and were
found to be mostly using sterilisation rhythm
method and injectable Others were not aware of
reversible contraceptives other than abstinence FP
information was often sought from friends of the
same gender Accredited Social Health Activist or
were influenced by healthcare providers and
media Women had limited access to FP
information and expressed further need for
information Lack of awareness on FP was also
found among husbands Women s education
influenced use of FP Education and occupation
are interlinked and are related to economic
standing of the women Educated women may
have better access to information which in turn
help in making an informed decision making on
FP

Themes
Subthemes Categories
Women expressed desire to use contraception
but often left with no choice As a result they
were left with anxiety of pregnancy or tried
different tactics to avoid pregnancy such as going
to their natal house or subversive avoidance of
sexual intercourse coming to bed late and secretly
using FP methods
In line with the conceptual framework we
identified multiple intermediary determinants of
health Fear of side effects of reversible
contraceptives was one of the major
psychological barriers of using FP methods
Health status of women or of first born HIV
status of women or husband and history of drug
addiction influenced decision on use of FP
Furthermore access availability of healthcare
facilities and attitude of healthcare professionals
were documented Two conditions on which
people were deciding to take a call on the FP
methods or choices were family size achieved
and inter pregnancy interval When desired
family size was achieved participants either
opted for sterilisation or induced abortion
Whereas to achieve a desired inter pregnancy
interval family opted for contraceptives or
induced abortion This finding also suggests that
participants opted for induced abortion to
terminate unplanned pregnancy to limit the
number of children or spacing between the
pregnancies
Fertility intention among HIV positive or drug
users were expressed The desired were based on
existing child dren or son preference pressure
from society wanted some reason to live and
positive reinforcement after antiretroviral therapy
Inconsistent condom use was reported among
HIV positive individuals Desire to have a child
also depended on health of the couple fear of HIV
transmission to child and future prospects
Women usually resorted to abortion as a means
to end unintended pregnancy to limit family size
or wanted to have spacing between childbirths
Some even opted for multiple induced abortions
Reasons were first child s health or women s
health resistance to use contraception domestic
violence economic reasons sex selective abortion
first child male conceived in the month of Adi in
Tamil Nadu pregnant with man having same gotra
Clan influence of astrology and were shameful
because of existing adolescent child However
others considered abortion as sin Abortion
among unmarried was also reported The easy
accessibility of healthcare services was reported to
go for abortion Women desired confidentiality
while resorting to abort the child Some women
also reported unprofessional methods of
abortion
As a result of not conceiving soon after marriage
women sought advice and treatment from faith
healers and unqualified healthcare providers
Women believed in fate spirits witchcraft or the
evil eye that determined their ability to
conceive Faced embarrassment at the idea of
seeking treatment for infertility Information
access cost availability accessibility waiting
time navigating healthcare facilities and
unavailability of trained staff were some of the
factors to avail the healthcare services It also
dependent on familiarity of healthcare staff
Participants were discouraged by false
commitments or threats indifferent attitude of

size completion and was considered as necessary
and inevitable one time no fear of pregnancy
once the family size is complete Women
expressed fear of side effects and
misconceptions cumbersome to use irreversible
modern contraceptives Male sterilisation was not
a favoured option as it was considered to cause
loss of vitality or impotency Some considered
contraceptives or sterilisation use against their
religion There was lack of information on use
disposal access and cost of condoms
Participants felt condoms hinders sexual
pleasure and associated it with extra marital
sex Some participants trusted traditional or
natural methods of birth control such as coitus
interruptus rhythm method abstinence and sex
during menstruation These methods were
encouraged by faith healers and were simple
healthy and economical and had no side
effects
Our review participants comprehended inter pregnancy spacing in
tervals however intention of using contraceptives was not corre
sponded One of the major decision making factors for FP use was
husband s support but regrettably most of the women received meagre
support from husbands and mothers in law Majority of the women
complied with the husband s decision but some women took the risk of
going against the family s decision and secretly resorted to using con
traceptives and as a result lived with a fear of getting caught Women
remain at socially disadvantaged positions due to gender inequality and
lack of decision making power related to number and timing of child
birth FP not only addresses the unmet contraceptive needs but also
helps in overcoming gender equity and equality and growth of the in
dividual society and country
There were misconceptions about using FP methods in general
across the country disapproval regarding religious and socio cultural
norms and paradox related to men s attitude Similar findings were re
ported by reviews conducted among and younger than years
aged women Furthermore we found that female sterilisation was the
most utilised method of contraception once the desired family size was
reached Aforesaid finding was consistent with Indian data wherein
female sterilisation accounted for three out of four modern contracep
tive uses Women s preference to use sterilisation could be due to fear
of using reversible methods of contraception and partly because of In
dia s history of FP programs Indian FP program through its inception
mostly focused on limiting the family size by encouraging women to
adopt permanent sterilisation methods Additionally history of coercive
male sterilisation during might have created a lasting fear among the
people Although the program received multiple modifications it is
deeply rooted in people s mind which may be the reason for favouring
female sterilisation Furthermore high female sterilisation might be
related to associated reasons of not favouring temporary modern con
traceptives as described below
Our review demonstrated the difficulties in complying with oral
contraceptive pill OCP regimen Participants associated the use of
condoms with extra marital sex commercial sex and sexual transmitted
diseases which hindered its use Women had lack of agency or control
over condom use as it was considered a male contraceptive Almost all
the studies reported fear of side effects of contraception due to prior
experience or heard from others especially IUDs and OCPs therefore
they were inclined to use traditional methods of contraception Similar
findings were reported by other reviews
In there were about
Indian women who had unmet contraceptive needs and women
practiced traditional methods of contraception
Some of our review participants opted for induced abortion for un
planned pregnancy as a result of unmet FP Inclination for induced

use
above or lack of awareness related to FP Our findings are compatible
with quantitative studies conducted in India and further provide the
perceptions of women for its inclination As discussed in the back
ground induced abortion is associated with adverse health condition as
well as social stigma due to which many women hide abortion history
Our review highlights the FP service use among drug addicts and
PLHIV The possible reason behind this could be effective contraceptive
choice counselling among high risk populations for preventing sexually
transmitted infections However the findings based on the general
population reported that condom use was considered as a barrier to
sexual pleasure This underscores the urgent need of a health literacy
program by developing both the skills and mind set about its proper
use One of the included studies in our review reported the atrocities
faced by indigenous people in Chhattisgarh due to FP policy change
government order Nevertheless it is important to note that
Chhattisgarh High Court quashed this order in as the order was
violating human rights
In general our review participants had credibility issues on gov
ernment health facilities due to various reasons such as the attitude of
the healthcare professionals which is coherent with the conflict theory
of decision making Similar to our findings accessibility economic
reasons social stigma and prejudices of healthcare providers were the
main reason for not accessing FP services However not utilising pro
fessional healthcare services eventually intensifies the risk of medical
complications
Gender of the attending doctor was found to be
another factor influencing utilisation of healthcare service in another
review but we did not come across any such finding in our review
Strengths and weakness
As our systematic review considered wider ethnic cultural and
geographic regions it increases the scope of taking a broader view of the
findings Additionally we have considered perceptions of men and
mothers in law to get an extensive representation Quantitative studies
often cannot find the underlying reasons for a particular outcome
nevertheless our review reduces the gap reported by by
comprehensively identifying the reasons for almost all the FP related
concepts in India Furthermore these reasons are explained using the
WHO framework for social determinates of health
Despite commonalities in overarching themes we cannot apply the
findings to population belonging to a higher socio economic stratum
because of paucity of data in this group of people Almost of In
dia s population reside in villages therefore findings can be general
ised to a larger population of the country We paid more importance to
the experiences and perceptions of people compared to the methodo
logical issues of the included studies Additionally we could not cate
gorise the studies based on study quality as measured using Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme checklist Additional file therefore we did
not use it while generating the findings of the review Most of the
included studies did not report qualitative methodologies appropriately
e g type of qualitative data details on analysis positionality and
reflexivity of researchers therefore we suggest future researchers to
follow standard reporting guidelines and report a methodology that is
reproducible Furthermore due to resource constraint we restricted the
studies to English language
Implications for policy and research
The ongoing programme RMNCAH focusing on SRH and rights in
India to be continued and may consider our findings in revising
approach for meeting the needs of target population The implications of
the current review findings are listed below
Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health
Information education and counselling behaviour change commu
a
nication Our review perpetuates that many perceptions and prac
tices associated with FP adoption were based on misconceptions and
traditional socio cultural beliefs Developing contextual behaviour
change strategies to address the misconceptions and traditional
socio cultural beliefs without hurting the cultural and religious
sentiments could be good approach to increase the awareness of
modern contraceptives and alleviate the psychological fears associ
ated with them An age appropriate culturally acceptable sex edu
cation along with improvement in access to FP services could help in
avoiding unintended and early pregnancy especially among
adolescent and young women A previous conducted review rec
ommended that counselling is an effective means of increasing the
uptake of contraceptive use especially when combined with ante
natal or postnatal care
b
Edutainment approach Delivering the key messages related to FP
using audio visuals and a story can be a strong media especially for
influencing illiterate population
Focusing on sexual and reproductive health and rights Interventions
c
directed on enhancing the uptake of FP methods can be improvised
by giving importance to the demand side uptake along with a choice
based approach with focus on SRH and rights
d
Life planning skills Context specific mandatory module on life
planning skills consisting of SRH and rights should be included in the
school curriculum
Community engagement There is a need for FP program designed
e
through the engagement of various influential stakeholders such as
faith healers informal healthcare providers high risk populations
and other influential stakeholders We highlight the importance of
woman s agency in FP and to involve community to enhance
women empowerment by effective awareness creation and shared
responsibility among all the stakeholders
f
Youth responsibility programmes Youth in India can be the biggest
assets in promoting propagating creating awareness and influ
encing with the help of modern technology mediums such as social
media the peers and society in using appropriate FP methods Cre
ation of youth responsibility programmes is the need of the hour
Healthcare strengthening There is need to increase the accessibility
g
availability and affordability of modern contraceptive use especially
considering the ongoing Covid pandemic which has disrupted
the entire healthcare system in the country
h
Human resource and capacity building India has a vast network of
accredited social health activists also known as ASHA whose ca
pacity can be improvised to deliver some of the contraceptives e g
condoms and OCPs to the needy population ASHA s can also be
trained to create awareness about FP Training and capacity building
of healthcare providers frontline health workers and ASHAs should
be carried out periodically The government can consider using
alternative systems of medicine practitioners especially in rural re
gions to deliver FP services
Innovative strategies and research Our findings suggest that condi
tional cash transfer monetary incentives for availing sterilisation
from the government health facility was not a motivating factor for
the uptake of sterilisation as the money provided was minimal and
was spent on medicines Therefore we suggest more research on to
identify culturally and economically viable methods to increase the
access to safe and voluntary FP as a basic human right Research
development should be a priority for meeting the people s needs
especially assessing the effectiveness of contraceptives that have low
risk of side effects and are cost effective

ABSTRACT
Equitable access to contraception is critical for reproductive autonomy Using cross sectional data from the
DocStyIes survey administered September October response rate we compared changes in family
planning related clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during the COVID pandemic
and assessed service provision issues among U S physicians whose practice provided family planning
services just before the pandemic About one fifth of those whose practices provided the following services or
strategies just before the pandemic discontinued these services during the pandemic long acting reversible
contraception LARC placement LARC removal providing or prescribing emergency contraceptive
pills ECPs in advance and reminding patients about contraception injections or LARC removal or
replacement Many practices not providing the following services or strategies just before the pandemic
initiated these services during the pandemic telehealth for contraception initiation telehealth for
contraception continuation and renewing contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit
While a smaller proportion of physicians reported service provision issues in the month before survey
completion than at any point during the pandemic about one third still reported fewer adult females seeking
care and technical challenges with telehealth Discontinuation of key family planning services
during the COVID pandemic may limit contraception access and impede reproductive autonomy Imple
menting healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the need for in person visits e g telehealth for
contraception providing or prescribing ECPs in advance may decrease disruptions in care Resources exist for
public health and clinical efforts to ensure contraception access during the pandemic

Although many of
these strategies reduce the need for in person visits clinic visits remain
necessary for LARC insertion and removal if desired by patients and
these services may be particularly impacted by the pandemic
Nevertheless evidence suggests the COVID pandemic has dis
rupted access to family planning services One survey found that one in
three U S women reported that contraceptive or other reproductive
health visits were delayed or cancelled or that they experienced chal

We sought to expand what is known about the
tices
effect of the pandemic on family planning service provision from the
perspectives of a broad range of U S physicians Using data from a web
based panel survey of primary care physicians pediatricians and
obstetrician gynecologists working in outpatient and inpatient settings
our objectives were to compare changes in family planning related
clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during
the pandemic and assess specific service provision issues experienced
during the pandemic
Methods
We analyzed cross sectional data from the Fall DocStyIes sur
vey a web based panel survey of U S healthcare providers commis
sioned by Porter Novelli Public Services http styles porternovelli co
m and administered September by SERMO
http www sermo com The survey which contained questions
assessed healthcare provider attitudes and practices on a broad range of
health topics including family planning service provision just before
and during the COVID pandemic
Study sample
Respondents were sampled from SERMO s Global Medical Panel of
medical professionals Quotas were predetermined to reach pri
mary care physicians obstetrician gynecologists pediatricians
and nurse practitioners or physician assistants Invitations to
participate were sent via email Participation was voluntary
Preventive Medicine
Respondents were paid an honorarium of for completing the
survey depending on the number of questions they were asked The
family planning service provision questions were fielded with primary
care physicians obstetrician gynecologists and pediatricians The
overall response rate was by physician specialty response rates
were for primary care physicians for obstetrician
gynecologists and for pediatricians
Measures
Nine questions were added to the Fall DocStyIes survey to
examine family planning service delivery during the pandemic Physi
cians were asked how many female patients of reproductive age
years for whom their practice provided family planning services per
week just before the COVID pandemic Those providing family
planning services were asked about practice level clinical services pro
vided and strategies used assessed separately at two different time
points just before and at any point during the COVID pandemic
Clinical practices assessed included LARC placement LARC removal
telehealth for contraception initiation and telehealth for contraception
continuation Clinical strategies assessed included accepted self report
of blood pressure during telehealth visits for contraception renewed
contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit allowed
curbside pickup or mail delivery of contraception supported self
administration of subcutaneous injectable contraception counseled on
extending use of LARC beyond their FDA approved duration provided
or prescribed ECPs in advance provided or prescribed a year s worth of
oral contraceptives and sent patient reminders about DMPA depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate injections or LARC removal or replace
ment Additionally physicians were asked about specific practice level
issues experienced related to providing family planning or sexually
transmitted infection STI services because of the COVID pandemic
