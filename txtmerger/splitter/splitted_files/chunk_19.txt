signs
In this study of pregnant women had a good
pregnancy risk perception Studies conducted at health and
medical enters of Hamadan City in the west of Iran
tertiary care hospitals in Winnipeg Manitoba two major
teaching hospitals of a city in Western Canada and urban
tertiary care hospital in western Canada showed that their
mean score perception of pregnancy risk was below the
midpoint of scales It means that of their study par
ticipants perceived that their susceptibility to pregnancy
related complications was mild This difference might be
due to that all the research was conducted using a visual
analog scale tool measurement which is only administered
for literate people data collection tool difference sociocul
tural difference sample size difference and time gap of the
study
This study showed that and of
study subjects perceived that they were susceptible to
pregnancy related complications This finding was higher
than those studies conducted in Mandera County Kenya
This difference might be due to sociocultural differ
ences of study participants study population and time gap
of the study
This research showed that and of
pregnant women were perceived them to be susceptible to
bad pregnancy outcomes and and
were perceived that they are susceptible to difficult preg
nancy periods This finding was consistent with the study
conducted in Mandera County Kenya
In this study and of pregnant
women perceived that their baby will be born prema
turely This result was consistent with studies conducted
in Mandera County Kenya But studies con
ducted at Hamadan City Iran and Winnipeg Manitoba
showed that mean score perceptions were below the
midpoint of scales that indicate mild risk perception
This difference might be due to the difference of mea
surement scale sociocultural difference and time gap of
the study
This study revealed that and of
pregnant women were perceived that the occurrence of preg
nancy complications would not threaten their relationship
with their partners which is lower than a study conducted
in Mandera County Kenya This difference might
be due to the sociocultural difference of study participants
and the time gap of the study Besides it may be because
Ethiopian women were honest with their husbands to keep
their promise during the marriage

In this study mean score perception pregnancy risk in
pregnant women showed that they did not perceive that they
are at risk for dying due to pregnancy related complications
Studies conducted in Winnipeg Manitoba Western Canada
and the west of Iran had mild risk perception This difference
may be due to differences in measurement scale data collec
tion tool sociocultural difference and educational status of
respondents
Approximately seventy percent of women perceived that
their babies would die during labor and delivery This result
was inconsistent with studies conducted in western Canada
and Hamadan City in the west of Iran This difference may
be due to differences in measurement scale sociocultural
difference and educational status of respondents
Pregnant women who had awareness of pregnancy
danger signs were more likely to have positive pregnancy
risk perception than their counterparts This may be due to
knowledge about pregnancy danger signs clearing rumors
about pregnancy related complications and increasing their
awareness about pregnancy related complications
According to this study pregnant women with bad obstet
ric history were more likely to have positive pregnancy risk
perception This may be due to pregnant women being famil
iarized with the bad obstetric outcome and learning their
susceptibility towards pregnancy related complications
In this research one of the factors that affecting posi
tively pregnancy risk perception was knowing a woman
who died due to pregnancy related complications This
may be because these women learned the probability of
developing pregnancy related complications as well as the
consequences of pregnancy related complications from
women s death due to pregnancy related complications
Generally pregnant women with a bad obstetric his
tory past obstetric complication and knew a woman
who died due to pregnancy related complications were
associated with pregnancy risk perception This result
was similar to the concept of availability of the Heuristic
approach which means that an individual makes a judg
ment about likelihood of an event based on experience
or information from others In this study experience
and information from others are pregnant women with
bad obstetric history and past obstetric complications
and knew a woman who died due to pregnancy related
complications respectively
In this study age of pregnant women is not significantly
associated with pregnancy risk perception But women
aged years had statistically significantly associated
with pregnancy risk perception than women aged to
in studies conducted at health and medical centers of
Hamadan City in the west of Iran This difference might
be due to sampling size difference pregnant women
versus pregnant women age category difference
years versus years study participant difference both
nulliparous and multiparous versus only nulliparous mea
surement scale differences Likert scale versus visual analog
scale and the difference in data collection tools
Conclusion
The pregnant women perceive that they were risky in
developing pregnancy related complications and their
consequences were low Only forty eight percent of preg
nant women had good pregnancy risk perception This is
likely to have implications for medical care and pregnancy
outcomes
History of obstetric complication and bad obstetric his
tory was associated with a higher degree of actual risk per
ception in pregnancy whilst women who knew the death of
pregnant women due to pregnancy complication and knew
at least one pregnancy danger signs were more likely to be
concerned about risk
Strength The strength of this research is that it is the
primary research conducted in Ethiopia and Africa Besides
the research measures the outcome variables using the two
components of the health belief model perceived suscepti
bility and severity
Limitations This study was conducted within the
clinical area Therefore the results cannot be generalized to
a woman who failed to attend antenatal care In addition
cultural influence of pregnancy risk perception should be
identify using a qualitative research approach but this
research lacks it

Calculate Feeding Requirements
The objective of Calculate Feeding Requirements inference
is to determine the main feeding requirements for a specific
child according to the determined age stage driven in the
previous inference step with the support of a number of
specifications such as gender and activity status The main
feeding requirements are defined by driven the required
amount of calories These determined requirements are then
taken into consideration in producing the meals schedule for
the child Calculate Feeding Requirements inference derives
its goal by applying the Calculate Needed Calories table that
is defined in the Feeding Requirements Model

CASE STUDY
A web application has been developed for the proposed
system The knowledge base of the proposed children
nutrition expert system is implemented using the Mini
Knowledge Share and Reuse tool MiniKSR while the
control of the system and the user interface were
implemented by Visual Basic Net Microsoft Visual Studio
We have applied two case studies on the developed
system to determine the system accuracy in generating the
suitable meal We changed the values of the required
parameters for example in the health status parameter one
experiment was applied for a healthy child while the second
was applied for a diabetic child We then measured the
accuracy of the system by reviewing the output with experts
in the nutrition field who approved the generated nutrition
schedule
In this section we will present the steps applied in the
developed system showing the steps of these experiments
with demonstrating the developed user interface in the
presented figures
In fig the user enters the required information for the
child they are the birth day gender and activity level and
the health status if exists such as diabetic
In the first case the child is a male was born in
and his activity level is moderately with no health status that
should be considered According to this inputs Calculate
Child Growth Stage subtask will call Calculate Age Stage
inference step to drive the child growth stage which is
determined to be preschool Then Calculate Child Feeding
Requirements subtask will use the output of the previous
inference step to call Calculate Feeding Requirements
inference step which drives the needed calories based on the
child age stage gender and activity level The minimum need
calories is determined by the system to be and the
maximum is Now the Determine Child Meals Schedule
subtask is ready to generate the suitable meal schedule
The system determines the generated needed food unit from
each food category for the presented case Then it determines

considers all age stages of the child with the target of
providing a suitable daily diet This daily diet is given
according to determined criteria such as gender age health
status A case study is presented to prove the accuracy and
applicability of the system However validating the
knowledge for the proposed system and completing the
knowledge base are two of the main future directions Since
the proposed prototype is a first step towards a complete
expert system for a broader target which is providing a whole
nutrition plan for children with explanation facilities and
different varieties of food based on their preferences We also
aim to include more than one plan for the child status to
provide more varieties considering different situations such as
the family financial level Moreover we aim to provide
bilingual interface English and Arabic for more population
to the presented system to serve different levels of families
including education level and financial level
Finally the system determines the meals schedule and
present it to the user as shown in Fig

Gestational diabetes mellitus and antenatal
BACKGROUND
depression are common comorbidities However the combined effects of
antenatal depression and diabetes mellitus during pregnancy on fetal
cell function are unknown
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to test whether the association of
maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and glucose metabolism with cord
blood C peptide levels varies with antenatal depression
STUDY DESIGN Data on motheFchild pairs N from the
Maternal and Infant Health Study in Hefei were analyzed
Gestational diabetes mellitus was diagnosed using the g oral glucose
tolerance test at to weeks of gestation Antenatal depression was
measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during
midpregnancy and late pregnancy Cord blood samples were collected at
delivery and tested for C peptide levels
RESULTS A total of mothers were diagnosed with ges
tational diabetes mellitus Gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with
a confidence internl percentile higher cord blood
C peptide level This association varied with depression severity the differen
ces in cord blood C peptide percentile for gestational diabetes mellitus vs no
gestational diabetes mellitus were confidence interual
for nonantenatal depression confidence interual
for moderate antenatal depression and confi
dence interual for severe antenatal depression in midpreg
nancy Similar associations stratified by antenatal depression in late
pregnancy were observed Antenatal depression was significantly positively

mellitus
GDM defined as diabetes melli
tus diagnosed in the second or third tri
mester of pregnancy that has not been
overt diabetes mellitus before gestation
is widespread and affects to
of women worldwide Maternal hyper
glycemia stimulates the production of
fetal insulin and is associated with fetal
hyperinsulinism Epidemiologic studies
have shown that depression is a com
mon comorbidity in patients with diabe
tes mellitus However the specific role
of antenatal depression AD in the rela
tionship between GDM and fetal hyper
insulinism has seldom been assessed
C peptide concentration is a more sta
ble indicator of insulin synthesis than

circulating insulin levels C peptide is
released from the pancreatic cells and
secreted in equimolar levels with insu
lin Therefore cord blood C peptide
level can be used as an indicator of fetal
hyperinsulinism The gestation period is
considered a crucial time for cell
development and its structure and func
tion may be altered by an adverse
intrauterine environment In pregnant
women with GDM hyperglycemia is
transported to the fetus through the pla
centa causing fetal hyperglycemia which
stimulates the proliferation of fetal islet
cells and increases insulin secretion
thereby promoting fetal growth and fat
accretion The impairment of placental
function by placental inflammation
which is caused by GDM may directly
induce fetal injury or insult to the islet
structures
Depression is a prevalent central ner
vous system condition that affects many
people with diabetes mellitus
In a
meta analysis of studies AD was
linked to risks of GDM with a fold
higher incidence than in controls AD
results in enhanced hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal HPA axis activation
and affects the epigenetic status and
genetic expression in the placenta
which may compromise placental bar
rier function and influence fetal devel
opment However to the best of our
knowledge no study has examined
whether the association between GDM
and fetal hyperinsulinism varies with
AD
Given these previously reported
associations we hypothesized that the
relationship between maternal GDM and
cord blood C peptide levels would vary
with AD To test our hypothesis we
conducted this multicenter prospective
large sample cohort study to examine
the relationship among maternal GDM
cord blood C peptide level and AD
Materials and Methods
Participants
Our study used data from the Maternal
and Infant Health Cohort Study con
ducted in Hefei From March to
April pregnant participants
at to weeks of gestation were
recruited from hospitals in Hefei

Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to test whether the association of maternal gestational diabetes
mellitus GDM and glucose metabolism with cord blood C peptide levels varies
with antenatal depression AD
Key findings
GDM was associated with higher cord blood C peptide levels and varied by
depression severity in both midpregnancy and late pregnancy In addition AD
was significantly positively correlated with fetal hyperinsulinism in participants
with GDM but not in participants without GDM
What does this add to what is known
AD which is related to maternal hyperglycemia can aggravate the risk of fetal
hyperinsulinism in early life Thus psychological factors during pregnancy may
be potentially important targets in the early stages of life for interventions to pre
vent glucose metabolism disorders in childhood

During recruitment we collected socio
demographic information from eligible
pregnant participants via face to face
interviews using a structured question

the participants underwent a g oral
glucose tolerance test OGTT includ
ing fasting plasma glucose FPG
I hour plasma glucose PG and
hour PG According to the criteria
pregnant participants with GDM had
an FPG of mmol L a I hour PG
of mmol L and or a hour PG
of mmol L Nursing care is pro
vided by the attending obstetrician
Based on the results of the OGTT fur
ther recommendations are made for
dietary and lifestyle changes along with
self monitoring of blood glucose
SMBG by performing fasting pre
meal and postmeal blood glucose mon
itoring on to days per week Further
advice on diet and lifestyle modification
and initiation of insulin and or metfor
min was individualized based on SMBG
results If after undergoing dietary and
exercise therapy for to days the
patients fasting or premeal blood glu
cose level is mmol L the patients
hour postprandial blood glucose level
is mmol L or the patients develop
hunger ketosis after adjusting their diet
and the patients blood glucose level
exceeds the pregnancy standard again
after increasing calorie intake insulin
treatment should be promptly initiated
We did not include participants who
were taking any type of medication for
diabetes mellitus or required insulin
treatment during pregnancy
Fasting maternal venous blood sam
ples drawn from participants during
midpregnancy weeks of gesta
tion were used to evaluate maternal
insulin resistance information using the
homeostasis model assessment for insu
lin resistance HOMA IR index The
HOMA IR was calculated as follows
glucose x insulin Cord blood
was drawn from the participants during
delivery and used to evaluate the C pep
tide level and fetal cell function The
samples were processed in the same labo
ratory and stored in the freezer
until use The samples were processed in
the same laboratory and stored in the
freezer until analyzed
The participants were asked to report
their food intake in a face to face inter
view during late pregnancy using a food
frequency questionnaire FFQ which
was used to measure habitual dietary
intake in the preceding months FFQ
development and validation were previ
ously documented
The energy
intake from carbohydrates was calcu
lated as the consumption frequency
multiplied by the carbohydrate content
of each food item Information on
maternal glucose levels and birth out
comes sex gestational age weight
small for gestational age SGA and
large for gestational age LGA was
collected from the patients medical
records SGA was defined as a birth
weight of percentile for gesta
tional age whereas LGA was defined as
a birthweight of percentile for
gestational age
Ascertainment of antenatal
depression
Maternal antenatal depressive symptoms
were measured using the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale EPDS at
midpregnancy weeks of gesta
tion and late pregnancy weeks
of gestation to establish the natural
course of the AD We used the Chinese
version of the EPDS which has been
translated into more than languages
The EPDS is a self reported depression
questionnaire composed of questions
that have been validated for use in the
perinatal period Having clinically signifi
cant symptoms of depression was
defined as an EPDS score of
We defined levels of AD O to points
non AD to points moderate
depression and points severe
depression These threshold levels are
consistent with previous research and
have been shown to have high specificity
and a positive predictive value for
depression for points and
respectively for points
