of a negative relationship between arsenic exposure and birth weight
Bloom et al Rahman et al one meta analysis reports a
significant reduction in birth weight in relation to arsenic exposure
based on four studies Quansah et al the fourth concludes that
evidence of such an association is convincing specifically for higher
levels of arsenic exposure ppb
While other

and ponderal index have been studied Bermudez et al Bloom
et al Chou et al Gilbert Diamond et al Henn
et al Laine et al Liao et al
evidence for an effect
of arsenic exposure on birth length head circumference and ponderal
index is inconclusive Similarly arsenic exposure may exert a role in the
development of pregnancy complications e g gestational diabetes and
preeclampsia Farzan et al Marie et al Peng et al
which in turn may increase later life risks of adverse health
outcomes such as type diabetes and cardiometabolic disease Baz
et al Bellamy et al Chen et al Murphy and Smith
However epidemiologic research evaluating these associations
is limited
Most previous epidemiologic studies on arsenic exposure and ma
ternal and child health were performed in populations with higher le
vels of arsenic exposure such as those found in Bangladesh and Mexico
Laine et al A Rahman et al Few studies have evaluated
these relationships in regions e g United States and Canada with
lower levels of water arsenic Ettinger et al Gilbert Diamond
et al Although the public health implications are large it re
mains unclear whether results based on populations receiving high
level arsenic exposures are relevant to populations receiving low or
moderate level arsenic exposures
Here we sought to understand the impacts of arsenic exposure
during pregnancy on fetal growth and risk of pregnancy complications
in a population of pregnant women with levels of exposure that are
typical in the United States using data from a cohort of mother infant
pairs who participated in the National Children s Study NCS
Methods
Study population
Participants included for analysis are women and children enrolled
in the Initial Vanguard Study of the NCS Information regarding re
cruitment of women is detailed elsewhere
Stanford et al The
Initial Vanguard Study was conducted in seven primary sampling units
i e Queens County New York Montgomery County Pennsylvania
Waukesha County Wisconsin Brookings County South Dakota and
Yellow Medicine Pipestone and Lincoln counties Minnesota Orange
County California Salt Lake County Utah Duplin County North
Carolina using a geographically based probability sample design from
January September According to estimates from the United
States Geological Survey the groundwater in each of these counties is
estimated to contain less than the US Environmental Protection Agency
EPA limit of gg L of arsenic
Ayotte et al EPA
In order to be included in the study the following eligibility criteria
needed to be met household screening performed during or before the
woman s pregnancy current pregnancy or high probability of preg
nancy and ability to grant informed consent mother infant pairs
met these criteria and were enrolled in the study Enrolled women
completed up to two pregnancy visits that consisted of extensive in
terview self administered questionnaires a physical examination and
biospecimen blood and urine and environmental sample collections
Since the purpose of the Initial Vanguard Study was to test study
procedures and feasibilities many changes were made over the course
of the year study period Specifically changes to the data collection
protocols led to only a subset of mother infant pairs with all study
variables collected Of the mother infant pairs pairs without
Y H etaL
missing data were included to evaluate the association between birth
outcome and DMA and pairs without missing data were included
in relation to total arsenic For adverse health outcomes during preg
nancy and women without missing data were included to
investigate the association with DMA and total arsenic respectively

Assessment of prenatal arsenic exposure
A spot urine sample was collected during the third trimester from a
subset of participants Urine was collected into a pre screened metal
free container and was frozen locally until shipment on dry ice to the
NCS Repository Fisher Bioservices Rockville MD Urine was ali
quoted into pre screened metal free cryovials and stored at oc
until shipment on dry ice to the US Centers for Disease Control s
National Center for Environmental Health Since the initial purpose of
laboratory testing of the Initial Vanguard Study was operational quality
control assessment urine samples were selected for measuring total
arsenic and arsenic species based on availability across study sites
without any additional criteria Further experiments for total arsenic
and arsenic species were administered at different time points resulting
in different sample sizes available for the analyses in the current study
Urinary total arsenic concentration was measured by inductively cou
pled plasma dynamic reaction cell mass spectrometry ICP DRC MS
with a limit of detection LOD of gg L Concentrations of urinary
arsenic species were measured using high performance liquid chroma
tography HPLC coupled to ICP DRC MS The LODs were as follows
arsenic acid gg L arsenobetaine gg L arsenocholine gg
L arsenous acid gg L DMA gg L MMA gg L and
trimethylarsine oxide gg L For analytical results below the LOD an
imputed value equivalent to the LOD divided by the square root of two
was assigned Here total arsenic gg L and DMA
gg L were analyzed as main exposure variables since a
significant percentage of samples had concentrations of other
metabolites i e arsenic acid arsenobetaine arsenocholine arsenous
acid MMA and trimethylarsine oxide below the LOD
Assessment of outcomes
The NCS protocol included physical examination of children at
birth Birth length cm and head circumference cm were measured
twice and the average of the two readings was used For offspring
without measures of length n and head circumference n
values were abstracted from medical records using Community Health
Information Architecture CHITA instruments Birth weight was not
measured during the physical exam and was therefore extracted from
medical records Ponderal index an indicator of infant adiposity is a
measure of in utero growth retardation
Vintzileos et al Yagel
Thus we derived ponderal index by dividing birth weight
et al
in kilograms by cubed birth length in meters kg Gestational age
was also collected from medical records and preterm birth was defined
less than completed weeks of gestational
Information regarding complications during pregnancy was ab
stracted from medical records at the final birth visit Three dichotomous
yes no outcome variables were included in our analyses any com
plication gestational diabetes and preeclampsia Any complication
was defined as conditions including gestational diabetes preeclampsia
placenta previa preterm birth and significant vaginal bleeding ex
cluding previa
Assessment of covariates
Maternal characteristics including age race ethnicity education
level family income and number of previous live births were obtained
from the first pregnancy interview Self reported weight and height

index BMI was calculated as weight kg height m Infant sex was
ascertained from medical records Concentrations of creatinine were
measured in spot urine samples collected during the third trimester
from all women using the Roche Hitachi Modular P Chemistry Analyzer

Statistical analysis

thus multivariable regression models with cross product terms be

Discussion
We assessed the impact of prenatal arsenic exposure measured from
maternal urine at the third trimester on the risk of complications during
pregnancy as well as birth outcomes using a sample of mother infant
pairs from the US based NCS Prenatal exposure to total arsenic as well
as DMA was positively associated with birth length and head cir
cumference and negatively associated with ponderal index Our results
from analyses evaluating effect modification by infant sex further found
a negative association between concentration of DMA and gestational
age only among female infants Maternal urinary arsenic at the third
trimester was not significantly associated with birth weight or com
plications during pregnancy Given the rigorous study design good
exposure metric i e urinary arsenic biomarker and critical exposure
time window selected this study adds valuable information to current
evidence on the impact of low level prenatal arsenic exposure on birth
outcomes
A positive relationship between arsenic exposure and birth length
was previously observed in a large prospective cohort study conducted
in New Hampshire of mother infant pairs with similar levels of
arsenic exposure Gilbert Diamond et al That study reported a
cm and cm increase in birth length in relation to each unit
increase in log transformed prenatal DMA and total arsenic con
centrations respectively measured from maternal urine at the second
trimester Further the study demonstrated that a positive association
between arsenic exposure and birth length was primarily driven by
male infants Six other prospective studies evaluated this relationship

no significant association was found in five of the studies conducted in
Bangladesh Romania Mexico and Taiwan Bloom et al Chou
et al Laine et al Liao et al A Rahman et al
while a study in a Chinese population reported a negative as
sociation between urinary arsenic exposure and birth length Liu et al
The potential for arsenic to enhance birth length and subse
quently ponderal index may be attributable to effects on bone devel
opment An in vitro study suggested that arsenic trioxide an oxide of
arsenic exerts different effects on osteoblast growth based on the given
dosage
Xu et al while high dose of arsenic trioxide and
gM induced apoptosis of osteoblasts results demonstrated a sig
nificantly enhanced viability of cultured osteoblasts as well as increased
collagen synthesis following exposure to a low dose and
gM of arsenic trioxide Therefore the unexpected findings con
necting higher but still moderate arsenic exposure to longer birth
length may be related to this or a similar phenomenon
Our results linking higher arsenic exposure with greater head cir
cumference at birth are in contrast to existing evidence suggesting a
negative association Gilbert Diamond et al Henn et al
Liao et al A Rahman et al Specifically three pro
spective cohort studies conducted in Bangladesh and the US observed
significant associations of maternal urinary total arsenic and blood ar
senic levels with smaller head circumference Gilbert Diamond et al
Henn et al A Rahman et al
However multiple
other studies have reported null associations Bermudez et al
Bloom et al Chou et al Laine et al
Given the
inconsistencies with previous research and no apparent biological me
chanism the observed positive association between arsenic exposure
and head circumference in the current analysis might be spurious
Taken together these conflicting findings suggest that further research
is needed with a larger sample size and comprehensive measurement of
potential confounders
Our observed association with ponderal index represents only the
third study to examine this measure of possible intrauterine growth
restriction The previous research has been mixed with one study also
reporting that lower ponderal index is associated with maternal urinary
arsenic levels Gilbert Diamond et al and the other finding null
results overall but a significant positive association among female in
fants Bloom et al Future research investigating the effect of
arsenic on ponderal index and the potential interaction effect with sex
is still needed
Gestational age has been assessed as an outcome in multiple pre
vious studies of arsenic exposure Generally these past studies reported
a significant relationship between decreased gestational age and arsenic
exposure measured in drinking water maternal urine and maternal
blood
Henn et al Laine et al Xu et al
Specifi
cally a study conducted in China observed a negative association in
male but not female infants
Xu et al
In contrast we observed a
negative association between arsenic exposure and gestational age only
in female infants Differences in the exposure concentrations dietary or
behavioral practices or ancestry of the study samples may account for
the differences observed between these studies Although the evidence
connecting arsenic exposure to decreased gestational age is compelling
further confirmation by additional studies is needed to evaluate whe
ther effect modification of this association by infant sex is more widely
seen
While gestational age and birth weight are biologically related we
observed no significant association between prenatal arsenic exposure
and birth weight in the current study A systematic review published in
indicated that there is a convincing evidence on the association
between higher levels of arsenic exposure ppb and decreased
birth weight Further in a recent meta analysis using data from
studies prenatal arsenic exposure was significantly associated with
decreased birth weight and this observed negative association persisted
after restricting to studies in populations with lower levels of arsenic
exposure three US and one Chile
Zhong et al
However in a
Environmental Research
US prospective cohort study that is not included in the aforementioned
meta analysis no significant association was observed in relation to
birth weight Gilbert Diamond et al Although it is possible that
we had insufficient statistical power with the given sample to observe
an association between low level arsenic exposure and birth weight
further research in populations with lower levels of arsenic exposure is
still needed to evaluate this association
Previous literature on the association between arsenic exposure and
pregnancy complications is relatively limited and reports mixed find
ings possibly due to the heterogeneity of study designs and exposure
metrics used across studies While several studies have reported sig
nificant associations between arsenic exposure and preterm birth
Ahmad et al Almberg et al Huang et al Rahman
et al
others have observed no association
Kim et al
Myers et al No significant association with gestational diabetes
has been observed for drinking water arsenic and prenatal urinary ar
senic concentrations Bloom et al Gilbert Diamond et al
Yet studies that relied on maternal blood Ettinger et al Shapiro
et al maternal serum Xia et al maternal toenail
Farzan et al and drinking water Farzan et al Marie
et al
samples have shown significant associations of arsenic
exposure with increased risk of gestational diabetes or impaired glucose
tolerance no association was found in relation to maternal urinary
arsenic Farzan et al Two case control studies evaluated the
relationship between arsenic exposure and risk of preeclampsia re
porting no significant association Elongi Moyene et al
Sandoval Carrillo et al Our findings which used internal bio
markers of exposure are consistent with these previous findings sug
gesting no association between urinary arsenic and pregnancy compli
cations of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia Still the mixed
evidence underscores a need for further prospective studies assessing a
larger number of events
In this study two exposure variables i e total arsenic and DMA
were used to represent levels of arsenic exposure Total arsenic is a
mixture of organic and inorganic arsenic while DMA is one of the or
ganic metabolites after the methylation of inorganic arsenic Although
absolute value of DMA was used for the current analyses DMA con
centration may still imply two circumstances higher arsenic me
tabolism efficiency or higher inorganic arsenic exposure This may
explain the different findings in relation to total arsenic and DMA in our
sex stratified analyses In a study reporting results for the associations
of both total arsenic and DMA with birth outcomes findings were si
milar between total arsenic and DMA Gilbert Diamond et al
They also supported our findings of positive associations between DMA
and birth length as well as negative associations in relation to ponderal
index Further no significant association was found in relation to ar
senic methylation efficiency indices i e MMA inorganic arsenic and
DMA MMA with birth outcomes in the aforementioned study
The conclusions of this study could be strengthened by future re
search First the exposure assessment while an accurate biomarker of
arsenic exposure captures exposure during the third trimester only The
third trimester urine sample may reflect exposure after the time that is
most critical for developing pregnancy complications and potential
misclassification of prenatal arsenic exposure may exist due to the re
latively short half life of arsenic in urine Furthermore the laboratory
method used for measuring arsenobetaine in this study had a higher
LOD gg L as compared to some previous studies Gilbert Diamond
et al Laine et al
and of samples n had
arsenobetaine concentrations below the LOD Therefore the estimated
non seafood arsenic exposures used in the sensitivity analyses may not
be accurate We further compared the percentage below the LOD and
level of arsenobetaine between women in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey NHANES cycles and the
Supplemental Table Within the NHANES sample pregnant

women had lower mean arsenobetaine concentrations compared to

Abstract
We estimate that prenatal care has positive impacts on health measured at
birth shifts the distribution of future health care utilization away from
inpatient care and find that some of these impacts likely come from an
informational mechanism We also find well child visits are used in a com
plementary fashion with emergency department care in the production of
infant health suggesting that factors beyond barriers to access may drive the
demand for emergency care Finally we find differential impacts of prenatal
care across racial groups with evidence that the information mechanism may
be particularly important for black mothers

BACKGROUND
Poor health at birth generates substantial medical costs and is associated with subsequent health problems that extend
well into the future For instance infants born at low birth weight are statistically more likely to have lower educational
attainment lower wages and worse employment prospects compared to normal weight peers Almond et al
Behrman Rosenzweig Black et al Given the importance of early health it is important to understand
the underlying mechanisms and factors that impact birth outcomes Prenatal care as perhaps the earliest medical input
into child health deserves special attention Medical professionals emphasize the importance of prenatal care to both
monitor maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and to minimize potential risk factors Despite the common
perception that increased prenatal care should lead to more favorable health outcomes the current economic literature
provides confounding evidence as to the marginal impacts of prenatal care on infant health at birth and scant evidence
of any kind regarding the direct long run impacts of prenatal care on future well being
One major difficulty in identifying the causal effects of prenatal care arises from the decision to seek prenatal care itself
Unobservable maternal health characteristics and attitudes may simultaneously influence choices to seek prenatal care
and also have a direct effect on infant health making it difficult to isolate causal relationships While a majority of early

studies relied on ordinary least squares multivariate regressions more recent work has made efforts to account for the
potential endogeneity of prenatal care Evans and Lien exploit a disruption in public transportation due to a bus
strike in Pennsylvania as an instrument for prenatal care Despite statistically imprecise estimates they find that prenatal
visits missed in early pregnancy negatively impact birth weight while those missed later in pregnancy do not have affect
birth weight Currie and Grogger use expansions of the Medicaid program as an instrument and find prenatal care
reduces the incidence of very low birth weight among white mothers Sonchak uses Medicaid reimbursement rates
as an instrument and estimates that additional visits increase birth weight among white mothers but have no effect for
black mothers Broadly this strand of literature can be grouped into studies finding positive effects of prenatal care
Conway Deb Liu Liu et al Rosenzweig Schultz Yan those finding no effects
Jones Li Poirier and those finding only weak effects Currie Grogger Evans Lien Corman
et al also provide an excellent and more extensive review of the existing literature
To our knowledge and due to the difficulty of linking mothers across births only a few studies have utilized panel
data and maternal fixed effects to estimate the impacts of prenatal care Abrevaya and Dahl use data from
Washington and Arizona between and to study the effect of different inputs including smoking and prenatal
care on child health using quantile estimation Their results indicate a larger positive effect of prenatal care at the
bottom of the birth weight distribution Royer focuses on the effect of maternal age on prematurity and incidence
of low birth weight by using a panel of mothers from Texas More recently Balsa and Triunfo examine the
impact of prenatal care on infant birth weight among low income women in Uruguay and find prenatal care decreases
the likelihood of low birth weight and preterm birth Yan examines whether prenatal care has an effect on

labor breastfeeding and other outcomes and finds that early onset of prenatal care confers positive effects on maternal
health and behaviors Yan uses data from Pennsylvania and a similar study design to ours and finds that early
onset of prenatal care broadly improves an infant s stock of health capital None of these studies however utilize any
child health outcomes beyond those observable at the time of birth
In contrast to its impacts on infant health at birth there is very limited literature on any intermediate or longer run
impacts of prenatal care directly Freed et al and Kogan et al both find a positive association between
adequate and early initiation of prenatal care respectively on subsequent well child visits WCVs though neither study
accounts for the potential endogeneity of the decision to seek care In the economics literature Reichman et al
offer a theoretical framework that is quite similar to ours and estimate that prenatal care is associated with positive
changes in maternal postpartum behaviors and subsequent well child health care while Noonan et al investigate
the effects of prenatal care and find no impacts on four outcomes for children at age health status height weight and
asthma diagnosis Both studies use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study Despite accounting for a
rich set of covariates as well as controlling for state city and hospital indicators and performing a variety of robustness
checks these studies do not explicitly account for the potential endogeneity of prenatal care
Our study uses unique maternally linked birth data from Vital Statistics Natality files for the state of South Carolina
from to to reexamine the effect of prenatal care on the health of newborns We extend on the prior literature
by estimating the longer term effects of prenatal care on future health care utilization patterns identified from linked
South Carolina Medicaid claims files We estimate plausibly causal impacts of prenatal care by including maternal fixed
effects which control for all time invariant unobserved characteristics of the mother Understanding the causal effect of
prenatal care on child health and health care utilization is of paramount importance and the results we obtain are
likely to have important policy implications regarding the long term cost effectiveness of prenatal care
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Outline of theoretical model
The theoretical framework underlying our study mirrors the health production function in a dynamic setting outlined
by Liu et al In their framework it is assumed parents maximize a time separable concave utility function with
per period utility given by U ct ht where ct represents consumption during period t and ht represents child health at
the start of the period Health cannot be altered within a time period nor can it be directly purchased but parents can
impact the future health of their children through health inputs ft Again following the notation in Liu Mroz and
Adair we assume health status in the next period is given by

with the deterministic health production function and st l a health shock distributed with mean of In this
framework the information set Qt captures parental information about the future distributions of prices income and
health shocks as of time t and the expected health stock in time period t is equal to Additionally assume
that the following all hold

Liu Mroz and Adair show that the solution to the dynamic optimization problem where parents maximize the
present discounted value of expected utility subject to a resource constraint given by yt ct p t with yt representing
parental resources pt representing the price of health inputs and the price of consumption normalized to implies the
demand for health inputs at time t is a function of the form
ft Dft yt ht pt ot
Equation shows that the demand for health inputs only depends on the state variables observed at time t They go
on to explain that under certain conditions including the assumption that the distributions of health shocks st are
independent over time it is not necessary to further condition the demand for inputs based on the information set
However some features of preventive care may compress or eliminate some outcomes from the distribution of
shocks in which case it is not appropriate to assume this distribution is independent over time Although some of these
impacts are captured by improved health on average preventive care may also change the variance of outcomes
Schoder and Zweifel posit that this feature may be an important determinant of health care demand in some
cases For example if st is distributed uniformly on the interval parents are willing to pay for preventive care that
changes the distribution of st to be distributed uniformly on the interval In this case the information set must
contain beliefs about how health inputs change the entire distribution of future health care shocks I and not just beliefs
about the marginal productivity of care
In our setting it is likely that most direct effects of prenatal care on health are primarily through reducing the
variance of outcomes by monitoring for severe complications Additionally a fraction of the estimated impacts of
prenatal care seem likely to arise from indirect effects whereby prenatal care influences the maternal information
making mothers more likely to cease smoking eat nutritious food or otherwise modify behaviors that directly influence
infant birth weight In one of the few studies that we are aware of which separately estimates the impacts of the content
of prenatal care Kogan et al find that women who do not receive all types of recommended advice during their
prenatal care visits are significantly more likely to have an infant born at low birthweight than those that receive the
advice and also find no association between any clinical aspects of prenatal care and low birthweight Additionally
Yan provides evidence that maternal weight gain and smoking during pregnancy behaviors that are influenced
by the provision of information during prenatal care appointments are two distinct mechanisms through which
prenatal care influences infant health while Yan also shows that these behaviors are influenced by prenatal care
On the other hand Dave et al do not find evidence that increased contact with providers following Medicaid
expansions leads to modifications in maternal behavior during pregnancy though they do find evidence that access to
insurance causes some behavioral changes through moral hazard Though not related to prenatal care Dave and
Kaestner find evidence that increased contact with physicians can lead to significant behavioral changes in
Medicare eligible individuals In our case the total estimated impacts of prenatal care on future health care utilization
will also be influenced if prenatal care changes parental beliefs about the value of future health care and we refer to this
possibility as the information effect of prenatal care
Implications of theoretical model for interpretations related to future health care
utilization
In an ideal world we would estimate the net effects of prenatal care on future health outcomes In our data however
we only observe future health care utilization meaning our estimated impacts of prenatal care combine changes in

demand for future care arising from better health with changes in demand arising from changes to the maternal in
formation set Given that providing information and education is a large component of most prenatal care it is highly
plausible that prenatal care influences the information set by providing parents with information about postnatal health
behaviors including interacting with the health care delivery system
The estimated impacts of prenatal care on future health care utilization are given by estimating I with ft rep
resenting prenatal care Assuming prenatal care does not influence parental income or prices within the year imme

The first term on the right hand side of Equation is the change in demand caused by any impacts of
prenatal care on health status Our model assumes this term is weakly negative as all else equal those in better
health will consume less care Additionally the broad range of empirical findings outlined previously suggest this
term is in fact non positive The sign of the second term on the right hand side of Equation is theoretically
ambiguous as increased information is likely to increase the demand for some types of health care while reducing
it for others In cases where the net estimated impact of prenatal care on future care utilization is positive
however
must hold and the impact on care utilization arising from this change in information must be
large enough to outweigh reduced utilization from better health Note that this does not imply that individuals who
consume less care are necessarily in better health as the information effect can reduce the demand for certain
types of care Rather it implies that if prenatal care is associated with both better health and increased con
sumption of a given type of future care it must be the case that the information effect increased the demand for
that type of care
In the context of our theoretical model we expect the information effect associated with prenatal care to increase
the demand for preventive types of care such as WCVs and to have little impact on inpatient IP care which is
typically only accessed through a physician gatekeeper The predicted sign of the information effect for care in an
emergency department ED is theoretically ambiguous If preventive care is a substitute for ED usage increased in
formation should decrease the demand for care in an ED In a current NBER working paper Danagoulian et al
document that increased primary care visits following an information shock from the Flint water crisis led to a sig
nificant reduction in subsequent avoidable childhood ED visits If however preventive care and ED care are used as
complements in the production of health and the prevention of disease it is possible that the information effect would
