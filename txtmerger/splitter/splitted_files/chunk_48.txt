f women drop
out earlier than expected
To date relatively few studies have
focused on examining the characteristics of
women who diol of prevention programs
prematurely of these studies have
focused on pregnant women at risk for poor
psychosocial functioning and none are spe
cific to maternal home visitation programs
Given the dearth of information concerning
the characteristics of program dropouts and
completers and the applicability of this
knowledge to program planning the present
study examined associations between
women s sociodemographic characteristics
perceived needs psychological functioning
substance use and informal social support
networks and their duration of participation

Abstract In order to build knowledge and to make informed
decisions regarding childbirth women need to gather information
Online resources can play a relevant role to its access and health
professionals can recommend support and endorse it The aim of
this study is to understand the current state of e health services for
childbirth education provided by the Portuguese I lealth System
The data was collected from five portals a Portuguese National
Patient Portal b Academia project website c Portuguese Health
System website d Digital Library in Health Literacy e
Results show that childbirth topics are scarce or inexistent on
those platforms Only one document was found related to
Pregnancy with four pages regarding Childbirth which were
analysed according to the topics coverage organisation approach
and visual presentation The results show that there is room for
novel initiatives on e health to promote childbirth education in

The emergence of Electronic Health can be associated with
the usage of informatics systems and services in healthcare not
only by health professionals but also by the general public E
Health outline can be established when information and
communication technology is used in order to be a valuable
resource to improve health care and on a broader sense when
users of digital devices access healthcare information as well as
useful services and tools that promote a healthy living by helping
them to manage their own health and wellness l
Pregnant women have been using digital technologies for
information and support with differentiated uses according
to successive digital technology eras They usually search for
information in pregnancy related to websites and blogs and
interacted through discussion forums More recently
with the advent of diverse new digital media as social web and
mobile ubiquitous computing devices they expanded even
more their usage According to Tripp et al by
downloading informative data pregnant women end up reducing
the frequency of visits to the hospital since their anxiety levels
dropped and they could understand their own conditions
It is during the antenatal care appointments that health
professionals have the opportunity to mitigate women s
concerns and anxiety related to the pregnancy process and to
prepare them for the childbirth and postpartum One of the
healthcare professionals responsibilities is to support

expectant parents to better distinguish which resources are
trustworthy containing reliable and up to date information and
which ones should be ignored since it is imperative to separate
facts from fiction by clarifying popular and problematic
discourses around pregnancy labour birth and the unbom
As reinforcement tools there are specific digital materials
that could be used to help clarifying definitions and to
demonstrate the process and explain interventions ranging from
e books digital illustrations photos and videos to sum up to the
conventional printed based approach of handling brochures and
booklets
A study from already highlighted the importance of
websites run by health professionals e g Mayo Clinic
governmental websites and medicine research sources e g
Pub Med The majority of participants in the survey suggested
that the healthcare providers should recommend suitable Internet
sites for the purpose of adding information to the one provided
during the appointments gaining more control over their
decisions related to pregnancy and raising their confidence for
talking to the health professionals about their concerns
This study aims to analyse the current state of e Health
services and digital information provided by the Portuguese
National Health System Sistema Nacional de SNS that
could be pointed out by health professionals to contribute for
childbirth knowledge in particular related to labour and birth
topics This study is part of an ongoing PhD research to deepen
knowledge on the role that digital media could have to support
the informed decision making process by providing
educational resources that clarify the best practices
recommended by the World Health Organization
II METHODS
The first step of this study aimed at exploiting the
organisation of the Portuguese National Health System in order
to support the process of sources selection To avoid leaving

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective Medication abortion MAB is safe and effective up to days gestation Limited data are
available on how often patients are ineligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age and how many of
those ineligible go on to receive procedural abortion
Study design Retrospective analysis of electronic health records from Planned Parenthood of the Pacific
Southwest PPPSW from January December PPPSW has four procedural abortion sites and MAB
only clinics that offered appointments only if last menstrual period based GA was days or unknown
Patients days gestation by intake ultrasound at a MAB only clinic were referred to a procedural center
Results Of patients presenting for MAB at MAB only sites did not receive a MAB
N presented past days gestation and were thus ineligible due to gestational age limits Of those
ineligible N measured between days of gestation Three quarters of those
ineligible went on to receive a procedural abortion at PPPSW after a mean wait time of days In multi
variable analysis no demographic factors were associated with higher odds of receiving a procedural
abortion
Conclusions Presenting for MAB past a gestational age limit was uncommon supporting safety of no test
MAB protocols A quarter of people ineligible for MAB due to gestational age did not receive a procedural
abortion at PPPSW If MAB were offered up to days half of patients who were denied MAB due to
gestational age could have received MAB expanding patient access
Implications Being ineligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age was uncommon Increasing MAB
gestational age limits from days to days could further improve abortion access

Access to abortion services is increasingly under threat Efforts to
improve access have included expansion of medication abortion
MAB services into new practice settings leading to increases in the
number of non hospital facilities that provide MAB II Not all clinics
that provide MAB have the necessary trained providers or facilities
to also offer procedural abortion As of of abortion clinic
facilities in the United States only provided MAB For instance in

MAB were beyond days gestation
However it is unknown
how frequently people present beyond days gestation at MAB
only clinics and whether these patients are able to follow through on
referrals to sites offering procedural services
Assessing outcomes for people who are ineligible for MAB based
on gestational age and must be referred provides important nuance
to our understanding of systemic barriers to abortion care It also
informs discussion of the optimal days gestation up to which med
ication abortion should be offered and the implications of omitting
dating ultrasounds prior to MAB which are particularly relevant
given the recent rise of both no test MAB protocols and self man
aged MAB In a unique cohort of patients who did not receive a MAB
after presenting for one at a MAB only Planned Parenthood filiate
clinic we sought to determine frequency of being ineligible for
medication abortion due to days gestation characterize
frequency and duration of delays in care among patients who did not
receive same day MAB and estimate the number of people who
could have received a MAB if gestational age limits were raised to
days
Materials and methods
Definition of sample
Patients included in the study did not receive a MAB after pre
senting for MAB at a PPPSW clinic that does not offer procedural
abortion services from January through December Fig
The PPPSW system has clinics of which offer only MAB one of
which offers only procedural abortion and three of which offer both
MAB and procedural abortion Patients scheduling a MAB appoint
ment either online or by telephone provide a date of LMP and are
able to schedule a MAB appointment only if their estimated days
gestation at the time of scheduling is under days If they have an
uncertain LMP they are directed to call for an appointment and are
allowed to schedule at a MAB only clinic but receive counseling that
they may need a procedural abortion if they are beyond days
gestation on intake ultrasound If a patient is ineligible for MAB after
intake ultrasound at a MAB only clinic they are referred to and
scheduled at a procedural location for a later date At the time of the
study MAB was only provided to patients presenting at days
gestation or less by ultrasound Affiate policy allowed for the pro
vision of MAB in patients with a pregnancy of unknown location on
ultrasound if the patient was asymptomatic no vaginal bleeding or
abdominal pain and had no other risk factors for ectopic pregnancy
The study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional
Review Board at University of California San Diego
Primary variables of interest
All patients received a clinic administered urine pregnancy test
and transvaginal ultrasound at their MAB appointment unless their
in clinic pregnancy test was negative Ultrasound findings were used
to determine type of pregnancy including Intrauterine pregnancy
ultrasound had a clear intrauterine yolk sac and or fetal pole
Pregnancy of Unknown Location PUL positive pregnancy test
without a definitive intrauterine pregnancy Possible Molar
Pregnancy and Early Pregnancy Loss EPL anembryonic preg
nancy complete abortion retained products of conception in
trauterine fetal demise or incomplete abortion Confirmed ectopic
pregnancies were not included in the sample Gestational age vari
ables included both patient reported last menstrual period as well
as ultrasound measurement of fetal pole or gestational sac Receipt
of a procedural abortion after initial MAB visit was determined by
review of medical records from PPPSW procedural centers In order
to account for incomplete follow up for those who had their initial
MAB visit at the end of the study period analysis of the receipt of
Contraception xxx xxxx xxx
procedural abortion was restricted to patients who had their initial
MAB visit before September Thus this cohort was followed
until at least weeks gestation legal limit of abortion in
California
Demographic variables
Data on race and ethnicity were collapsed into larger categories
for ease of analysis Categories provided in the clinical records in
cluded white African American Black Asian and Hispanic Latinx In
addition an Other category was created which included patients
who identified their race as Filipino multi racial Middle Eastern
Native American Pacific Islander and other Patient age was re
ported in number of years and was analyzed as a continuous vari
able Patient state of residence was collapsed into two categories
In state for those residing in California and out of state for
those from all other states or outside of the United States Type of
payment for the medication abortion visit was reported as Medi Cal
California based Medicaid commercial insurance or self pay
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated comparing those who
presented for MAB prior to versus after days gestation by ultra
sound Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to de
termine which demographic factors were associated with odds of
receiving a procedural abortion among those who presented for a
MAB visit but were ineligible due to being beyond days gestation
by ultrasound Multivariable logistic regression was performed to
estimate adjusted odds ratios Covariates thought likely to influence
whether patients were able to follow up after being denied MAB
were included in the multivariable model age race ethnicity pay
ment type and ultrasound based days gestation at presentation
Alpha was set at for all regression models Analysis was per
formed using Stata statistical software Stata Corp College

Discussion
We explored eligibility for MAB based on gestational age and
found that of all patients presenting for MAB at a MAB only
clinic were past the clinic gestational age limit of days by ultra
sound despite clinic screening that offered appointments only to
patients days gestation by LMP Of patients who were not eli
gible to receive a MAB due to gestational age the majority went on
to receive a procedural abortion and most within two
weeks of their initial MAB appointment
Medication abortion is safe and effective up to days gestation
with some research supporting high effcacy even beyond
days
We found that of all patients presenting at MAB
only sites were between days gestational age Importantly
over half of patients in our study ineligible due to gestational age
limit would have been eligible if MAB were offered up to days
Given this offering MAB up to days could improve clinic oper
ating effciency and patient access to care However these benefits
are more likely to be realized if patients with estimated gestation
between days are not scheduled at MAB only clinics Of note
since this study was completed the study site implemented a prac
tice change to allow MAB provision up to days gestation Patients
with dating by LMP up to days are now able to schedule at MAB
only clinics
A notable proportion of the patients who were in
eligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age did not later re
ceive a procedural abortion at PPPSW Geographic financial
political and logistical barriers can prevent patients from acting on
referrals and accessing follow up care
For instance it is
possible some patients who traveled long distances to Southern
California for a MAB were unable to return at a later time for a
surgical abortion However it is unknown based on available data
what percentage of patients desired a procedural abortion but faced
barriers arranging follow up versus decided they no longer desired
pregnancy termination or sought pregnancy termination at a site
outside PPPSW Further research via patient interviews or surveys
would be useful in answering these questions and seeking solutions
to barriers that prevent patients from obtaining desired care
Increased focus and research on no test medication abortion
protocols that don t require an ultrasound was driven by the
Coronavirus COVID pandemic Our findings including the
overall low incidence of presentation beyond days and relatively
high accuracy of history based dating when compared to ultrasound
are in line with prior research that has shown no test protocols are
safe and effective without a preceding ultrasound to confirm dating
A prior study conducted at another Planned Parenthood filiate
found that medical management of PUL results in sooner diagnosis
of ectopic pregnancy than expectant management
Despite this
we found that a significant number of patients that did not receive a
planned MAB had a pregnancy of unknown location This population
likely contains patients who were symptomatic vaginal bleeding
abdominal pain and thus not eligible for MAB Our data did not
allow for stratification by symptoms and our study was not designed
to determine frequency of MAB provision for patients with PUL but
these findings suggest further research is needed to understand
current trends in the implementation of MAB for PUL
Strengths of our study include the large sample size and inclu
Sion of multiple different clinical sites that were unified under a

consistent clinical protocol However our findings should be con
sidered in light of several limitations We relied on health record
data which did not allow us to determine why patients did not go on
to receive a procedural abortion In addition the generalizability of
our results is limited as the study only included Planned Parenthood
filiate clinics in Southern California and was conducted during the
COVID pandemic Differing screening policies within other clinic
systems are likely to impact the frequency with which patients
present for MAB past gestational age limits
Overall our study demonstrated that within a large family
planning clinic system a significant portion of patients who pre
sented for MAB and did not receive one were ineligible based on a
gestational age limit for MAB care If the gestational age limit for
MAB had been increased to days during the study period the
majority of these patients would have been eligible for MAB at their
initial visit In a system with a robust referral structure most pa
tients ineligible for MAB by gestational age ended up receiving a
procedural abortion with a reasonable wait time but further re
search is needed to understand if this holds true in other areas and
health systems

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Child malnutrition is a significant public health concern in several developing countries Evidence suggests
that family size and children s health outcomes are correlated We utilize data from the National Family
Health Survey NFHS for India and employ an Instrumental Variable approach to examine the impact
of limiting fertility through the use of contraceptives on child health Exploiting the exogenous variation in
district average of women s exposure to family planning messages we estimate that contraception leads to
a SD increase in a child s height for age weight for age z scores and reduces the likelihood of
stunting being underweight by pp We provide support to the resource dilution hypothesis as
our potential mechanism highlighting that an exogenous increase in household size explained by multiple or
twin births depletes children s health Our findings underscore the benefits of exposure to family planning for
child health and the need for targeted policies focusing on access to and use of contraceptives
Child malnutrition is a rising and persistent issue affecting most
of the low and middle income countries across the globe As of
the World Health Organization estimates suggest that mil
lion children under years of age are stunted million are wasted
and million are overweight Aside from having a long lasting phys
iological effect on children undernutrition has also been linked to poor
mental development lower academic performance and behavioral ab
normalities Martins et al Dercon and
Besides
undernutrition has significant economic consequences through loss of
human capital and productivity perpetuating poverty and abating the
development of nations

decades of investments and interventions India continues to be home
to a third of the world s stunted children and one half of all under
mortality is attributable to undernutrition
There is substantial evidence that children from larger families
with more siblings and higher birth orders have poorer health human
capital outcomes and cognitive development

These findings rely largely on the seminal quantity

which emphasizes the scarcity of parental time and physical resources

Dang and Rogers Mogstad and Wiswall Thus one can
plausibly expect that limiting fertility rates may lead to greater atten
tion care and resource allocation towards existing children With this
in mind in this paper we examine the impacts of limiting fertility
through the use of contraceptives on child health for India

in Mumbai which is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare MoHFW Government of India The sample is drawn using
stratified random sampling
We use the individual women s and children s data from NFHS
Individual women s data consists of one record for every eligible
woman in the reproductive age of and years and collects infor
mation about her background characteristics health knowledge health
behaviors fertility patterns child s health and nutritional status as well
as household characteristics We restrict the women s data to include
women married only once to ensure that the woman s responses about
contraceptive use pertain to her current union
The children s data consists of one record for every child of the in
terviewed woman born up to five years preceding the survey It collects
information on both demographic and anthropometric characteristics of
children between the ages of O to months We merge the two data
sets and our unit of analysis is the children born to women in the last
five years Our final sample consists of observations
Measurement of child nutritional status
NFHS contains information on the nutritional status of children
under the age of For our baseline analysis we measure child health
with their anthropometric measures of nutritional surveillance viz
height for age z score HAZ and weight for age z score WAZ These
anthropometric measures are calculated for children under by their
age and sex based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
CDC Standard Deviation derived Growth Reference Curves which are
derived from the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS CDC
Reference Population Le and Nguyen Child s anthropometric
measures reflect the nutrition and growth status of children in both the
long run and the short run Thomas et al WHO
These
anthropometric measures are described as the number of standard
deviations below or above the median of the international reference
population
Contraceptive use
The survey also provides information on a couple s contraceptive
use Specifically the respondents are asked have you ever used any
thing or tried to avoid or delay getting pregnant Here the contra
ceptive methods may include using a contraceptive pill injections
IUD condoms sterilization rhythmic periodic abstinence withdrawal
lactational amenorrhea foam jelly female condom and standard days
method We do not differentiate between the methods of contraception
and define our variable of interest as Everused such that it takes value
if the couple has ever used any of these contraceptive methods or
tried to delay pregnancy and O otherwise

The assignment of the z scores based on the WHO Child Growth Standards
is done through a complicated interpolation function that takes into account
sex age measured by the difference in date of birth and date of interview
both precise to the day of the month height in centimeters and weight in
kilograms precise to grams The z scores are calculated using software
based on the WHO Anthro program and the macros for statistical packages at

bias and that the most straightforward approach to such concerns
is to include controls that can be observed we incorporate a va
riety of child woman and household controls chosen carefully and
comprehensively in our baseline estimations Our child level controls
include birth order whether the child is a twin multiple birth the
child s birth size age sex and whether the child has received polio
BCG DPT and measles vaccinations The mother s controls include
age education level and body mass index BMI to incorporate a
measure of her general health status whether she is covered by health
insurance intake of iron supplements during pregnancy and frequency
of antenatal visits during pregnancy Household level controls include
wealth index indicators of residence in a rural or urban area indicators
for religion Hindu Muslim Christian or other religions including Sikh
Jain Buddhist and others and caste Backward or other
Descriptive patterns analytical sample
Our analytical sample consists of observations
Table
presents the descriptive statistics of the variables used in our analysis
Mean HAZ is at standard deviations SD and mean WAZ is at
SD Our variable of interest Everused suggests that almost
percent of women have used some contraceptive method
In terms of child demographics roughly of the
sample consists of girls boys and the average age of a child is
approximately months Only about of the children are twins
or belonged to a multiple birth and approximately of children
are average or above in size at birth Approximately of children
have received the polio vaccination have the DPT vaccinations
and the BCG measles vaccinations
An average woman s age is approximately years have
completed primary education and approximately of women are
covered by health insurance On average around of women
received some iron supplements during pregnancy and had roughly
antenatal visits during pregnancy to the healthcare center
Demographics at the household level suggest that an average house
hold in our analytical sample belongs to the poor to middle income
category in
