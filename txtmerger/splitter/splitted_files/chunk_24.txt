with different topologies were trained and the performance of each
network was assessed based on the testing validation and train
ing dataset application For training the MLP network the dataset
was randomly split into training validation and test
ing data For the RBF network we randomly split the dataset
into training and testing data
Evaluation of the networks and development of the CDSS
In order to evaluate and select the most accurate network we
used a confusion matrix and calculated the percentage of sensi
tivity specificity and accuracy of each network In addition the
performance of the networks was evaluated by the receiver oper
ating characteristic ROC curve and the area under the ROC curve
AUC Maximizing AUC indicates a satisfying classification
In addition for the selected MLP and RBF networks we used fold
cross validation too All calculations were based on the standard
equations published elsewhere
Finally we developed the
CDSS based on the most accurate network MATLAB software
was applied to design the CDSS

Discussion
Predicting the outcome of pregnancy in women with SLE and
providing proper and effective care for these patients can increase
the expectancy of foetal survival for families However predict
ing this problem is still complicated because of the multiplicity
of affecting variables and the complexity of their relationships
with regard to this problem We developed a CDSS for predict
ing pregnancy outcomes among SLE affected women We applied
two neural networks for this prediction According to the results
accuracy of MLP and RBF networks for the test data was and
respectively In addition the MLP outperformed RBF net
works using the total data
Although to the best of our knowledge there are no other
studies related to developing models using neural networks or
other machine learning algorithms for predicting the pregnancy
outcomes of SLE affected women researchers successfully applied
neural networks for either multivariate analysis or predicting a
range of diseases or for disease risk estimation
According to
the previous research the performance of the classification algo
rithms especially neural networks may be different from one

dataset to another
However in most studies in which the
performance of different neural networks has been compared the
MLP network performance was better than the others in the field
of prediction task of medicine a result that is consistent with our
findings For example a study was conducted by Bovis et al to iden
tify masses in digital mammograms using both the MLP and the
RBF based on Gaussian kernels networks in the UK This study
revealed that the MLP network with the best performance showed
an AUC value of in contrast to the AUC value of RBF
In addition Kurt et al compared the performance of classification
methods in order to predict the presence of coronary artery dis
ease CAD and found that areas under the ROC curves were
and for MLP logistic regression LR clas
sification and regression tree CART and RBF respectively
The
better accuracy of the MLP networks has been confirmed for pre
dicting and classifying other medical conditions such as internal
carotid arteries ICA stenosis vs middle cerebral
artery MCA stenosis vs and thyroid diseases
based on different learning algorithms vs
However there are studies indicating that RBF performance may
be somewhat better than the MLP in some areas such as predict
ing the risk of essential hypertension disease vs
Therefore researchers should avoid making a conclusion based on
only one method The decision of a method selection should be
made based on a comparison between different methods applied
to a specific dataset
As our results indicate the MLP network with a scaled
conjugate gradient trainscg back propagation learning algorithm
with accuracy had the best performance The network con
sisted of sigmoid functions and neurons in the single hidden
layer and a log sigmoid function and one neuron in the output
layer Therefore we applied this model to develop a CDSS
The risk of undesirable foetal outcomes estimation in the early
first trimester of pregnancy by rheumatologists may guarantee
a desirable pregnancy outcome When an SLE affected pregnant
woman is visited for the first time by a rheumatologist the lat
ter enters the values of effective factors into the developed
which then predicts the outcome of the pregnancy
CDSS
Fig
in two classes spontaneous abortion and live birth by a click on
the button for pregnancy outcome in the designed system In this
way the rheumatologist can decide optimally about the patient
and her treatment While the system predicts spontaneous abor
tion for one case that case should be considered as high risk
In this setting the expert rheumatologist can start to manage the
pregnancy more skilfully to have a favourable outcome in these
high risk pregnancies by regular monitoring and the recommen
dation to take appropriate medications during pregnancy adjusted
to the patient s medical history and risk factors
It is generally
accepted that systematic monitoring is needed for all SLE affected
women to improve their pregnancy outcome
Thus more fre
quent specific care and interventions are required for the mothers
for whom the system predicts spontaneous abortion rather than
those for whom the system predicts live birth this may ensure
correct planning and management of care for these patients
In addition many women with SLE discontinue their medications
when they find themselves pregnant
Thereby awareness of
the risk for the mothers can help to manage the condition prop
erly with regard to alterations in their medications and appropriate
counselling by some recommended continuation and discontinu
ation of the medications
Therefore rheumatologists can
decrease the effect of specific factors associated with incidence
of spontaneous abortion in SLE affected women until delivery by
specifically maintaining and monitoring the mother It can improve
the health of the mother and maximize the chances of a successful
delivery
Hence this system may be effective to reduce
the risk of foetal loss
Some limitations should be considered in this research Most
cases of pregnant patients with SLE were excluded due to a large
quantity of missing data in their medical records or the related
databases Therefore the results may not be generalizable In addi
tion we could not access data about five variables anti Ro ss A
and anti La ss B antibodies anti glycoprotein I antibody anti
serum albumin level and antihypertensive use Finally we
removed these five variables Therefore conducting similar studies
with a larger dataset is recommended
In this study we replaced missing data Although this approach
is a standard pre processing technique it might result in bias We
re built the selected MLP network without replacing any missing
data According to the results the accuracy of this new network
was
In addition we first identified important features based on the
literature review and then selected the most important ones using
logistic regression For comparison we re developed the network
without any feature selection The results indicated that the accu
racy sensitivity and specificity of this new network were
and respectively These results show that the network

Physiological changes in pregnancy
Priya Soma Pillay Catherine Nelson Piercy Heli Tolppanen Alexandre Mebazaa
Abstract
Physiological changes occur in pregnancy to nurture the
developing foetus and prepare the mother for labour and
delivery Some of these changes influence normal biochemical
values while others may mimic symptoms of medical disease
It is important to differentiate between normal physiological
changes and disease pathology This review highlights the
important changes that take place during normal pregnancy

During pregnancy the pregnant mother undergoes significant
anatomical and physiological changes in order to nurture and
accommodate the developing foetus These changes begin after
conception and affect every organ system in the body l For
most women experiencing an uncomplicated pregnancy these
changes resolve after pregnancy with minimal residual effects
It is important to understand the normal physiological changes
occurring in pregnancy as this will help differentiate from
adaptations that are abnormal
Haematological changes
Plasma volume increases progressively throughout normal
pregnancy Most of this increase occurs by weeks

gestation and is proportional to the birthweight of the baby
Because the expansion in plasma volume is greater than the
increase in red blood cell mass there is a fall in haemoglobin
concentration haematocrit and red blood cell count Despite this
haemodilution there is usually no change in mean corpuscular
volume MCV or mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration
MCHC
The platelet count tends to fall progressively during normal
pregnancy although it usually remains within normal limits
In a proportion of women the count will reach levels
of x cells l by term and this occurs in the absence
of any pathological process In practice therefore a woman is
not considered to be thrombocytopenic in pregnancy until the
platelet count is less than x cells l
Pregnancy causes a two to three fold increase in the
requirement for iron not only for haemoglobin synthesis but
also for for the foetus and the production of certain enzymes
There is a to fold increase in folate requirements and a
two fold increase in the requirement for vitamin BE
Changes in the coagulation system during pregnancy
produce a physiological hypercoagulable state in preparation
for haemostasis following delivery The concentrations
of certain clotting factors particularly VIII IX and X are
increased Fibrinogen levels rise significantly by up to and
fibrinolytic activity is decreased Concentrations of endogenous
anticoagulants such as antithrombin and protein S decrease
Thus pregnancy alters the balance within the coagulation system
in favour of clotting predisposing the pregnant and postpartum
woman to venous thrombosis This increased risk is present from
the first trimester and for at least weeks following delivery In
vitro tests of coagulation activated partial thromboplastin time
APT T prothrombin time PT and thrombin time TT remain
normal in the absence of anticoagulants or a coagulopathy
Venous stasis in the lower limbs is associated with venodilation
and decreased flow which is more marked on the left This is due
to compression of the left iliac vein by the left iliac artery and
the ovarian artery On the right the iliac artery does not cross
the vein
Cardiac changes
Changes in the cardiovascular system in pregnancy are profound
and begin early in pregnancy such that by eight weeks gestation
the cardiac output has already increased by The primary
event is probably peripheral vasodilatation This is mediated
by endothelium dependent factors including nitric oxide
synthesis upregulated by oestradiol and possibly vasodilatory
prostaglandins Peripheral vasodilation leads to a
fall in systemic vascular resistance and to compensate for this
cardiac output increases by around during pregnancy This
is achieved predominantly via an increase in stroke volume but
also to a lesser extent an increase in heart rate The maximum
cardiac output is found at about weeks gestation There is
a minimal fall at term
CARDIOVASCULAR JOURNAL OF AFRICA Volume No March April
An increase in stroke volume is possible due to the early
increase in ventricular wall muscle mass and end diastolic
volume but not end diastolic pressure seen in pregnancy The
heart is physiologically dilated and myocardial contractility
is increased Although stroke volume declines towards term
the increase in maternal heart rate bpm is maintained
thus preserving the increased cardiac output Blood pressure
decreases in the first and second trimesters but increases to
non pregnant levels in the third trimester
There is a profound effect of maternal position towards
term upon the haemodynamic profile of both the mother and
foetus In the supine position pressure of the gravid uterus on
the inferior vena cava IVC causes a reduction in venous return
to the heart and a consequent fall in stroke volume and cardiac
output Turning from the lateral to the supine position may
result in a reduction in cardiac output Pregnant women
should therefore be nursed in the left or right lateral position
wherever possible If the woman has to be kept on her back
the pelvis should be rotated so that the uterus drops to the side
and off the IVC and cardiac output and uteroplacental blood
flow are optimised Reduced cardiac output is associated with
a reduction in uterine blood flow and therefore in placental
perfusion which could compromise the foetus
Although both blood volume and stroke volume increase
in pregnancy pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central
venous pressure do not increase significantly Pulmonary vascular
resistance PVR like systemic vascular resistance SVR
decreases significantly in normal pregnancy Although there is no
increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure PCWP serum
colloid osmotic pressure is reduced by The colloid
osmotic pressure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure gradient
is reduced by about making pregnant women particularly
susceptible to pulmonary oedema Pulmonary oedema will be
precipitated if there is either an increase in cardiac pre load
such as infusion of fluids or increased pulmonary capillary
permeability such as in pre eclampsia or both
Labour is associated with further increases in cardiac output
in the first stage and in the second stage Uterine
contractions lead to an auto transfusion of ml of blood
back into the circulation and the sympathetic response to pain
and anxiety further elevate the heart rate and blood pressure
Cardiac output is increased between contractions but more so
during contractions
Following delivery there is an immediate rise in cardiac
output due to relief of the inferior vena cava obstruction and
contraction of the uterus which empties blood into the systemic
circulation Cardiac output increases by followed by
a rapid decline to pre labour values within about one hour of
delivery Transfer of fluid from the extravascular space increases
venous return and stroke volume further
Those women with cardiovascular compromise are therefore
most at risk of pulmorary oedema during the second stage of
labour and the immediate postpartum period Cardiac output
has nearly returned to normal pre pregnancy values two
weeks after delivery although some pathological changes e g
hypertension in pre eclampsia may take much longer
The above physiological changes lead to changes on
cardiovascular examination that may be misinterpreted as
pathological by those unfamiliar with pregnancy Changes may
include a bounding or collapsing pulse and an ejection systolic
murmur present in over of pregnant women The murmur
may be loud and audible all over the precordium with the first
heart sound loud and possibly sometimes a third heart sound
There may be ectopic beats and peripheral oedema
Normal findings on ECG in pregnancy that may partly relate
to changes in the position of the heart include
atrial and ventricular ectopics
Q wave small and inverted T wave in lead III
ST segment depression and T wave inversion in the inferior
and lateral leads
left axis shift of QRS
Adaptive changes in renal vasculature
The primary adaptive mechanism in pregnancy is a marked fall
in systemic vascular resistance SVR occurring by week six of
gestation The fall in SVR also affects the renal vasculature
Despite a major increase in plasma volume during pregnancy the
massive decrease in SVR creates a state of arterial under filling
because of the volume resides in the venous circulation
This arterial under filling state is unique to pregnancy The fall
in SVR is combined with increased renal blood flow and this is in
contrast to other states of arterial under filling such as cirrhosis
sepsis or arterio venous fistulas
Relaxin a peptide hormone produced by the corpus luteum
decidua and placenta plays an important role in the regulation
of haemodynamic and water metabolism during pregnancy
Serum concentrations of relaxin already elevated in the luteal
phase of the menstrual cycle rise after conception to a peak at
the end of the first trimester and fall to an intermediate value
throughout the second and third trimester Relaxin stimulates
the formation of endothelin which in turn mediates vasodilation
of renal arteries via nitric oxide NO synthesis
Despite activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone
RAA system in early pregnancy a simultaneous relative
resistance to angiotensin II develops counterbalancing the
vasoconstrictive effect and allowing profound vasodilatation
This insensitivity to angiotensin II may be explained by the
effects of progesterone and vascular endothelial growth factor
mediated prostacyclin production as well as modifications in
the angiotensin I receptors during pregnancy The vascular
refractoriness to angiotensin II may also be shared by other
vasoconstrictors such as adrenergic agonists and arginine
vasopressin AVP IO It is possible that in the second half of
pregnancy the placental vasodilatators are more important in
the maintenance of the vasodilatatory state
Changes in renal anatomy and function
As a consequence of renal vasodilatation renal plasma flow
and glomerular filtration rate GFR both increase compared
to non pregnant levels by and respectively In
addition the increase in plasma volume causes decreased oncotic
pressure in the glomeruli with a subsequent rise in GFR II
Vascular resistance decreases in both the renal afferent and
efferent arterioles and therefore despite the massive increase in
renal plasma flow glomerular hydrostatic pressure remains stable
avoiding the development of glomerular hypertension As the
GFR rises both serum creatinine and urea concentrations decrease
to mean values of about gmol l and mmol l respectively
CARDIOVASCULAR JOURNAL OF AFRICA Volume No March April
The increased renal blood flow leads to an increase in renal
size of cm reaching the maximal size by mid pregnancy
The kidney pelvis and calyceal systems dilate due to mechanical
compressive forces on the ureters Progesterone which reduces
ureteral tone peristalsis and contraction pressure mediates these
anatomical changes II The increase in renal size is associated with
an increase in renal vasculature interstitial volume and urinary
dead space There is also dilation of the ureters renal pelvis
and calyces leading to physiological hydronephrosis in over
of women There is often a right sided predominance of
hydronephrosis due to the anatomical circumstances of the right
ureter crossing the iliac and ovarian vessels at an angle before
entering the pelvis Urinary stasis in the dilated collecting system
predisposes pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria to
pyelonephritis
There are also alterations in the tubular handling of wastes
and nutrients As in the non pregnant state glucose is freely
filtered in the glomerulus During pregnancy the reabsorption of
glucose in the proximal and collecting tubule is less effective with
variable excretion About of pregnant women with normal
blood glucose levels excrete g of glucose per day Due to the
increases in both GFR and glomerular capillary permeability to
albumin the fractional excretion of protein may increase up to
mg day and protein excretion also increases In normal pregnancies
the total protein concentration in urine does not increase above
the upper normal limit Uric acid excretion also increases due to
increased GFR and or decreased tubular reabsorption II
Body water metabolism
Arterial under filling in pregnancy leads to the stimulation of
arterial baroreceptors activating the RAA and the sympathetic
nervous systems This results in a non osmotic release of AVP
from the hypothalamus These changes lead to sodium and
water retention in the kidneys and create a hypervolaemic hypo
osmolar state characteristic of pregnancy Extracellular volume
increases by and plasma volume by Maternal
blood volume increases by to approximately to
ml above non pregnant values By the late third trimester the
plasma volume increases by more than with a lower
increase in red blood cell mass and therefore plasma osmolality
falls by mosmol kg The increase in plasma volume plays
a critical role in maintaining circulating blood volume blood
pressure and uteroplacental perfusion during pregnancy
Activation of the RAA system leads to increased plasma
levels of aldosterone and subsequent salt and water retention in
the distal tubule and collecting duct In addition to the increased
renin production by the kidneys ovaries and uteroplacental
unit produce an inactive precursor protein of renin in early
pregnancy The placenta also produces oestrogens that
stimulate the synthesis of angiotensinogen by the liver resulting
in proportionally increased levels of aldosterone compared to
renin Plasma levels of aldosterone correlate well with those of
oestrogens and rise progressively during pregnancy The increase
in aldosterone is responsible for the increase in plasma volume
during pregnancy Progesterone which is a potent aldosterone
antagonist allows natriuresis despite the sodium retaining
properties of aldosterone The rise in GFR also increases
distal sodium delivery allowing excretion of excess sodium
Progesterone has antikaliuretic effects and therefore excretion of
potassium is kept constant throughout pregnancy due to changes
in tubular reabsorption and total body potassium increases
during pregnancy
Hypothalamic AVP release increases early in pregnancy as a
result of increased relaxin levels AVP mediates an increase in water
reabsorption via aquaporin channels in the collecting duct The
threshold for hypothalamic secretion of AVP and the threshold
for thirst is reset to a lower plasma osmolality level creating the
hypo osmolar state characteristic of pregnancy These changes are
mediated by human chorionic gonadotropin hCG and relaxin
In middle and late pregnancy there is a four fold increase in
vasopressinase an aminopeptidase produced by the placenta
These changes enhance the metabolic clearance of vasopressin
and regulate the levels of active AVP In conditions of increased
placental production of vasopressinase such as pre eclampsia or
twin pregnancies a transient diabetes insipidus may develop I
As a consequence of this volume expansion the secretion of
atrial natriuretic peptides increases by in the third trimester
and rises further during the first week postpartum The levels of
natriuretic peptides are higher in pregnant women with chronic
hypertension and pre eclampsia
Respiratory changes
There is a significant increase in oxygen demand during normal
pregnancy This is due to a increase in the metabolic rate
and a increased consumption of oxygen There is a
increase in minute ventilation mostly due to an increase in
tidal volume rather than in the respiratory rate This maternal
hyperventilation causes arterial to increase and arterial
to fall with a compensatory fall in serum bicarbonate to
mmol l see Table A mild fully compensated respiratory
alkalosis is therefore normal in pregnancy arterial pH
Diaphragmatic elevation in late pregnancy results in decreased
functional residual capacity but diaphragmatic excursion and
therefore vital capacity remain unaltered Inspiratory reserve
volume is reduced early in pregnancy as a result of increased
tidal volume but increases in the third trimester as a result of
reduced functional residual capacity see Fig Peak expiratory
flow rate PEFR and forced expiratory volume in one second
FEVI are unaffected by pregnancy
Pregnancy may also be accompanied by a subjective feeling of
breathlessness without hypoxia This is physiological and is most
common in the third trimester but may start at any time during
gestation Classically the breathlessness is present at rest or while
talking and may paradoxically improve during mild activity
Adaptive changes in the alimentary tract
Nausea and vomiting are very common complaints in pregnancy

mechanism of pregnancy aiming at preventing pregnant women
from consuming potentially teratogenic substances such as
strong tasting fruits and vegetables The exact underlying
mechanism is not clear but pregnancy associated hormones
such as human chorionic gonadotropin hCG oestrogen and
progesterone could to be involved in the aetiology The levels of
hCG peak at the end of the first trimester when the trophoblast
is most actively producing hCG correlating with the nausea
symptoms Nausea is also more frequent in pregnancies with
high levels of hCG such as in twin pregnancies
Thyroid hormones may also be involved in the development
of nausea symptoms as a strong association with nausea and
abnormal thyroid function tests has been found Thyroid
stimulating hormone TSH and hCG have similar biomolecular
structures and therefore hCG cross reacts with TSH stimulating
the thyroid gland Psychological causes genetic incompatibility
immunological factors nutritional deficiencies as well as
Helicobacter pylori infection have been proposed as aetiological
factors of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy
The nausea symptoms usually resolve by week but
about of the patients experience symptoms beyond
week and some until the end of the pregnancy In most
cases minor dietary modification and observation of electrolyte
balance is sufficient About of pregnant women develop
hyperemesis gravidum a severe form of nausea and excessive
vomiting often resulting in dehydration electrolyte imbalance
ketonuria weight loss and vitamin or mineral deficiencies
In these cases intravenous fluid and vitamin substitution is
commonly required Thiamine supplementation is important in
order to avoid the development of Wernicke s encephalopathy
As pregnancy progresses mechanical changes in the
alimentary tract also occur caused by the growing uterus The
stomach is increasingly displaced upwards leading to an altered
axis and increased intra gastric pressure The oesophageal
sphincter tone is also decreased and these factors may predispose
to symptoms of reflux as well as nausea and vomiting
Changes in oestrogen and progesterone levels also influence
the structural alterations in the gastrointestinal tract These
include abnormalities in gastric neural activity and smooth
muscle function leading to gastic dysrhythmia or gastroparesis
The alterations are pronounced in women with pre existing

Endocrine changes
Thyroid
There is an increase in the production of thyroxine binding globulin
TBG by the liver resulting in increased levels of thyroxine TO
and tri iodothyronine T Serum free T IT and T levels
are slightly altered but are usually of no clinical significance Levels
of free T and do however decrease slightly in the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy and the normal ranges are reduced
Free T and T are the physiologically important hormones and are
the main determinants of whether a patient is euthyroid
Serum concentrations of TSH are decreased slightly in the
first trimester in response to the thyrotropic effects of increased
levels of human chorionic gonadotropin Levels of TSH increase
again at the end of the first trimester and the upper limit in
pregnancy is raised to gmol l compared with the level of
gmol l in the non pregnant state Table
Pregnancy is associated with a relative iodine deficiency The
causes for this are active transport of iodine from the mother
to the foeto placental unit and increased iodine excretion in the
urine The World Health Organisation recommends an increase
in iodine intake in pregnancy from to mg day If
iodine intake is maintained in pregnancy the size of the thyroid
gland remains unchanged and therefore the presence of goiter
should always be investigated The thyroid gland is larger in
patients who are iodine deficient
Adrenal gland
Three types of steroids are produced by the adrenal glands
mineralocorticoids glucocorticoids and sex steroids The RAA
system is stimulated due to reductions in vascular resistance and
blood pressure causing a three fold increase in aldosterone levels
in the first trimester and a fold increase in the third trimester
Levels of angiotensin II are increased two to four fold and renin
activity is increased three to four times that of non pregnant values
During pregnancy there is also an increase in serum levels
of deoxycorticosterone corticosteroid binding globulin CBG
adrenocorticotropic hormone ACT H cortisol and free cortisol
These changes cause a state of physiological hypercortisolism and
may be clinically manifested by the striae facial plethora rising
blood pressure or impaired glucose tolerance Total cortisol levels
increase at the end of the first trimester and are three times higher
than non pregnant values at the end of pregnancy Hypercortisolism
in late pregnancy is also the result of the production of corticotropin
releasing hormone by the placenta one of the triggers for the onset
of labour Diurnal variations in ACTH and cortisol levels are
maintained The hypothalamic pituitary axis response to exogenous
glucocorticoids is blunted during pregnancy

Pituitary gland
The pituitary gland enlarges in pregnancy and this is mainly due
to proliferation of prolactin producing cells in the anterior lobe
Serum prolactin levels increase in the first trimester and are
times higher at term The increase in prolactin is most likely due
to increasing serum oestradiol concentrations during pregnancy
Levels of follicle stimulating hormone FSH and luteinising
hormone LH are undetectable during pregnancy due to the
negative feedback from elevated levels of oestrogen progesterone
and inhibin Pituitary growth hormone production is decreased
but serum growth hormone levels are increased due to growth
hormone production from the placenta
The posterior pituitary produces oxytocin and arginine
vasopressin AVP Oxytocin levels increase in pregnancy
and peak at term Levels of antidiuretic hormone ADH
remain unchanged but the decrease in sodium concentration in
pregnancy causes a decrease in osmolality There is therefore a
resetting of osmoreceptors for ADH release and thirst
Glucose metabolism
Pregnancy is a diabetogenic state and the adaptations in glucose
metabolism allow shunting of glucose to the foetus to promote
development while maintaining adequate maternal nutrition
Insulin secreting pancreatic beta cells undergo hyperplasia resulting
in increased insulin secretion and increased insulin sensitivity in
early pregnancy followed by progressive insulin resistance
Maternal insulin resistance begins in the second trimester
and peaks in the third trimester This is the result of increasing
secretion of diabetogenic hormones such as human placental
lactogen growth hormone progesterone cortisol and prolactin
These hormones cause a decrease in insulin sensitivity in the
peripheral tissues such as adipocytes and skeletal muscle by
interfering with insulin receptor signalling The effect of
the placental hormones on insulin sensitivity is made evident
postpartum when there is a sudden decrease in insulin resistance
Insulin levels are increased in both the fasting and postprandial
states in pregnancy Fasting glucose levels are however decreased
due to
increased storage of tissue glycogen
increased peripheral glucose use
decrease in glucose production by the liver
uptake of glucose by the foetus
Insulin resistance and relative hypoglycaemia results in lipolysis
allowing the pregnant mother to preferentially use fat for fuel
preserving the available glucose and amino acids for the foetus and
minimising protein catabolism The placenta allows transfer of
glucose amino acids and ketones to the foetus but is impermeable
to large lipids If a woman s endocrine pancreatic function is
impaired and she is unable to overcome the insulin resistance
associated with pregnancy then gestational diabetes develops
Lipid metabolism
There is an increase in total serum cholesterol and triglyceride
levels in pregnancy The increase in triglyceride levels is mainly as a
result of increased synthesis by the liver and decreased lipoprotein
lipase activity resulting in decreased catabolism of adipose tissue
Low density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol levels also increase
and reach at term High density lipoprotein levels increase
in the first half of pregnancy and fall in the third trimester but
concentrations are higher than non pregnant levels
Changes in lipid metabolism accommodate the needs of the
developing foetus Increased triglyceride levels provide for the
mother s energy needs while glucose is spared for the foetus
The increase in LDL cholesterol is important for placental
steroidogenesis
Protein metabolism
Pregnant women require an increased intake of protein during
pregnancy Amino acids are actively transported across the
placenta to fulfill the needs of the developing foetus During
pregnancy protein catabolism is decreased as fat stores are used
to provide for energy metabolism
Calcium metabolism
The average foetus requires about g of calcium to maintain its
physiological processes Most of this calcium is transferred to the
foetus during the third trimester and is derived from increased
dietary absorption by the mother There is a decrease in total
serum calcium concentration during pregnancy This is mainly
due to a decrease in serum albumin levels due to haemodilution
resulting in a decrease in the albumin bound fraction of calcium
However the physiologically important fraction serum ionised
calcium remains unchanged Therefore maternal serum levels
of calcium are maintained during pregnancy and foetal needs are
met by increased intestinal absorption which doubles from
weeks gestation However the peak demand for calcium is only
in the third trimester This early increase in calcium absorption
may allow the maternal skeleton to store calcium in advance l
Serum levels of hydroxyvitamin D increase and this is
metabolised further into I dihydroxyvitamin D The increase
in dihydroxyvitamin D is directly responsible for the
increase in intestinal calcium absorption
Increased calcium absorption is associated with an increase in
calcium excretion in the urine and these changes begin from
weeks During periods of fasting urinary calcium values are low
or normal confirming that hypercalciuria is the consequence of
increased absorption Pregnancy is therefore a risk factor for
kidney stones
Skeletal and bone density changes
There is controversy regarding the effect of pregnancy on maternal
bone loss Although pregnancy and lactation are associated with
reversible bone loss studies do not support an association between
parity and osteoporosis in later life Bone turnover is low in the
first trimester and increases in the third trimester when foetal
calcium needs are increased The source of the calcium in the third
trimester is previously stored skeletal calcium
A study of bone biopsies in pregnancy has shown a change
in the micro architectural pattern of bone in pregnancy but not
overall bone mass The changes reflect the need for the maternal
skeleton to be resistant to bending forces and biochemical
stresses needed to carry the growing foetus
Other musculoskeletal changes seen in pregnancy include
exaggerated lordosis of the lower back forward flexion of the
neck and downward movement of the shoulders
