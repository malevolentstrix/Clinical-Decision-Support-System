gestation to investigate the prevention of GDM using a behavioural antenatal lifestyle intervention
supported by a smartphone application in pregnancies complicated by overweight and obesity Maternal written
informed consent was acquired at study enrolment The PEARS participants were stratified by BMI and randomly
assigned into control standard antenatal care and intervention additional dietary and physical activity advice
with reinforcement using mHealth technology groups During the PEARS study a variety of data were collected
from these participants including maternal characteristics blood biomarkers ultrasound measurements food
intake exercise and lifestyle behaviors maternal and neonatal outcomes GDM was diagnosed according to the
International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups IADPSG at approximately
weeks gestation
In this research we excluded PEARS participants who dropped out or were excluded from the PEARS study
and those without available GDM diagnostics As a result PEARS participants were included Because the
PEARS study did not find any significant difference between the incidence of GDM in the control and interven
tion group we did not consider the impact of the PEARS intervention in this research
As we aimed to predict GDM in early pregnancy the descriptive features used are clinical data collected at
the PEARS randomisation visit weeks gestation also referred to as the baseline These features are
maternal anthropometry demographic characteristics family history and blood biomarkers They are described
in Table
Figure shows the workflow overview of this research
Data preparation Many features included in this research have missing values as shown in Fig We
dropped features with greater than missing values complement component C reactive protein
CRP leptin and adiponectin The missing values in the remaining features were imputed Several imputation
methods were considered median or mean for numerical features and mode for categorical features k Nearest
Neighbors kNN imputation and iterative imputation In order to select the best imputation method for our
dataset we extracted the complete cases of the dataset and generated missing values in these cases fol
lowing the same missing pattern in the entire dataset This is done by randomly selecting instances from the
entire dataset and copying the feature missingness in these instances into the complete cases Then we imputed
these generated missing values using the candidate imputation methods and calculated the mean absolute error
MAE between the imputed and true values after a min max scaler As shown in Fig mean mode impu
tation achieved the highest MAE followed by median mode imputation and kNN imputation with different
parameters Iterative imputation achieved the lowest MAE showing that this method is able to generate imputed
values closest to the real values for this dataset Therefore we applied the iterative imputation to impute the miss
ing values in the dataset
of the participants included were white therefore participants from other ethnic origins were held
out as an independent cross cultural ethnic test set After that of the white participants in the dataset
stratified by the GDM diagnosis were randomly selected as the training set The remaining was used as an
independent test set
Feature selection First of all we aimed to remove redundant features to avoid the curse of dimension
ality and reduce the number of inputs required to use the models in a clinical setting Figure shows the
Pearson correlation between features We defined redundant features as those with correlation greater than
As a result maternal weight BMI and mid upper arm circumference MUAC insulin and C peptide and total
cholesterol and Low Density Lipoprotein LDL cholesterol were deemed to be redundant This is consistent
with the medical knowledge weight BMI and MUAC are all anthropometric measurements that provide assess
ment of nutritional status and BMI is derived from height and weight Insulin and C peptide are released from
the pancreas at the same time and the same rate LDL cholesterol is calculated from total cholesterol High Den
sity Lipoprotein HDL cholesterol and triglycerides To reduce feature redundancy we removed features with
higher percentage of missing values prior to imputation see Fig to minimise the impact of imputation and
ensure the credibility of data As a result MUAC and C peptide are removed The remaining redundant features
that have the same level of missing values are weight and BMI and LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol Ihe
latter of each pair is calculated from the former Among them we removed derived features BMI LDL choles
terol and kept the original features weight total cholesterol to save computational time
Moreover we conducted the feature selection process in close collaboration with clinical experts In the
existing literature there is conflicting evidence reporting both positive and negative relationships with GDM
and maternal education level a indicator of socioeconomic In our dataset the average education level
is higher in GDM participants than non GDM participants which can be explained by the positive relationship
between maternal age and education This is consistent with the indirect effect of maternal education on GDM
through high pre pregnancy BMI and older age that Bertolotto et al suggested based on data collected in Italy
However a cohort study in the Netherlands suggests low educated women have an increased risk of
In order for our modeling results to be generalisable among different populations and to avoid confusion in a
clinical setting we removed education in consultation with clinical experts

In order to develop a clinically usable CDSS we aimed to develop multiple models for different use cases
Model was designed to be theoretical and feature agnostic where all included features were considered candi
dates and acts as a baseline Model was designed to be more usable and to fit into clinical routine easily Fasting
blood biomarkers fasting glucose insulin C peptide lipid profile total cholesterol HDL cholesterol triglycer
ides were excluded because pregnant women do not normally attend an antenatal visit fasted and fasting blood
biomarkers are not routinely assessed Also excluding these features can reduce the cost for a GDM prediction
Pobal HP deprivation index a measurement of the women s socioeconomic status based on the geographical
area of their residence was excluded because it is only available in Ireland and it limits the applicability of our
model to other regions Model was designed to work in remote settings without a hospital visit so all features
that cannot be recalled or measured outside of a clinical setting were excluded In addition to features removed
in Model for example all blood biomarkers Also Pobal HP deprivation index was excluded All included
features for each model are further selected during cross validation described in Section Modeling

data modeling In our dataset of white women were diagnosed with GDM at approximately
gestational weeks which means the dataset is highly unbalanced For each model we applied sequential steps
of synthetic minority oversampling technique SMOTE feature selection by the highest ANOVA F values and
machine learning with each algorithm on the training set in a pipeline The number of nearest neighbors used
to construct synthetical samples in SMOTE is set to three The number of top features to select from one to the
total number of candidate features as well as hyper parameters for each algorithm were tuned using balanced
accuracy as the evaluation metric in a stratified five fold cross validated grid search The hyper parameters
tuned for each algorithm can be found in Table Probability estimates are enabled so that the models false
positive rate are adjustable for different settings All other parameters were set to the default

Finally the models performance on the independent cross cultural ethnic test set is evaluated using the
same evaluation metrics to investigate if the models which are trained on white data generalise well to non
white population
Explainability Logistic regression models are inherently transparent and explainable Random forest
SVM AdaBoost and XGBoost models are more algorithmic complex making it more diffcult for clinicians to
understand how predictions are made For such models we applied Kernel a model agnostic game the
oretic post hoc interpretation method to improve model explainability SHAP is a unified approach of feature
importance with desirable properties and it provides both explanations for the structure of the model global
explainability and for a specific prediction local explainability SHAP was applied to improve explainability
for a machine learning based CDSS in In our research global feature importance is calculated by
the averaged absolute SHAP values of the entire independent test set for each feature to help users gain insight
of the overall behavior of the model Furthermore we used SHAP values of a particular instance to explain how
each feature and its value contribute to the predicted GDM risk for this participant

Model achieved similar overall performance on the non white and white population giving an AUC PR of
and an AUC ROC of However at the decision threshold of the model is able to correctly predict

From the comparison of the model performance on the independent test set and the independent cross
cultural ethnic test set we found that our models especially Model and achieved high specificity but low
sensitivity at the decision threshold of on the independent cross cultural ethnic test set although similar
overall performance AUC PR and AUC ROC was observed In order to achieve an unbiased performance a
lower decision threshold for non white population is required As a result we conclude that our GDM prediction
models require a lower decision threshold to generalise to a non white population
Implementation and worked example Our models have been implemented as a web server which
serves as a CDSS prototype The prototype allows users to submit the values for features required and it predicts
the probability that the person will develop GDM It also provides explanations in order for users to understand
and trust the predictions The prototype is freely available for academic use at http lisda ucd ie GDM risk
calculator
To test the prototype we selected two test cases which are similar but have different outcomes from the
independent test set see Table The two cases have similar values in most of the maternal characteristics except
for weight Case the GDM participant has extremely high weight while Case the non GDM participant
has below average weight Regarding blood biomarkers Case and have similar white cell count but Case
has higher fasting glucose and insulin than Case
Suppose a user wants to test our CDSS prototype on these cases They can simply enter the feature values for
each case into the corresponding input boxes on the web page and press the calculate button to get the results
The CDSS will present the predicted risk for the case as well as the explanations
Both cases were predicted correctly by Model and The predicted GDM risks for Case and are
and by Model and by Model and and by Model
Our models are SVM based models and they are explained by Kernel SHAP in a post hoc manner Figure
shows the features ranked by their the global feature importance based on mean absolute SHAP values in all
models Fasting glucose plays the most important role in Model achieving mean absolute SHAP values much
higher than all other features White cell count and weight are then of importance followed by family history
of DM and insulin In Model weight is the most important feature followed by maternal age and white cell
count Gestational age and family history of DM play a less important role in Model In Model maternal age
is the most important predictor followed by weight gestational age and family history of DM
Figure shows the the local feature contribution based on SHAP values for Case and as well as the pre
dicted GDM risk A blue band indicates that the feature is dragging the prediction down to class non GDM
while a pink band shows that the feature leads to an increase in the predicted GDM risk The length of the band
indicates the magnitude of the effect It can be seen that the feature contributing the most to the opposite outcome
of Case and in Model is fasting glucose The fasting glucose of mmol L largely increases the predicted
GDM risk for Case but the fasting glucose of mmol L decreases the risk for Case greatly This makes sense
because Case has fasting glucose close to the average in GDM participants but Case has fasting glucose equal
to the average in non GDM participants see Table In Model and the features that contribute the most
to the opposite outcome of Case and is weight A weight of kg largely increases the predicted GDM risk

Discussion
This is the first machine learning study that specifically targets pregnant women with overweight and obesity for
GDM prediction As opposed to previously published models see Table that predict GDM among all preg
nant women we focused on an at risk group rather than prediction of GDM in a general pregnant population
Targeting a high risk group is more helpful for clinicians as GDM is more diffcult to identify in this cohort and
it would allow GDM screening in an effcient manner in a clinical setting Also this can be particularly helpful
in clinical practice if combined with a mobile health supported lifestyle intervention that has been proven cost
effective in pregnant women with an elevated
Our dataset is highly unbalanced as the non GDM participants outnumber GDM participants greatly This
is also the case in previous works due to the prevalence of GDM Unless properly handled it can lead to a
model that only performs well on the majority non GDM class i e achieves high specificity but low sensitivity
see We applied SMOTE to oversample the minority class in the training data All of our models achieved
similar specificity and sensitivity showing that the class imbalance problem is adequately addressed In addition
we used balanced accuracy instead of accuracy when testing because the former gives a better evaluation of the
model performance in a class imbalance setting On the contrary accuracy is likely to overestimate the overall
performance of a model when it only performs well on the majority class
An advantage of the study is that we carefully took the clinical usability into account in the modeling process
Three models were developed Model which included all features available including fasting blood biomarkers
to assess GDM risk in a theoretical way Model which excluded fasting blood biomarkers for GDM prediction
in a clinical routine and Model including self reportable features only for remote use In contrast to our work
most models in the literature included data from clinical tests that are not routinely performed in an Irish clinical
setting see Table including fasting blood test as well as other tests that are not available in our dataset such
as coagulation function test and gene testing The inclusion of these data may lead to an increase in the model
performance but at the cost of usability because it makes the models diffcult to translate into clinical use Our
Model performs well achieving AUC ROC of O This is slightly lower than some published models which
included fasting blood tests because we included fewer blood tests and have focused on a high risk group of
women with overweight and obesity among whom GDM prediction is more diffcult compared to a general
pregnant population Our Model and although they gave lower performance than Model have greater
potential in a clinical setting as the features they use are easier to access clinically Compared with previous
works our Model included only one feature from routine blood tests whereas published models included
at least two blood test related features Our Model is the first model that does not include any blood test To
the best of our knowledge there is no other published model that is directly comparable to ours Our models
provide a novel benchmark for future researchers in GDM prediction We recognise that the performance of
our models may require further improvement for use in a clinical setting for example by using some intelligent
optimization algorithms

To further improve clinical usability we used feature selection to keep the amount of data entry on the CDSS
to a minimum so that our CDSS would not be time consuming for clinicians who have heavy workload to fit
into their workflow Our models included a very small set of features or compared with published models
which means our models would be easier and faster to use Moreover our feature selection process was
conducted in collaboration with clinical experts In our dataset education level is higher in GDM participants
than non GDM participants and we trained models on such data which also reflected that a higher education
increased the risk of GDM In literature conflict evidence was reported on the association of education and
GDM In order to avoid confusion and for our models to translate into clinical practice education was removed
in consultant with clinical experts
This is also the first machine learning study to investigate the potential ethnic cultural difference in GDM pre

impact of culture ethnicity on GDM prediction and their models may not be applicable to other populations
Our data was collected in a single centre in Dublin Ireland The majority of the participants are white
but black Chinese other Asian and mixed ethnic women are also included For the purpose of a novel inves
tigation of the cross cultural ethnic difference in GDM prediction in women with overweight and obesity we
trained models on a white population and tested them on non white women Our results show that AUC PR
and AUC ROC are similar between both groups however the decision threshold of leads to lower sensitiv
ity and higher specificity in non white women than white women It shows that a lower decision threshold is
required for a non white population as opposed to a white population in GDM prediction This is consistent
with medical literature which specifies that GDM is more prevalent in non white women than white women
We considered the explainability important in a CDSS Despite an open debate in literature on whether or not
XAI is necessary or worth the substantial cost the use of XAI has been reported to make CDSSs more acceptable
and trustworthy to users and it may translate into a greater use of In our research SHAP was applied
to explain overall behavior of our models as well as the specific prediction made for an instance Our case study
showed that SHAP generated reasonable explanations for our models In addition the effect of features on GDM
risk shown in the case study is consistent with medical knowledge We found out that a high baseline fasting
glucose increased the risk of GDM This is inline with medical literature which suggests median fasting glucose
is higher in GDM participants than others We also showed that a high maternal weight increased the risk of
GDM consistent with the increased risk of GDM with overweight and obesity indicated in literature Therefore
we anticipate that the explanations would help clinical users to gain insights into the model behavior and increase
the acceptability and trustworthiness of our CDSS and thus enhance the potential for use in a clinical setting
It also fills in the gap of the overall lack of XAI use in CDSSs
To protect data privacy mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR in EU and the Health
Research Regulations HRR in Ireland we avoided the use of instance based learning algorithms such as
k Nearest Neighbours kNN KNN models are lazy learners and they involve saving the original training set
for computation when new data come in They are suboptimal for a CDSS because they may lead to personal
data breaches
Our work has been implemented into a web server that is currently available for academic use It resolves
the problem of the lack of an open access model or system for academic benchmarking Further research is
required before adoption into clinical practice Also further cross cultural ethnic testing preferably on a much
larger sample size is needed to investigate the optimal decision threshold for different minority cultural or
ethnic groups In addition future work will be conducted to validate our prototype CDSS in a clinical setting
Conclusion
We developed an explainable machine learning based CDSS for the prediction of GDM in women with over
weight and obesity to identify high risk women for targeted intervention early in pregnancy The CDSS includes
multiple models for theoretical routine antenatal and remote settings to enhance clinical usability It also provides

explanations for both the structure of the models and each specific prediction to gain trust from clinicians A
web based prototype of the CDSS is implemented and publicly available for academic use We also investigated
the cross cultural ethnic difference in GDM prediction which implies that a non white population requires a
lower decision threshold than a white population Further research is required to validate the CDSS in a clinical
setting

Abstract
Introduction High risk pregnancy refers to pregnancy with an increased risk of adverse outcome in mother or the baby Scoring
the risk will identify mothers at risk earlier so that proper resource allocation planned management or timely referral to higher
centers is facilitated and thereby perinatal mortality or morbidity can be reduced
Methods pregnant women with term gestation admitted to labour room were evaluated The risk factors in each case were
assessed and their individual risk scores were determined using a simple scoring system Subsequently their perinatal outcomes
were compared to their respective risk scores
Results It was found that there was a significant association between poor perinatal outcome and high risk pregnancies predicted
by this scoring schedule of the cases belonged to high risk group out of which cases had maternal complications
Significant association between high risk score and perinatal mortality and birth asphyxia was found
Conclusions There was a significant correlation between high risk and poor perinatal outcome So a simple scoring system such
as the one used in our study can be adopted at primary and rural health centers as a screening tool to predict pregnancies at high
risk for poor perinatal outcome Thereby facilitating early referral of these women to tertiary care centres
Keywords High risk pregnancy Risk score Perinatal mortality Birth asphyxia Low birth weight
Introduction
A relatively small percentage of high risk obstetric
population gives rise to a disproportionately high
percentage of perinatal and maternal morbidity and
mortality Scoring the risk factors will be of immense
help to detect high risk pregnancies earlier and to
optimize their management l In our study we use a
simple and easily applicable risk scoring system for
detection of high risk pregnancy and to find the
correlation between the various degrees of risk and
perinatal outcome Such a scoring schedule will
facilitate early detection proper resource allocation
planned management and timely referral of high risk
antenatal women and thereby reduces perinatal
morbidity and mortality
Methods
Study Design Prospective analytical study
Study Period January June
Study Setting Department of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences
Narketpally
Pregnant women with term gestation reporting
to the labour room at our institute during the study
period between January to june were
recruited regardless of their booked unbooked status
age parity socioeconomic status associated diseases
or complications etc Careful history was elicited
followed by thorough general systemic obstetric
examination and relevant investigations to determine
the risk factors in each case
The observations were recorded in prenatal scoring
form based on scoring system suggested by Dutta and
Das and individual risk scores were calculated Table
Based on their total scores the cases were divided
into low moderate and high risk
groups
Subsequently the outcome for the mother in terms
of Mode of delivery and Complications like
postpartum haemorrhage perineal tears wound
infections sepsis and mortality were studied
The perinatal outcome variables studied for the
babies were Birth weight low birth weight defined
as gms including both pre term and SGA
APGAR score at one and five minutes Birth
asphyxia diagnosed by Apgar at one and five
minutes after birth and acidemia umbilical artery Ph
and Perinatal mortality intrauterine deaths still
births and early neonatal deaths upto seven days of
life
These observations were compared with the
respective risk scores of the mothers For statistical
evaluation Chi square test for the analysis of
significance was used
Results
The antenatal women who have been recruited in
the study were classified as low risk moderate
risk
and high risk based on the
cumulative total of their respective scores Out of the
total cases studied were graded as low risk
as moderate risk and belonged to high
risk
of the low risk women and of the
moderate risk group women were unbooked The
prevalence of unbooked cases among high risk women
was as high as The need for operative intervention
increased with increasing risk score of the mother It

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective The systematic review explores personal experiences and perceptions of and on resident Indian
women on family planning
Methods We included qualitative studies conducted among women husbands and mothers in law Search on five
databases published between and May and forward and backward citations search of included
studies were undertaken April Three stage screening and data extraction were done independently
Iterative process was followed to thematically analyse the data and presented it using the World Health Orga
nization conceptual framework on social determinants of health
Result Of citations we included qualitative studies Women s intent of using family planning services
methods was influenced by multiple factors such as socio demographic characteristics Women s agency and
social status affected their standing in family planning decision making Fear of side effects of contraception
