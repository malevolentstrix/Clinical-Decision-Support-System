mortality are not entirely clear Changes in the pre conception health
of pregnant women trends of delaying childbearing increased rates
of cesarean deliveries
as well as racial and ethnic disparities
have been suggested as major contributors Improvements in the
level of surveillance and identification of pregnancy related morbid

E Bomstein et al EClinicalMedicine
Prior studies have documented increasing rates of hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy chronic hypertension diabetes melli
tus very advanced maternal age and grand multiparity among
pregnant women in the United States US These studies were
typically limited by either the size of the sampled population or
the length of the time period examined as well as by the statis
tical method used to evaluate temporal trends We searched
PubMed for any article published up to March referring
to the prevalence and trends in hypertensive disorders of preg
nancy pregnancy induced hypertension gestational hyper
tension preeclampsia eclampsia chronic hypertension
diabetes mellitus pre gestational diabetes gestational diabe
tes advanced maternal age maternal age grand multiparity
and parity
Added value of this study
We document a marked increase in the prevalence of several
maternal risk factors complications hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy chronic hypertension diabetes mellitus very
advanced maternal age and grand multiparity among the
entire population of US pregnant women over the last years
to The added value of this study stems from evalu
ating these trends on the entire population of US pregnant
women and over such an extended period of time In addition
by conducting joinpoint regression analyses we are able to
illustrate the temporal changes of the trends in each of these
risk factors complications throughout our year study period
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results point to a significant and continuous deterioration
in the health of US pregnant women over the past three deca
des which has been especially prominent during the last
decade Understanding the trends in maternal risk factors com
plications could help identify the potential root causes for the
increasing rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the US
as well as target intervention measures to curtail these trends
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy HDP chronic hypertension
CH diabetes mellitus DM very advanced maternal age vAMA
and grand multiparity GM among US gravidas during the three
decade period between and Understanding the long term
trends in these risk factors complications can potentially help clarify
the underlying reasons for the increasing rates of maternal morbidity
and mortality in the US during this time period
Methods
Data and risk factor definitions
This is a retrospective cohort study for the year period from
to Data regarding the annual cases of live births compli
cated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy chronic hypertension
diabetes mellitus very advanced maternal age and grand multipar
ity as well as the total number of live births per year were collected
from the National Center for Health Statistics natality files The data
for were accessed through the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention s CDC Wonder system The data for
were collected from the National Vital Statistics Reports
For
parity the Wonder system only included data since
and
data for all prior years were collected from the National Vital Statis
tics Reports The data include all live births occurring to US resi
dents within the United States
Data on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy HDP defined as
gestational hypertension mild and severe preeclampsia eclampsia
and HELLP syndrome chronic hypertension CH and diabetes mel
litus DM includes pre gestational type I diabetes pre gestational
type II diabetes and gestational diabetes are available in the natality
files since following the implementation of the revision of
the US Standard Certificate of Live Birth These data remain compara
ble throughout the year period until Very advanced mater
nal age vAMA was identified from data on the age group of the
mother and defined as women who were years or older at the
time of delivery Grand multiparity GM was identified from detailed
parity data and defined as women with at least five live births For
each risk factor complication incomplete records were excluded
Statistical analyses
For every year between and we calculated the annual
prevalence of HDP CH DM vAMA and GM as percentages of live
births Subsequently we evaluated the temporal trends in each preg
nancy risk factor complication by way of joinpoint regression analy
sis conducted using the Joinpoint Regression Program Version
by the National Cancer Institute The joinpoint regression
method is used to detect changes in data trends In our application it
was set to fit a model of connected straight lines to a logarithmic
transformation of the data For each potential number of joinpoints
i e points in which the trend changes between O and the loca
tions of the joinpoints were determined via the grid method by cre
ating a grid of all possible joinpoint locations fitting a model to each
possibility and choosing the model with the lowest sum of squared
errors SSE Then the best model with the optimal number of
joinpoints was chosen by comparing the models with the different
number of joinpoints and testing whether more joinpoints were sta
tistically significant Statistical significance was tested via the permu
tation method by running Monte Carlo simulations The
reported results of the model include the locations of the joinpoints
the annual percentage change APC for each segment of the trend
equal to the year over year change in the rate under the assump
tion that this change is constant for the segment and the average
annual percentage change AAPC for the full time period equal to a
weighted average of all of the APCs In addition as an alternative
method Pearson chi square testing was used to compare the preva
lence of each risk factor complication in to its prevalence in
with results presented as relative risks RR This analysis was
conducted using SAS Version In subsequent analyses we calcu
lated the proportion of pregnancies in each of six maternal age
groups under years years years years
years and at or above years of age as well as the preva
lence of HDP CH and DM among these age groups for every year
between and For every age group the temporal trends of
HDP CH and DM were then evaluated by way of the joinpoint
regression method as well as by calculating relative risks
For all tests statistical significance was determined as a p value
below and results were reported with associated confi
dence intervals CI

Discussion
Our study documents dramatic increases in the prevalence of sev
eral pregnancy risk factors complications HDP CH DM vAMA and
GM among US pregnant women during the last three decades For
CH and DM these increases have primarily occurred since the late
early and for HDP and GM they were more pronounced
since the mid late Although the trends in HDP CH and DM
were observed in all age groups vAMA women consistently had
higher rates of these risk factors complications compared to women
in younger age groups This is especially disturbing as the proportion
of pregnancies to vAMA women has also grown during this time
period
Our findings are consistent with several smaller studies that
reported increases in the rates of HDP CH DM vAMA and GM
among different samples of pregnant women in the US and during

Fig Trends in the Prevalence ofDM
by Age Group in Years The figure presents the annual proportions of live births attributed to US women with diabetes mellitus
DM in six age groups under years years years years years and at or above years of age
different time periods over the past three decades For example
Kuklina et al used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project which includes data from
of all nonfederal community hospitals in participating states
and found that the overall prevalence of all hypertensive disorders
among delivery hospitalizations including both HDP and CH
increased from in to in Using the same
database Bateman et al focused specifically on CH and
reported that the age adjusted prevalence of CH increased from
in to in With regard to DM
Lawrence et al focused on a sample of women in Southern
California during the period between and and docu
mented increases in the prevalence of pre existing diabetes from
to and gestational diabetes from to

results not only confirm these prior findings but also illustrate the
magnitude of the increases in the prevalence of these risk factors

complications among the entire US pregnant population Our results
further show that the increase in the prevalence of all risk factors
complications continued through In the last three years alone
we find a prevalence increase of for HDP
for CH for DM for vAMA and for GM Moreover by
using one consistent and comparable dataset with years of rele
vant data we are able to document the long term increasing tempo
ral trends in HDP CH DM vAMA and GM between and
as well as to illustrate the changes in these trends throughout the
years
The prevalence of HDP increased significantly from in
to in AAPC of and RR of After stabilizing in the
late early the prevalence of HDP has increased dramati
cally over the most recent decade in all age groups Figs
and
and
Table This is concerning as HDP is still a major cause of
maternal mortality responsible for approximately of the preg
nancy related deaths that occurred between and
as well as a major contributor to various severe maternal morbidities
The reasons for the increasing trend in the prevalence of HDP are
not well understood but prior research has suggested increasing
rates of co morbidities such as obesity chronic hypertension CH
diabetes mellitus DM advanced maternal age AMA and multiple
gestations as potential explanations
l However while we find
that HDP is indeed more prevalent among vAMA women Fig
the
long term trend that we document in HDP behaves quite differently
from the trends of CH DM and vAMA Figs and Table Simi
larly it does not correspond to the well documented long term con
tinuous increase in obesity rates among pregnant women
Therefore while all of these suggested reasons may contribute to the
increased prevalence of HDP our results suggest that there may be
additional contributing factors Further research is needed to explore
these potential factors
The prevalence of CH rose dramatically since with an espe
cially high APC during the last couple of years Nowadays CH which
affected only of pregnant women in the has
become significantly more common with a prevalence of in
and Table Potential factors that may have contrib
Figs
uted to this increase include increasing rates of obesity and AMA
and indeed we find that the prevalence of CH among women
with vAMA was more than double the overall prevalence Nonethe
less higher relative increases in the rates of CH i e higher AAPCs and
RRs among younger women during the past years have made CH
a noteworthy risk factor even among young women
Fig
Similarly the prevalence of DM has more than doubled since the
early growing continuously at disturbing rates Figs and
Table Poor dietary habits physical inactivity as well as increasing
rates of obesity and AMA have been reported as potential contribu
tors to this increase General improvements in mater
nal screening and detection processes as well as changes in
diagnostic criteria and reporting practices may have also played a
role
Part of the increase that we document can also be
attributed to the revision of the US Standard Certificate of Live
Birth which was adopted in a staggered fashion across states until
and has been found to increase the reported rates of DM
l In any case in DM affected of pregnant women
DM among pregnant women is a known contributor to maternal
morbidity and mortality In fact Nelson et al found
that of the increase in maternal mortality rates in the US
between and was attributed to the increase in the preva
lence of DM
Of specific concern is that during the most recent
decade the prevalence of DM has grown among vAMA women at an
especially high AAPC so that an astounding of vAMA women
in were affected by DM Fig
The prevalence of vAMA increased significantly over the last three
decades and primarily in the Figs and Table
In fact
over the last three decades the proportion of pregnancies attribut
able to women in all of the age groups at or above the age of
increased but the most notable increase was for vAMA women
whose proportion of pregnancies grew threefold from in
This increase can be explained by the
to in Fig
significant advancement in reproductive therapies during the
and by the continuous trend of delaying family planning which can
potentially be attributed to improved access to education and contra
ception as well as to an increased focus on the career development
of women
Prior research has found that women at or above
the age of have higher rates of various pregnancy risk factors and
complications as well as an increased risk of maternal mortality
Our findings confirm these results Specifically we find
that older women with vAMA consistently had a higher prevalence
of HDP throughout the years Fig and that the prevalence of both
CH and DM consistently increased with age peaking in the vAMA age
group Figs Nonetheless our study documents significant
increases in the prevalence of HDP CH and DM across all age groups
and further solidifies their position as major risk factors complica
tions among all pregnant women in the US
The overall increase in the prevalence of GM was relatively mod
erate during the past three decades but practically all of this increase
has occurred since In of live births were attributed
to grand multiparous women Figs

Background Despite the enormous advantages of early pregnancy related problem diagnosis and therapy during prenatal care
Visits not all pregnant women begin antenatal care at the proper time Thus this study aims to identify factors associated with
missed opportunities for antenatal care service utilization among reproductive age women in Eastern Ethiopia Methods A
mixed methods study design quantitative and qualitative was conducted in Grawa Meta and Haramaya woredas from
September to December The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version A multivariable logistic
regression analysis model was used to identify the predictors Statistical software programs based on ATLAS ti version was
were used to conduct the thematic analysis of the qualitative data Results Overall missed opportunities for antenatal care
were of Factors such as maternal age being AOR CI having a college
education AOR CI elementary AOR CI and secondary education
AOR CI having five and more parity AOR CI three visits AOR
CI those in the first trimester AOR CI and the second trimester AOR
CI and get information from a health facility AOR O CI and traditional birth attendance
AOR CI were factors statistically associated with outcome variables Conclusions According to this
report relatively high proportions of pregnant women experienced missed opportunities in antenatal care follow up Factors
such as maternal age education parity frequency timing and media access were statistically significantly correlated with
missed antenatal care follow up Therefore all stakeholders should emphasize advocating for and enhancing the benefits of
antenatal care this in turn plays a crucial role in increasing the follow up of clients for these crucial services Moreover health
policy implementers need to coordinate their tracking of pregnant women who missed their antenatal care session
Introduction
Globally an estimated million women died from com
plications related to pregnancy childbirth and postpartum
period Every day about pregnant women pass
away from curable or preventable pregnancy related condi
tions Among these ninety nine percent of women
die in developing countries due to pregnancy and childbirth
Even though maternal mortality is a global issue its
major issues are most felt in underdeveloped countries As
a result developing nations account for percent of the esti
mated global number of maternal fatalities with an estimated
of those deaths happening in sub Saharan Africa
Quality antenatal care accessible obstetrics care and
life saving interventions are critical services for reducing
preventable maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity
Bringing the global maternal death rate down to fewer
than per live births is a key component of
Sustainable Development Goal SDG To eliminate
preventable causes of maternal death due to pregnancy
related complications existing interventions during preg
nancy and delivery must be scaled up Hemorrhage hyper
tension and infection are the leading causes of maternal death
The most common causes of newborn deaths and
stillbirths are asphyxia prematurity and infections and the
majority are preventable with existing evidence based inter
ventions either directly or indirectly during pregnancy labor
delivery and postpartum
Despite the fact that universal coverage of antenatal care
services is reported globally and at the country level many
pregnant women in developing countries do not benefit
from comprehensive antenatal care due to factors such as
late initiation and poor quality of antenatal care services
Early initiation during the first trimester and qual
ity antenatal care throughout the pregnancy have been
shown to improve pregnancy outcomes and increase new
born survival However in developing countries only
of pregnant women initiated antenatal care before
weeks of gestation and of pregnant women did not
complete four antenatal care visits
Despite the disparities in maternal death rates across
developed and developing countries studies have demon
strated that the pattern of maternal mortality and morbidity
has remained constant throughout time The reasons given
for this include the long standing custom of having births
at home in risky and unclean settings with untrained or
inadequately qualified delivery attendants
In Ethiopia the maternal death ratio decreased from
new births in to in This
puts Ethiopian women at a much higher risk than their
counterparts in the developed world where the risk was esti
mated to be in and in in nations like
Greece and Poland respectively As a result the likelihood
of an Ethiopian woman dying from reproductive health dis
orders and complications was put at in in in
in and in in
Despite the government s and numerous stakeholders
dedication to advocating for and enhancing the benefits of
antenatal care the prevalence of missed opportunities and
factors influencing them remain unabated Additionally to
researchers knowledge there is a dearth of published mate
rial pertaining to missed opportunities and their related
causes in the study region Furthermore there is no single
study that employed qualitative methods to dig out the var
iable under study As a result this study assessed the preva
lence of missed opportunities and associated factors in the
study area
Methods and Materials
Study Design Setting and Period A mixed methods
study cross sectional quantitative method and phenome

to December among pregnant women
in Grawa Meta and Haramaya woredas This study site
namely Haramaya Meta and Grawa is situated in Eastern
Ethiopia and kilometers from the capital city

were and Of these reproductive
age groups account for a total population of Most
residents make their living through farming and small
scale trading Figure
Population and Eligibility Criteria All woreda dwelling
women of reproductive age who had given birth within the
previous five years of the data gathering were considered
the source population whereas randomly selected women
using the sampling technique who were available during
the data collection period were regarded as the study popu
lation The inclusion criteria were women who were permanent
residents who lived more than one year in the study area in
the selected districts and women whose ages were between
and years Women with hearing impairments or communi
cation impairment conditions as well as those who were criti
cally ill had mental health issues or had been alive for less
than a year at the time of the interview were excluded
Sample Size Determination and Sampling Procedures
The sampling size was computed by using a single popula
tion ratio formula based on the assumption that to get the
largest sample size possible and in light of the lack of prior
prevalence statistics on the population being studied p was
taken to be Additionally a confidence interval
and a margin of error were established Z
women aged between and years made up the
majority of the total population N and a sample
size of women was determined using a contingency
for nonresponse
A three stage sampling approach was used in this investi
gation of the total kebeles in each district were included
in the initial stage As the number of kebeles varies in the three
districts proportional sampling to give equal weights was used
As a result samples were taken from percent of
kebeles in Grawa percent in Meta and percent in
Haramaya Based on the size of the population
kebeles and HHs from Haramaya kebeles and
HHs from Meta and kebeles and HHs from Grawa
were selected for the sample of kebeles and homes HHS A
lottery technique was used to choose the respondents with vil
lages being selected at random Last but not least research
subjects took samples from kebeles in the three woredas a total
of study samples were chosen utilizing a systematic sam
pling technique Then each patient was given a unique code
The sample size determination and sampling procedures

ered the data The principal investigator was supervised by
two public health professionals who are familiar with the
study s environment Three days of training on ethics tools
sampling and data collection techniques was given to data

prompt feedback
Variables and Their Measurement Antenatal care
ANC is the proportion of women aged to who gave
birth alive and got prenatal care four or more times within
a specific time period
Missed opportunities in maternal and infant health
research are built on the premise that considerable chances
for enhancing mother and child health have been missed
or might have been avoided and that a better arrangement
and focus on postpartum care will lower maternal morbidity
and death
A traditional birth attendant TBA is a person who
assists a mother during prenatal and postpartum care and
who initially acquired her skills by delivering babies herself
or through apprenticeship to other traditional birth atten
dants
Data Quality Control A bilingual expert Afaan Oromo
created the questionnaire in English before translating it into
the regional tongues To guarantee uniformity it was then
translated back into an English version The supervisor and
data collectors both got training on the methods and tools for
collecting data of the study participants took a pretest in
a setting similar to research data collection Regular oversight
was given by the investigators and skilled research supervisors
Data Processing and Analysis The acquired information
was initially checked for consistency and completeness
Then for further analysis they were cleaned coded and
put to EpiData version The entered data were trans
ferred to SPSS version for analysis Descriptive and sum
mary data were produced and published using frequency
tables and figures A binary logistic regression model was
created to examine any connections between the indepen
dent variables and the outcome variable The fitness of the
model was assessed by Hosmer Lemeshow statistics and
Omnibus testing A multivariable analysis was used to iden
tify the real factors that affected the result variables To
determine whether there was any relationship between the
independent variables a multicollinearity test was carried
out using the standard error and colinearity statistics There
were no detectable collinearity effects With this in mind the
variance inflation factor V IF was To ascertain the
strength and direction of the statistical association the odds
ratio OR and confidence interval CI were utilized
At a p value it was determined that both the bivariate
and multivariate analyses were statistically significant

transportation from their homes to the nearest health facil
ity while respondents received ANC service
from the health center Three fourths of the respondents
had started their ANC services because of health
problems Nonetheless of the study s partici
pants lack confidence in medical professionals The survey
discovered that respondents had received health
education while getting ANC Regarding privacy more than
respondents stated that their privacy was not
respected during ANC visits Table
Moreover the focus group discussion FGD participants
strengthened the ideas provided above and one a year
old female focus group discussant expressed the diffculty of
maintaining privacy and confidentiality She stated that
the male doctor inserted his fingers into my vagina and
other nurses stood there looking at him Perhaps they were
in training I feel bad seeing that crowd staring at me
Because there were no curtains and no private room it was
diffcult to change my clothes and breastfeed the baby after
birth We can see each other and others visitors can easily
see us After the baby is born one bed for each woman
and private rooms or curtains around the bed to avoid seeing
other women would be more comfortable for all women
In a similar vein one participant in FGD said that
when I went to the hospital for an antenatal check up
there was a health care provider It was not what I had
hoped for before going to the hospital for service There was
no respectful healthcare provider The male doctors were
there to perform examinations The doctors pressed hard on
my tummy causing me pain
Thus from the above discussion we conclude that the
way the healthcare providers treat the woman plays a pivotal
role in keeping her on track with ANC
Furthermore one of the participants immensely com
plained about the waiting time in the ANC and said that
we are busy at home with our daily tasks and when we
go for ANC visits we are expected to stay at least an hour We
have a lot of daily activities that we do during this time As a
result we are clearly tired of waiting which leads us to aban
don follow up A year old woman
