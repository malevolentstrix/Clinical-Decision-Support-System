Statistical analysis
Of physicians who completed the survey we excluded
whose practice did not provide family planning services to female pa
tients of reproductive age just before the pandemic resulting in an an
alytic sample of physicians
We described physician and clinical practice characteristics of re
spondents We also described practice level family planning related
clinical services provided and strategies used just before and at any
point during the COVID pandemic and practice level service provi
Sion issues experienced because of the COVID pandemic at any point
during the pandemic and in the month before survey completion We
used the McNemar s test of dependent proportions Fagerland et al
to compare estimates by time period i e just before and at any
point during the COVID pandemic for clinical services provided and
strategies used and at any point during the COVID pandemic and in
the month before survey completion for service provision issues expe
rienced We considered findings with a p value as statistically
significant Additionally among physicians who reported their practice
provided the clinical service or used the strategy just before the
pandemic we examined the proportion who reported their practice
discontinued the service or strategy during the pandemic i e did not
provide at any point during the pandemic Similarly among physicians
who reported their practice did not provide the clinical service or did not
use the strategy just before the pandemic we examined the proportion

Discussion
We found many changes in family planning clinical services when
comparing service delivery before and during the pandemic and some
Preventive Medicine
differences by physician type We observed slight decreases in the pro
portion of physicians overall whose practices provided LARC services
reflecting physicians whose practices offered LARC services before but
discontinued these services during the pandemic Approximately one in
five physicians surveyed whose practices provided other key routine
contraception practices just before the pandemic reported practice
level discontinuation of these practices during the pandemic e g
providing or prescribing ECPs in advance and sending patient reminders
about DMPA injections or LARC removal or replacement We observed
increases in the proportion of physicians whose practices used service
delivery approaches that improve access and reduce the need for in
person visits i e telehealth for contraception accepted self report of
blood pressure during telehealth visits for contraception renewed
contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit and curb
side pickup or mail delivery of contraception reflecting physicians
whose practices did not offer these services before but initiated these
services during the pandemic The physicians surveyed also experienced
practice level service provision issues during the pandemic e g fewer
adult females seeking care clinic closed for in person appointments
While a smaller proportion of physicians reported these issues in the
month before survey completion compared with at any point during the
pandemic about one third still reported fewer adult females seeking
care
We observed low availability of LARC services both before and
during the pandemic A core component of quality family planning
services is patient access to a broad range of contraceptive methods
including LARC Gavin et al As part of providing patient
centered care and supporting individual reproductive autonomy ac
cess to in person visits for LARC placement and removal services is
needed if LARC services are desired by patients Access to LARC
methods which are highly effective Trussell et al and have few
medical contraindications for use Curtis et al
might be
particularly important during the pandemic given possible changes in
attitudes toward contraception One study found that one in four women
overall and one in two women with concerns about reduced access to
contraception reported thinking more about getting a LARC method
because of the pandemic Lindberg et al
Only one in three physicians surveyed reported their practices pro
vided or prescribed ECPs in advance both before and during the
pandemic despite evidence based guidance supporting advance pro
vision of ECPs so they can be taken as soon as possible after unprotected
sexual intercourse Curtis et al This finding may be because
levonorgestrel ECPs are available over the counter in the United States
and physicians may not perceive that they have an important role
ensuring patient access to emergency contraception However despite
over the counter access barriers to ECPs remain including stocking
issues and confusion about access requirements
Upadhya
Emergency contraception is an important backup contraceptive option
and might have increased salience during the COVID pandemic
because of potential pandemic related contraception access barriers
A promising finding from our analysis is use of telehealth for
contraception care in line with recommendations to offer telehealth
services during the pandemic Centers for Disease Control and Preven
Our analysis found that more than half of physicians
tion CDC
surveyed reported providing telehealth for both contraception initiation
and continuation at some point during the pandemic reflecting signif
icant increases compared with just before the pandemic These findings
are similar to prior surveys of family planning providers that found
increased provision of telehealth services for contraception during the
COVID pandemic Stifani et al Weigel et al
Never
theless recent medical claims data have shown that while telehealth
services have grown rapidly during the pandemic these services were
not sufficient to offset drops in in person visits Cox and Amin
Moreover providers have reported challenges with telehealth including
technical difficulties inability to conduct physical exams and diagnostic
testing and lack of guidance on telehealth best practices Stifani et al
L B Zapata et al
Weigel et al
In our survey although physicians reported
fewer practice level telehealth issues in the month before survey
completion compared with at any point during the pandemic suggesting
gained experience implementing telehealth over time nearly one in
three continued to report technical challenges with telehealth and
approximately one in five continued to report confidentiality concerns
billing challenges and patient discomfort with telehealth Confidenti
ality concerns with telehealth remained a particular issue for pediatri
cians Resources are available to support family planning service
delivery through telehealth including information on providing person
centered care workflow best practices billing and online pharmacies

Low use of these strategies highlights opportunities for service delivery

certain strategies
Limitations
Our findings are subject to several limitations Respondents were
sampled from a volunteer panel of medical professionals and sampling
was not random or population based As such findings are not gener
alizable to the U S population of primary care physicians pediatricians
and obstetrician gynecologists and statistical inferences should be
interpreted with caution No information was collected about non
respondents so we are unable to determine how respondents and non
respondents differed with respect to family planning service provision
Data are based on physician self report of practice level experiences and
some responses may be inaccurate due to recall social desirability or
other types of reporting error We assessed clinical practices used at any
point during the COVID pandemic rather than routine provision or
provision at different time points during the pandemic e g early versus
later months as such findings may overestimate initiation and un
derestimate discontinuation of practices during the pandemic Also
related to discontinuation of practices we do not know if discontinua
tion occurred because of the physician regardless of patient demand or
because of a lack of patients seeking services Assessment of service
provision issues experienced was related to providing family planning or
STI services so we do not know with certainty that issues reported were
specific to family planning service delivery We focused on contracep
tion services in this analysis but acknowledge that family planning
services include a wider range of services such as pregnancy testing and
counseling basic infertility services and STI screening and treatment
Gavin et al Last we only assessed experiences of physicians
Preventive Medicine
who reported providing family planning services to female patients of
reproductive age and recognize that physicians may also provide these
services to individuals not identifying as female
Conclusions
Discontinuation of key family planning services during the COVID
pandemic may limit contraception access which may impede
reproductive autonomy and contribute to unintended pregnancies
Implementing healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the
need for in person visits e g telehealth for contraception initiation and
continuation curbside pickup or mail delivery of contraception
providing or prescribing ECPs in advance providing or prescribing a
year s worth of contraception may decrease disruptions in care Re
sources exist for public health and clinical efforts to ensure contracep
tion access during the pandemic

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective Pregnancy among systemic lupus erythematosus SLE affected women is highly associated
with poor obstetric outcomes Predicting the risk of foetal outcome is essential for maximizing the success
of pregnancy This study aimed to develop a clinical decision support system CDSS to predict pregnancy
outcomes among SLE affected pregnant women
Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of pregnant women with SLE who were followed
at Shariati Hospital pregnancies and a specialized clinic pregnancies from to We
selected significant features p O IO using a binary logistic regression model performed in IBM SPSS
version Afterward we trained several artificial neural networks multi layer perceptron MLP and
radial basis function RBFI to predict the pregnancy outcome In order to evaluate and select the most
effective network we used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve
We finally developed a CDSS based on the most accurate network MATLAB software was applied
to design the neural networks and develop the CDSS
Results Initially potential variables were analysed by the binary logistic regression and effective
features were selected as the inputs of neural networks P value The accuracy sensitivity
and specificity of the test data for the MLP network were achieved These measures for
the RBF network were and respectively Having applied a fold cross validation
method the accuracy for the networks showed accuracy for RBF and accuracy for MLP
Therefore the MLP network was selected as the most accurate network for prediction of pregnancy
outcome
Conclusion The developed CDSS based on the MLP network can help physicians to predict pregnancy
outcomes in women with SLE
Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE is a chronic autoimmune
disease with a worldwide distribution SLE as an inflammatory
multi system disease with unknown aetiology has different clini

According to studies the prevalence of SLE varies

worldwide A meta analysis of studies carried out in North
America and Europe indicated that the prevalence of SLE is per
In Iran SLE is relatively common with a prevalence of
per The overall prevalence of SLE in women is much
more than in men and is mostly common in the reproductive age
Pregnancy in SLE affected women is a major challenge Young
women with SLE who want to become pregnant encounter a num
ber of risks to their and their unborn baby s health
Pregnancies
in SLE affected women may lead to foetal loss in the form of a
spontaneous abortion before weeks of gestation or intrauter
ine foetal death still birth after weeks of gestation Foetal
K Paydar et al International Journal of Medical Informatics
loss has decreased significantly from in the to in
the early in SLE affected women
Although in recent
years foetal survival has increased due to better understanding
of the causes of abortion in SLE patients and better therapeutic
approaches
foetal loss continues to be higher among SLE
affected women than the normal population Overall about
of pregnancies in SLE affected women end up in foetal loss
A study conducted in shows a pregnancy loss rate of
in organ threatening SLE affected women compared with healthy
women where the pregnancy loss rate is Generally the
incidence of spontaneous abortion is approximately among
SLE affected women while it is in the normal population
Special gynaecological and rheumatological care is necessary to
increase the chance of pregnancy success Regarding the impor
tance of pregnancy outcomes pregnancy in SLE patients should
be planned in advance and the patients should be monitored
before and during the pregnancy However decision making
and prediction of pregnancy outcomes in SLE patients is a complex
task for physicians A variety of factors with different degrees of
effectiveness may affect the outcome of pregnancy in SLE affected
women In addition non linear relationships between these fac
tors and the outcome of pregnancy may result in more complexities
Clinical decision support systems CDSS are considered to be
useful tools for solving sophisticated problems A CDSS is designed
to help healthcare providers make timely decisions about their
patients These systems can be developed based on the experts
knowledge historical data analysis or clinical evidence
In this regard a variety of algorithms such as neural networks
fuzzy logic regression Bayesian networks or a combination of
these algorithms have been successfully applied in different fields
of clinical practices
Prediction of pregnancy outcomes for SLE patients can notice
ably contribute towards providing effective health consulting
and therapeutic services as well as prevent undesirable out
comes and physical and psychological complications resulting
from an abortion
Considering the importance of influ
ential factors on the outcome of pregnancy risk factors many
studies have been conducted worldwide to identify these fac
tors For example factors such as high blood pressure lupus
nephritis thrombosis anti phospholipid antibodies flare up of
lupus during six months before pregnancy anti cardiolipin anti
bodies lupus anti coagulant anaemia leucopoenia age at time
of conception history of abortion the number of children and
many other factors have been introduced in previous studies
The numerous risk factors and the com
plexity of relationships among these risk factors necessitate the
development of a CDSS Application of CDSS in maternal care in
developing countries has been previously reported
how
ever to the best of our knowledge no CDSS has been developed
to support physicians in predicting the outcome of pregnancy in
SLE affected women Therefore in this study we developed and
evaluated a CDSS based on an artificial neural network ANN appli
cation
Material and methods
Data source and data collection
In order to identify the potential variables we first conducted
a literature review and an interview with a rheumatologist We
used this search strategy to find related literature systemic lupus
erythematosus OR SLE AND predictor OR risk factor AND preg
nancy outcome OR foetal loss in PubMed Scopus and Google
Scholar We selected related articles published in English from
In addition we considered local evidence and rheumatol
ogist consultations We identified potential variables in this
regard however five of these variables anti Ro ss A and anti
La ss B antibodies anti glycoprotein I antibody anti
serum albumin level and antihypertensive use were mostly not
recorded in the patients records Therefore we collected data for
the other variables The needed data was retrospectively col
lected from the medical records of SLE affected pregnant women
who had visited a specialized hospital Shariati Hospital and a spe
cialized clinic in Tehran Iran from to We also used the
database of these cases in the Rheumatology Research Center to
collect some required data elements that were not available in the
medical records A trained researcher the first author extracted
the data from the medical records and the database
Out of registered pregnancies the medical records of only
of these pregnancies were available and eligible for analysis
from the hospital and from the specialized clinic The final
dataset included the possible influential factors and pregnancy
outcomes of the cases
Pre processing and feature selection
The outcome of pregnancy had four categories first trimester
spontaneous abortion second trimester spontaneous abortion
and preterm and term live birth We re classified these categories
into two classes spontaneous abortion and live birth
There was data missing for some variables One of the
approaches for resolving such a problem is using the mean or
mode of the variable for all samples belonging to the same class
This approach has been applied in previous studies
There
fore we also replaced missing values by the mean of each class for
numeric values and the mode of each class for non numeric values
Multiplicity ofthe variables features may result in overtraining
a model Therefore one of the most commonly used pre processing
techniques is dimension reduction or feature selection In this
regard irrelevant weakly relevant or less important features are
removed
Feature selection may improve the accuracy of the
resulting model Researchers have applied a variety of techniques
for this purpose
For this end we used the binary logistic
regression method through IBM SPSS software version Sixteen
important features P value O IO were finally selected as inputs
to train the neural networks
Designing neural networks
We selected ANNs as our training algorithms because these net
works have been successfully applied to develop a CDSS for many
situations in healthcare
and ANNs usually perform better than
statistical methods
We used the selected features from the previous step as the
inputs of the ANN Inputs were normalized before being entered in
networks by using the min max method We developed two differ
ent models of ANN including a feedforward multilayer perceptron
MLP network with a scaled conjugate gradient trainscg back
propagation learning algorithm and a radial basis function RBF
network with a Levenberg Marquardt trainlm back propagation
learning algorithm using MATLAB software The learning
algorithm for MLP and RBF neural networks can be mentioned using
the generalized delta rule and gradient descent because they have
nonlinear activation functions Using a back propagation algorithm
in the procedure of learning requires the change in weight made by
the gradient descent rule
During the procedure of learning
in neural networks an epoch is accomplished when all the training
examples are presented to the network and are processed using the
learning algorithm only once

Rate of h protein in the urine before pregnancy
Rate of h protein in the urine in the first trimester of pregnancy
Flare up of lupus during six months before pregnancy
Blood pressure greater than or equal to mmhg before pregnancy or in the first
trimester
is a component of the complement system The complement system is a set of
types of proteins in serum and the cells and a component of the immune system
Reduction of complement represents activity of SLE
These two variables
indicate the rate of before and during in the first trimester of pregnancy
The complement system is a set of types of protein in serum and the cells and a
component of the innate innate and acquired adaptive immune system
Reduction of complements represents this disease activity
The anti phospholipid antibody syndrome APS is persistent presence of an
anti phospholipid antibody in patients that have recurrent thrombosis or pregnancy
losses
Production of anti cardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant
positivity are seen in patients with APS
Antibodies that act against IgG Secretion of this antibody is associated with APS
syndrome
Antibodies that act against IgM Secretion of this antibody is associated with APS
syndrome
An antibody that acts by interfering with the binding of phospholipid to form
prothrombin activator in lupus patients
Previous history of abortion
Diabetes in the first trimester of pregnancy
Number of blood platelets before pregnancy
Number of blood platelets in the first trimester of pregnancy
It includes pleuritis lupus pneumonitis and infectious pneumonia
It includes pericarditis myocarditis and valvular lesion
It includes convulsions psychosis peripheral neuropathy and central involvement
VDRL is a screening test for syphilis
RF is an auto antibody that acts directly against antigens
C reactive protein CRP is secreted in response to tissue damage and inflammation
It is a measuring test for the destruction of liver cells
It is a measuring test for the destruction of liver cells
Alkaline phosphate ALP is a hepatic enzyme Increase of ALP could be mainly due to
liver disease
Auto antibodies that are active against the cell nucleus

anti cardiolipin aCL antibodies are not directed against phospholipids but target
intravascular cationic proteins either alone or in complexes with anionic
phospholipids
Albumin is a protein made by the liver Serum albumin level is measured by the test
of the amount of this protein in the clear liquid portion of the blood
Antihypertensive drugs are mainly taken to prevent and treat severe hypertension
Spontaneous abortion spontaneous termination of pregnancy before the
week of pregnancy
Live birth term and pre term live birth
P value
c We could not access to data about these five variables and we had to remove them from our analysis
Machine learning algorithms have different parameters that
need to be set researchers usually set different parameters and
develop and compare several models in different attempts to reach
the best solution based on their dataset
We considered
one hidden layer and determined the number of neurons in the hid
den layer incrementally This approach has been applied in previous
