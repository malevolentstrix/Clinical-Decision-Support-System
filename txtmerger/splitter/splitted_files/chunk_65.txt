hat everybody has to wear a mask
and wash their hands and nobody can come over
and nobody can help you take care of that baby
there are a lot of really terrible practical implications
of this virus for pregnant women in new families
They also hoped that with the rapid development of
vaccines this might help them get a general idea as
to whether properly timing a vaccine during preg
nancy might help confer immunity to the fetus
Puopolo and her colleagues collected blood from
mothers and their baby s umbilical cords and
tested them both for antibodies Eighty three of the
mothers tested positive for COVID antibodies and
of their babies showed antibody levels at least
as high or higher than their mothers What our
work established was that these antibodies are trans
ferred they appear to be transferred with a timing
that is relatively rapid relative to when the woman
gets the disease said Puopolo And furthermore
the data suggest that the earlier a mother is infected
July August
the greater the transfer of
The data suggest
antibodies to the fetus
that the earlier a
though further studies are
mother is infected
needed to determine these
the greater the trans
precise dynamics This
fer of antibodies to
hints that there may very
the fetus
well be an optimal time to
vaccinate the mother Of course this isn t the only
thing an obstetrician has to think about when coun
seling a patient said Puopolo but we now at least
have some information to provide to care providers
about the best time during pregnancy to immunize
This presumes a pregnant mother even can get
immunized Vaccine safety in pregnant women has
been slow to come That s because historically preg
nant women have long been excluded from clinical
trials to protect both mother and child from ill effects
Sadly in the case of the pandemic this left one of
the most vulnerable populations without basic safety
information Fortunately that is all finally beginning to
change Formal clinical studies with pregnant women
for both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are cur
rently underway and preliminary data on more than
people showed no obvious safety issues from
those vaccines in pregnant women It remains
unclear if other vaccines particularly those that are
more widely available outside of the United States
like Covishield from AstraZeneca and Covaxin are
safe for pregnant women leaving many expectant
mothers at risk
Life prevails
If there can be said to be a gift in this pandemic it
is in how relatively less it affects children and that so
far has appeared to extend to infants born over the last
year Though there have been documented cases of
newborns being infected after birth the CDC and the
American Academy of Pediatrics say this is unlikely
Only of newborns test positive for the virus in
the few days after birth and those that do don t get
especially sick Generally all of them are born to moth
ers who are acutely ill and likely weren t sick enough
during pregnancy to pass along immunity
When I think back to how worried we were at the
beginning of the pandemic said Valerie Flaherman
associate professor of Pediatrics and Epidemiology
and Biostatistics at the University of California San
Francisco Medical Center Figure there were
so many things about COVID that were difficult to
understand and we were all really worried the babies

would have a lot of deleterious impacts Flaherman
in a study looking at babies born to infected women
found that in general the babies did well But she
said we have yet to see comprehensive data from
babies born to women infected early in pregnancy
Other viruses like Zika and Rubella are known to
cause severe birth defects and perhaps even cog
nitive behavioral and psychiatric disorders that
may not be obvious until later in life Most of
the time said Puopolo the issues with all of these
viruses occur during a very narrow period early in
pregnancy where there s very rapid organ develop
ment in the baby It s still too early to know if the virus
is capable of similar effects something Flaherman is
currently investigating
THOUGH MUCH HAS been learned in these pandem
ic laden months there are still merely hints and clues
about the effects of COVID on reproductive health
And for some there is no time to waste My experi
ence is when it comes to fertility patients do not want
to wait said Vij Her practice never really slowed
down even at the height of the pandemic

BACKGROUND The relationship between gestational diabetes mel
litus and adverse outcomes in multifetal pregnancies is complex and
controversial Moreover limited research has focused on the risk of
gestational diabetes mellitus progression to type diabetes mellitus
specifically in multifetal pregnancies resulting in conflicting results from
existing studies
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the risk of gestational diabetes
mellitus progression to type diabetes mellitus between singleton and
multifetal pregnancies in a large cohort of parturients with a year
follow up
STUDY DESIGN A retrospective study was conducted on a pro
spective cohort of pregnant individuals with pregnancies between January
and December followed up to years after delivery
Glucose levels during pregnancy were obtained from the Meuhedet Health
Maintenance Organization laboratory system and cross linked with the
Israeli National Diabetes Registry The cohort was divided into groups
singleton pregnancy without gestational diabetes mellitus singleton
pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus multifetal pregnancy without
gestational diabetes mellitus and multifetal pregnancy with gestational
diabetes mellitus Gestational diabetes mellitus was defined according to
the American Diabetes Association criteria using the step strategy
Univariate analyses followed by survival analysis that included Kaplan
Meier hazard curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used
to assess differences between groups and calculate the adjusted hazard
ratios with confidence intervals for progression to type diabetes
mellitus
RESULTS Among parturients cases met the inclusion
criteria The prevalence of type diabetes mellitus was in the
singleton pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group and in
the multifetal pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group Partu
rients with gestational diabetes mellitus regardless of plurality were older
and had higher fasting plasma glucose levels in the first trimester of
pregnancy The rates of increased body mass index hypertension and
earlier gestational age at delivery were significantly higher in the gesta
tional diabetes mellitus group among patients with singleton pregnancies
but not among patients with multifetal pregnancies Survival analysis
demonstrated that gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with
adjusted hazard ratios of type diabetes mellitus of confidence
interval in singleton pregnancies and confidence
interval in multifetal pregnancies P OOI for both
Stratified analysis based on obesity status revealed that in parturients

prevalence of obesity and advanced

nancies is firmly linked to short term
risks such as accelerated fetal growth
and macrosomia and long term risks
such as the potential development of
metabolic syndrome
The incidence of GDM in multifetal
pregnancies is higher than in singleton
pregnancies probably because of
increased placental mass and placental
hormone levels However the associa

outcomes in multifetal pregnancies is
complex and conflicting GDM compli

Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to evaluate the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus GDM
progression to type diabetes mellitus between singleton and multifetal
pregnancies in a large cohort of parturients with a year follow up
Key findings
The prevalence of was in the singleton pregnancy with GDM group
and in the multifetal pregnancy with GDM group GDM doubled the risk of
progression to in singleton pregnancies compared with multifetal preg
nancies adjusted hazard ratio vs P OOI for both Stratified analysis
based on obesity status revealed that in pregnant individuals without obesity
GDM elevated risk by in singleton pregnancies and insignificantly
elevated risk in multifetal pregnancies However in pregnant individuals
with obesity GDM raised risk by in singleton pregnancies and in
multifetal pregnancies
What does this add to what is known
This study unveils the complex effect of GDM in multifetal pregnancies In
pregnant individuals without obesity who carry multifetal pregnancy GDM did
not substantially increase the risk of progression to raising a possible need
to individualize the diagnostic criteria and glucose target levels for GDM in
multifetal pregnancies Conversely the risk was Considerably higher in
pregnant individuals with obesity who carry multifetal pregnancies and develop
GDM than in pregnant individuals with obesity who carry singleton pregnancies
and develop GDM suggesting that this population may require special attention
and follow up after delivery to facilitate early diagnosis of
protective role potentially reducing the
risk of placental insufficiency and fetal
growth restriction in multifetal pregnan
cies This implies that GDM treatment in
multifetal pregnancies may not improve
neonatal outcomes
The pathophysiology of GDM is
thought to involve preclinical prepreg
nancy pancreatic cell dysfunction
which in turn accounted for the
higher risk of developing type diabetes
mellitus after delivery
Therefore pregnant individuals with
GDM are recommended to undergo a
postpartum glucose tolerance test GTT
and subsequent follow up In multifetal
pregnancies the pathophysiology of
GDM is uncertain Although some sug
gest that increased GDM is due to
increased placental mass leading to
higher levels of diabetogenic hormones
such as human placental lactogen and
steroidal hormones others contend
that the diabetogenic effect of hyper
placentosis in multifetal pregnancies is
counterbalanced by greater glucose up
take of the increased fetal mass This
perspective presents GDM as somewhat
physiological in multifetal pregnancies
Moreover data on the risk after
GDM is conflicting with only a few
studies comparing the progression
of GDM to in singleton vs mul
tifetal pregnancies yielding opposing
results
If the risk of progression to
is similar to that of singleton
pregnancies this supports the idea that
GDM even in multifetal pregnancies is
pathologic
Thus this study aimed to evaluate the
risk of GDM progression to be
tween singleton and multifetal preg
nancies in a large cohort of parturients
with a year follow up

Comment
Principal findings of the study
Here we aimed to compare the risk of
GDM progression to between
singleton and multifetal pregnancies
Our main findings were as follows
l Compared with GDM in singleton
pregnancies GDM in multifetal
pregnancies doubles the overall risk
of developing within years
In parturients without obesity GDM
in singleton pregnancies increases the
risk of developing in years
by whereas in multifetal preg
nancies GDM does not elevate this
risk significantly
For parturients with obesity we
observed that GDM in multifetal
pregnancies resulted in a times
higher risk of developing than
GDM in singleton pregnancies
Results in the context of other
studies
Few studies have evaluated the associa
tion between GDM and adverse out
comes in multifetal pregnancies yielding
conflicting
results
More specifically to the best of our
knowledge the progression of GDM to
in multifetal pregnancies was
addressed in only studies
Hiersch
et al evaluated g OGTT results for
singleton and twin pregnancies and
showed that the incidence of was
lower for pregnant individuals with a
twin pregnancy for any given OGTT
value indirectly suggesting that GDM in
twins was less associated with
Similarly using a large Canadian data
base Retnakaran et demonstrated
that the risk of GDM progression to
was lower in pregnant individuals
with twin pregnancies than in those with
singleton pregnancies Conversely Cai
mari et al demonstrated similar rates of
GDM progression to impaired glucose
ajog org
tolerance or between singleton
and multifetal pregnancies The dis
crepancies between our study results and
those of Hiersch and Retnakaran could
be attributed to several factors First
both Hiersch and Retnakaran employed
a g OGTT Previous research has
indicated that the use of a g OGTT
leads to a fold increase in the diagnosis
of GDM while maintaining a similar rate
of adverse outcomes This may lead to
overdiagnosis of GDM in their cohorts
which could potentially have a substan
tial effect on the study results Caimari
et used g OGTT but with the
National Diabetes Data Group criteria
Second we conducted separate analyses
for singleton and multifetal pregnancies
employing a multivariate approach that
adjusted for potential confounders Un
like the studies by Hiersch and Retna
karan our cohort was stratified for
maternal BMI which differed from
previous studies a factor we found to
have a substantial role in the progression
of GDM to in multifetal preg
nancies This distinction is noteworthy
particularly when considering that in the
study by Caimari et al where the me
dian BMI was kg and similar to
our findings the authors did not observe
a significant difference in the progres
Sion of GDM to in pregnant in
dividuals without obesity
Clinical implications
Our study demonstrates that the risk of
GDM progression to is doubled
in multifetal pregnancies with GDM
compared with singleton pregnancies
with GDM Furthermore our results
highlight a substantial difference be
tween parturients with and without
obesity
In pregnant individuals without
obesity who carry multifetal pregnancy
GDM did not markedly increase the risk
of progression to Although
limited by sample size this finding is in
line with results of previous studies
showing that GDM in multifetal preg
nancies is less likely to be associated with
accelerated fetal growth
implying
that some degree of hyperglycemia
in multifetal pregnancies could be

Naeh Gestational diabetes mellitus in multifetal gestation and type diabetes mellitus Am J Obstet Gynecol
considered physiological Consistent
with studies showing a higher rate of
small for gestational age fetuses in well
controlled GDM in multifetal pregnan
cies and considering the fact that the
studies by Carpenter Coustan excluded
multifetal pregnancies these findings
suggest a possible need to individualize
the diagnostic criteria and glucose target
levels for GDM in multifetal pregnancies
Conversely although it is well estab
lished that pregnant individuals with
GDM have a high risk of progression to
after delivery it seems that
pregnant individuals with obesity who
carry multifetal pregnancies and develop
GDM represent a special population
with an even higher risk of DM in the
future This heightened risk may be
attributed to a combination of risk
factors including advanced maternal
age polycystic ovary syndrome and the
need for assisted reproductive tech
niques with increased estrogen levels all
linked to both multifetal pregnancies
and In parturients with obesity
excessive adiposity may promote a
proinflammatory state and insulin
resistance which contribute to both
GDM development and later
Previous studies that evaluated combi
nations of risk factors and future DM
demonstrated that GDM alone had a
comparable risk of such as hav
ing risk factors such as obesity or
postdelivery weight retention Hence
we suggest that pregnant individuals
with obesity and multifetal pregnancies
complicated by GDM may require
tailored postpartum interventions
including access to dietitians regular
follow ups and for those at the highest
risk options such as metformin or
bariatric surgery to facilitate early diag
nosis of
Research implications
The first research implication is the need
to develop OGTT thresholds for the
diagnosis of GDM in multifetal preg
nancies based on the risk of developing
and stratified for pregnant in
dividuals with and without obesity Next
these thresholds will need to be evalu
ated for association with adverse peri
natal outcomes

individuals underscoring the substantial
diversity within our study population
The results were adjusted for multiple
confounders including maternal BMI
This adjustment is particularly impor
tant as BMI plays a crucial role in the
progression to and postpartum
care and pregnant individuals with
obesity are advised to undergo DM
screening irrespective of their history of
GDM status Our data are based on an
automatic laboratory database cross
tabulated with a validated daily upda
ted pregnancy registry integrated with
the INDR Last we used only preg
nancy per patient which prevents se
lection bias for high parity parturients
Study limitations mainly derive from
its retrospective nature Several key fac
tors were absent from our dataset
including maternal parity family history
of DM hyperlipidemia and gestational
weight gain In addition data on po
tential postpartum interventions such
as weight loss or bariatric surgeries were
not available for analysis The absence of
parity data along with our strategy to
include each woman only once in the
analysis limited our ability to assess the
potential influence of multifetal
pregnancy exposure as a confounding
factor Regrettably we did not perform a
power analysis before commencing the
research and the registry that we used
had a limited existence of only years
lacking long term data beyond that
period Although our initial cohort was
large it is essential to note that only a
small subset of pregnant individuals with
multifetal pregnancies were affected by
GDM potentially influencing our sta
tistical results Statistical significance
should be interpreted cautiously
considering the sample size variation
between groups
In addition our study is limited by the
INDR s lack of differentiation between
type I DM and Recent research in
Israel highlighted this nonspecificity and
although the effect of type DM on our
results is expected to be minimal it re
mains a limitation The registry s reli
ance on the criterion of purchases of
glucose lowering medications to indicate
is another inherent limitation
Although this criterion has a high sensi
tivity and positive predictive value it may
not definitively distinguish DM related
use from other indications Previous
studies evaluating the reliability of the
registry have reported a sensitivity of
and a positive predictive value of
Moreover the inclusion criteria
restricted our study to patients with live
births potentially affecting the results
The inclusion of triplet pregnancies
although few and without cases of DM is
another aspect to consider Finally our
study was conducted in one of Israel s
HMOs which may raise concerns about
the generalizability of our results How
ever it is crucial to recognize that all
citizens regardless of ethnicity or reli
gious affiliation are mandated to be
affiliated with one of these HMOs under

wide presence and the freedom for
citizens to switch between HMOs
contribute to maintaining a broadly
representative study population en
hancing the potential applicability of our
findings to a broader context
Conclusion
We found that GDM in multifetal preg
nancies has a fold increased risk of
progression to after delivery
compared with GDM singleton preg
nancies especially in patients with

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with pregnancy complications and reduced fetal
growth in populations where total arsenic exposure exceeds gg L However the potential effect on pregnancy
outcomes remains unclear at lower levels of arsenic exposure such as those most commonly observed in the
United States
Objectives We evaluated the associations between arsenic exposure during pregnancy with fetal growth and risk
of pregnancy complications using data from mother infant pairs participating in the National Children s Study
Methods Prenatal arsenic exposure was measured using maternal urine collected during the third trimester
Information about pregnancy complications was abstracted from medical records Fetal growth including ge
stational age birth weight birth length head circumference and ponderal index was ascertained through
physical measurement at birth and extracted from medical records
Results Medians interquartile range IQR of maternal urinary total arsenic and dimethylarsinic acid DMA
were gg L and gg L respectively Each increase in IQR of prenatal total arsenic level was
associated with greater birth length cm CI greater head circumference cm
CI and lower ponderal index kg CI Similar results were
obtained for levels of prenatal DMA Tests for multiplicative interaction indicate that prenatal urinary DMA was
negatively associated with gestational age among female infants week decrease in gestational age es
timated for each IQR increase in DMA CI while no association was observed among male
infants p
No significant associations were detected between arsenic and birth weight or
i nterac tio n
pregnancy complications
Conclusions Higher prenatal arsenic exposure was associated with longer birth length greater head cir
cumference and lower ponderal index Associations between arsenic and gestational age may be modified by
infant sex
Naturally occurring arsenic in the earth s crust leads to widespread
human exposure Arsenic contaminated drinking water is the major
pathway of exposure Chung et al but arsenic exposure through
occupation diet and air pollution can also lead to clinically significant
exposure in populations with no known water exposure Bulka et al
Chronic exposure to arsenic is linked with
Meharg et al

liver bladder kidney and prostate skin lesions cardiovascular dis
ease respiratory disease and diabetes mellitus Abdul et al

Sanchez et al
Pregnant women and their offspring may be particularly susceptible
to the toxic effects of arsenic exposure due to changes in hormone levels
of pregnant women and hemodynamics associated with pregnancy and
the immature immune system rapid differentiation and tissue organ
growth of developing fetuses Cunningham et al
While it is
known that arsenic exposure to a pregnant woman transfers to the
developing fetus

there is
growing consensus among the existing evidence to indicate that arsenic
exposure affects
