By combining the outcomes of topic analysis and sentiment
analysis the results show that in the first month of pregnancy the
number of posts is relatively small mainly focusing on topics
such as test strip and pregnancy tests consultation and the
proportion of emotionally positive posts is also relatively low On
the one hand many pregnant women have not found out that
they are pregnant in the first month of pregnancy on the other
hand the first month of pregnancy is often unstable and at a loss
for pregnant women so their emotions are relatively negative
The number of posts in the second month of pregnancy is the
most but the proportion of posts with positive emotions is also
relatively low In the second month of pregnancy most pregnant
women have already guessed or confirmed pregnancy but new
pregnant women have little knowledge about pregnancy
Therefore posts about precautions for early pregnancy
early pregnancy inspection symptoms of early pregnancy
and other related early pregnancy topics surged However due to
the uncertainty of the baby s status and the lack of relevant
knowledge of pregnant women the proportion of emotionally
positive posts in the second month of pregnancy is relatively low
Frontiers in Physiology
After the first months of relevant inspections and
understanding of pregnancy knowledge pregnant women have
entered a relatively mature stage At the same time the status of
the baby gradually stabilized so the number of posts from the
second month of pregnancy to the third month dropped
significantly and it continued to be stable until the ninth of
pregnancy
The proportion of emotionally positive posts from the third
month to the ninth month of pregnancy is higher than that in
other months and there is an upward trend from the third month
to the sixth month of pregnancy The proportion is the highest in
the sixth month of pregnancy and then gradually decreases After
the third month of pregnancy the baby s state gradually stabilizes
the pregnant women s belly gradually bulges and the pregnant
women can even feel the baby s fetal movement but there is
generally no obvious physical discomfort so the pregnant women s
emotions are relatively more positive Since the seventh month of
pregnancy the baby s weight increases the pregnant women s
belly increases the body gradually becomes clumsy and the body
also has various discomforts such as soreness and difficulty
sleeping so pregnant women show more negative emotions
The number of posts in the tenth month of pregnancy surged
again second only to the second month of pregnancy and the
proportion of emotionally positive posts also dropped sharply
only higher than in the first of pregnancy The tenth month of
pregnancy is the month when the baby is about to be born On
the one hand the pregnant women s body aches and sleep

Hou and Hou
problems are more prominent On the other hand pregnant
women are faced with the uncertainty of childbirth and a state of
fear and anxiety appears It can also be seen from the results of
the topic analysis that in the current month appeals and desire
ranked first among the topics that pregnant women paid
attention to accounting for In addition expected
date of confinement and pregnant women s physical
discomfort are also the main contents of concern for
pregnant women
Discussion and conclusion
Summary of findings
The purpose of the current study was to investigate pregnant
women s information seeking behavior By a combination of
descriptive analysis topic analysis and sentiment analysis the
current work expands our knowledge by proving important
findings The correlation analysis showed that more pregnant
women contribute to more posts Moreover pregnant women
with a college education or above are more likely to seek
information about pregnancy on internet platforms The more
economically developed cities have higher Internet usage
Therefore pregnant women will be more probable to use
Internet platforms to seek information
Furthermore the topics from the first month to the tenth
month of pregnancy were extracted in topic analysis The
findings show that the topics in different months of
pregnancy relate to the present stages of pregnancy The
current paper identified six nineteen eighteen thirteen
eleven sixteen thirteen sixteen nineteen and fourteen topics
in different months of pregnancy The specific topics in different
stages show the changes in pregnant women s attention
In addition the sentiment analysis showed the variation of
pregnant women s emotions in information seeking The results
of sentiment analysis show a peak of the posts in the second
month of pregnancy The proportion of emotionally positive
posts reached its peak in the sixth month of pregnancy Pregnant
women s emotional sentiment deeply interacts with the results of
topic analysis
Practical and theoretical implications
Our study presents theoretical and practical significance
First this is one of the first studies to understand pregnant
women s information seeking using the methods of data mining
and text analysis Previous studies on the information needs of
maternal health revealed the topics that pregnant women pay
attention to however the existing work is limited in the
descriptive analysis and self reported questionnaire data
Kamali et al Ahmadian et al Jin et al
Frontiers in Physiology
fphys
Kassim This study is unique by employing enormous
quantities of data and the research data covers a long period By
visualizing the posts of every province the geographical
distribution of pregnant women s posts was clearly displayed
The current study enriches our understanding of the
relationships among pregnant women s information seeking
regional economic development level and educational level
Second this study provides comprehensive research
involving abundant analysis Compared with previous research
Kamali et al the current work divides the data from the
first month of pregnancy to the tenth month of pregnancy and
analyzes the large amounts of data according to the pregnancy
period This study provides important insights for understanding
the change of emotions during different pregnant stages and
connecting the changes of emotions with the topics that cause
pregnant women s attention The current work provides the
perspectives for future research by the subdivision of data in
different pregnant stages
Third the findings of this study have several practical
implications The findings indicate that pregnant women pay
attention to different topics during various months of pregnancy
The maternal and infant related websites should provide
customized information recommendations for pregnant
women according to their stages of pregnancy For example
information such as precautions and inspection for early
pregnancy should be recommended for pregnant women in
the second month of pregnancy Moreover the proportion of
emotionally positive posts reached its peak in the sixth month of
pregnancy and is relatively low in the first and the tenth of
pregnancy The relevant government management departments
and hospitals should concern about anxiety during early
pregnancy and before delivery The popularization of
knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth would be useful
for improving pregnant women s emotions
Limitations and future research
The study is subject to several inevitable limitations First the
data source of this study is Mama cn mainly located in China
What is now needed in the future is a cross national study
involving data for countries at different levels of development
The present study lays the groundwork for future research into
pregnant women s information seeking behavior around the
world Future studies are encouraged to improve the
generalizability of the current work by involving data from
different countries and understanding the role of cultural
identity in determining pregnant women s information
seeking Second the data such as personal attributes and
specific family environments are not included in the paper
since such data cannot be obtained from the website It would
be interesting to investigate the effect of family related variables
on pregnant women s emotional sentiment in future work

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Women receive many public health messages relating to pregnancy which are intended
to improve outcomes for babies and mothers However negotiating the risk landscape and maternity
care system can feel confusing and disempowering Relationships between women and their healthcare
providers are paramount but they can be adversely affected by issues of trust and autonomy
Methods We used a nested study design including an online survey and qualitative interviews to gain
an understanding of women s experiences of risk messages during pregnancy We purposively sampled
survey participants to ensure the interview population included women whose voices are seldom heard
and are disproportionately impacted by poor risk communication
Results A total of women responded to the survey and women participated in interviews Par
ticipants received public health and risk messages from a range of sources Data showed that women
wanted a balance between a better safe than sorry approach and evidence based information and ad
vice Women reported a discrepancy between the topics they received a lot of information on and areas
in which they felt they needed more advice Many participants said they were given conflicting advice
and the way information was delivered sometimes challenged their autonomy We identified that younger
women years old and women with higher BMIs experienced stigmatisation in their maternity care
Conclusions Our research shows the importance of risk communication that respects women s auton
omy and trusts them to make decisions about their own pregnancy We identified a need for a layered
approach to risk communication Whilst some women are happy to adopt precautionary behaviour with
out discussion others will want a thorough examination of the evidence base Our findings suggest that
more individualised care continuity and less judgement and stigmatisation from HCPS will improve ex
periences for women and may lead to better engagement with services

Public health messages or messages about risk regarding be
haviours during pregnancy form one aspect of a laudable agenda
to improve pregnancy outcomes and give babies a better start in
life during the first days First days of life
These messages are based on an understanding that information
and clear direction will lead expectant parents primarily moth
ers to make decisions that reduce the risk to the pregnancy and
of their babies experiencing short and longer term adverse health
outcomes

Pregnancy is often characterised as a teachable moment dur
ing which women are receptive to the provision of public health
messages and interventions Antenatal care Atkinson et al
One consequence is that women before and during preg
nancy are subjected to a wide range of messages about how to
reduce or manage a multitude of risks As part of routine ante
natal care midwives are expected to provide information on diet
smoking and substance misuse weight management emotional
and mental health exercise pre existing medical conditions foetal
movements and pregnancy related symptoms all in addition to
providing clinical monitoring of the woman and her pregnancy
Sanders et al Family members friends and parenting ex
perts also contribute their own sometimes contradictory opinions
and experiences New study findings introduce an increasing range
of risks and benefits
from avoiding air pollution Smith et al
to eating more broccoli Li et al These findings are

reported in press statements and media headlines which do not
always fully reflect the nuances of results which may create alarm
or additional pressure for women and the people who care for
them Marshall et al
The volume and intensity of instruction may be leading to un
intended negative effects
including excessive maternal anxiety
Rowe and Fisher and a failure to deliver personalised care
that addresses individuals concerns Sanders et al Further
more risks may not always be communicated in a way that reflects
or explains the limitations of the evidence base Sharp et al
Elements of current pregnancy related public health advice
have been challenged on the basis that they are insuffciently
nuanced For example research which sought women s experi
ences of the UK Governments guidance to abstain from drink
ing alcohol in pregnancy raised concerns about the communica
tion of the precautionary principle the better safe than sorry ap
proach
Communicating public health alcohol guidance for expec
tant mothers Other concerns highlighted were the risk of
irresolvable anxiety amongst women who had drunk alcohol be
fore they knew they were pregnant and the encouragement of so
Cial surveillance of women s decisions Alarm has also been raised
about the extension of pregnancy risk messaging to all women
of childbearing age including the recent World Health Organiza
tion draft recommendation that all women with childbearing po
tential abstain from drinking alcohol Global alcohol action plan
Some suggest that the current risk messaging context may
be driving a wider culture of parenting that tends to hold mothers
responsible for any and all ills that befall their children Lee and
Bristow In some countries such as the USA mothers are
held maximally responsible and sometimes imprisoned for be
haviours that may harm the foetus in utero such as taking illegal
and even prescription drugs Negpor and
We anticipated that the challenges in negotiating risk messages
disproportionately affect women who have pre existing or preg
nancy complications or who are more vulnerable in other ways
Women who are taking medications have higher BMIs older
or younger than the contemporaneous mean or those living in
poverty can all find themselves under pressure to change their
behaviour whilst also finding risks more diffcult to avoid Moth
ers themselves and those responsible for their care sometimes
struggle to balance maternal need for pharmacological treatments
with limiting foetal exposure to potentially teratogenic medica
tions
Lawthom The MBBRACE UK inquiries have identified
advice to pregnant women to discontinue antidepressants as a con
tributory factor in maternal suicide and there are concerns that
restrictions on sodium valproate use amongst women of reproduc
tive age may result in the deaths of pregnant women with epilepsy
Knight et al A failure to prioritise maternal health can also
have grave impacts for a woman s foetus New research suggests
that of women with Hyperemesis Gravidarum who did not re
ceive appropriate treatment had an abortion and over half consid
ered terminating otherwise wanted pregnancies Nana et al
We aimed to gain an in depth understanding of women s lived
experiences of pregnancy related risk messages and public health
advice across a wide range of topics and issues
Aims
To describe women s lived experiences of risk communication
relating to pregnancy in the United Kingdom and how this
varies for
a women with higher BMIs kg
b women who make decisions relating to medications includ
ing for Hyperemesis Gravidarum and for depression or anx
iety
c younger women

To describe which aspects or topics relating to risk communi
cation for pregnancy are problematic for women and why
To explore how women experience risk communication in
terms of prioritising foetal and maternal health
To explore how women experience the communication of un
certainty and the precautionary principle as part of risk mes
saging
Methods
Study design
We used a mixed methods nested design consisting of an on
line survey and in depth interviews with a sub sample of survey
respondents
Study population
The study population consisted of women who were pregnant
or who had been pregnant in the last five years This included
women whose pregnancy ended in a live birth miscarriage still
birth or termination of pregnancy
Inclusion criteria
Women aged years old
Women who were or had been pregnant within the last years
Women who were living in the United Kingdom
Exclusion criteria
Women with insuffcient English to participate in the online
survey or interviews
The survey and interviews were inclusive of all people who had
been pregnant in the last five years We use the word women col
lectively throughout this paper as that is how most participants
self identify but refer to individuals using their self described gen
der We use the term BAME but acknowledge that this is prob
lematic and present our data on ethnicity in more granular and
specific terms in

Table
Data collection
Survey
The online survey was developed in collaboration with the
project advisory group A pilot of the survey allowed the re
search team to draw on feedback from users and test dissemina
tion strategies
A participant information sheet and consent form were inte
grated into the survey The survey included questions on partici
pants experience of the advice information and support they re
ceived from different sources during pregnancy with the focus on
the respondent s most recent pregnancy Questions with open free
text responses were included alongside questions with Likert scales
and multiple choice responses Data on sociodemographic charac
teristics were collected We also asked survey participants whether
they would be prepared to be contacted for a future one to one in
terview
The survey was hosted on SurveyMonkey Surveymonkey
took approximately min to complete and was open
between June and August There were questions in
total although the final questions were focused on participation
in future research including the interviews Data generated by the
other questions are presented in the results section
The survey was disseminated through Facebook s inbuilt adver
tising feature which invited women aged years from across
the UK to participate and through partner organisations that work

One to one interviews
To gain an in depth understanding of women s experiences we
also conducted interviews A sampling frame was designed to en
sure of the interview sample were eligible for means tested
State benefits at least of the sample were from Black Asian
and Minority Ethnic BAME backgrounds and included at least six
women with experience of pregnancy advice in relation to

having a termination due to a perceived or actual risk either to
themselves or their foetus baby
Some participants fell into more than one of these categories
Survey participants that met the sampling criteria were selected
to be contacted using a random number table until the required
numbers were obtained
The participant information sheets PIS consent forms and
topic guides for the interviews were developed in collaboration
with the project advisory group Several topic guides were tailored
to ensure they were suitable for participants who experienced dif
ferent pregnancy outcomes e g stillbirth live birth termination
Narrative topic guides allowed participants to tell their pregnancy
stories in chronological order Participants were asked to discuss
their most recent pregnancy however many also drew on their
wider experiences of pregnancy and parenthood
Interviews including pilot interviews were carried out by two
experienced female members of the research team RB and HT
between April and November of Interviews lasted approx
imately min Participants were offered the option of in
person or telephone interviews Two pilot interviews were con
ducted in person and were deemed to be of a high enough quality

Sociodemographic information and pregnancy history for the
survey population is presented in
Table and for the interview
subpopulation in Table
Sources of information and advice
Participants received information about how to have a healthy
pregnancy from a range of sources In addition to their healthcare
providers HCPs women sought out or received information from
social media the mainstream media family and friends often with
contradictory messages
Media
Several participants reflected on the emotional impact of read
ing scaremongering stories in the traditional media One woman
described how she had read an article about avoiding carrying
heavy items during pregnancy and subsequently believed she had
experienced a miscarriage because she had carried a car seat up a
flight of stairs
I remember reading somewhere you shouldn t be carrying heavy
loads and things this that and the other l think I was moving
my daughter s car seat from my car and I carried it up a flight
of stairs and then literally I think a day or two later that s when
I had the miscarriage I m thinking maybe it was because of that
that s why it happened
Whilst many participants described panicking about every
thing feeling stressed and helpless many also
recognised that warnings about avoiding risks during pregnancy

Social media
The majority of interview participants spoke about social me
dia being a source of helpful information and advice and many
had positive experiences of due date Facebook groups Simi
larly participants who had conditions such as Hyperemesis Gravi
darum found that social media provided peer support However
many also recognised that social media was rife with mislead
ing information and contradictory advice Participants who were
in transnational pregnancy support groups noted the contradiction
in pregnancy related advice across countries such as the number
of routine antenatal check ups offered to women
Family and friends
Participants were overwhelmingly positive about the support
provided to them by friends and their own mothers In addition to
providing practical support they offered advice and reassurance in
the face of an overwhelming landscape of pregnancy related risk
information as was the case with WRII who described how her
mum supported her when she was concerned about taking medi
cation prescribed for Hyperemesis Gravidarum
I think my mum was very supportive and saying like If the doc
tors have prescribed it it ll be fine and like you need it basi
cally WRII
Partners were described by a small number of participants as
being helpful and supportive However several participants ex
pressed that they felt pressure to consider their partner s feelings
when making decisions about their lifestyle during pregnancy One
woman described how her partner asked her to give up Coca Cola
When you ve got someone else in your life perhaps who s panick
ing and like Argh it s a little bit more pressure than you would
want You have to tell them to calm down and rein it in a little
bit Like It s going to be okay don t worry you know I m still
going to look after myself I m still going to look after this baby
Better safe than sorry
The survey data showed that women wanted a balance between
a better safe than sorry approach and evidence based informa
tion and advice Table The majority n either
strongly or tended to agree that when scientists cannot rule
out the possibility of harm pregnant women should take a better
safe than sorry approach and n
wanted straight
forward do or don t advice There were some scenarios in which
participants felt a particularly strong need to exercise caution and
adopt the precautionary principle including when making deci
R Blaylock H Trickey J Sanders et al
sions around the consumption of alcohol and use of prescription
medication
Because no one really knows what s a safe amount and what isn t
and they are saying now aren t they just don t bother drinking
anything because we don t know what is a safe amount I ve had
maybe three drinks during pregnancy and not even finished them
So god such a negligible amount It s been absolutely fine I ve
been alright with that I ve felt really good And I think I needed
that I ve just seen it as like a detox
Despite the support for the precautionary principle most sur
vey respondents n also wanted to have all the avail
able evidence in order to make their own decisions about their
pregnancy Survey free text responses and interview data showed
that this extended to situations where there was a paucity of evi
dence or uncertainty
A lot of standard advice seems to be based on a better safe than
sorry mindset especially as it s not always possible to conduct high
quality studies on pregnant women to generate robust evidence I
personally find it more useful to understand the evidence base and
use this to make informed decisions rather than be given a list of
rules to follow Every individual and every pregnancy is different
and a do don t approach fails to acknowledge this survey respon
dent
Some participants recognised that their own circumstances
made them more cautious about certain decisions and behaviours
This was particularly the case with women who had experienced a
previous pregnancy loss who exercised a greater deal of caution in
subsequent pregnancies
I put two and two together in that scenario and thought Yes
that s my fault
I can t change it I just think when it came
to my next pregnancy I changed my habits I really really toned
down my drinking especially in the run up to getting pregnant I
think I waited before I would have a glass of wine at weddings
and stuff like that I think I probably waited until I was well over
the weeks
Information gaps
In the interviews and survey women reported a discrepancy
between the topics they received a lot of information on and areas
in which they felt they needed more advice The following were
the top four topics that participants said were well explained
what to not to eat during pregnancy n
vaccina
tions during pregnancy for influenza and whooping cough
n smoking before and during pregnancy n
and drinking alcohol before and during pregnancy n
In contrast participants wanted more advice and information
on managing mental health and pregnancy n man
aging stress and pregnancy n
infections such as
Group B Streptococcus Toxoplasmosis and Cytomegalovirus
and infant feeding n Many participants
expressed that they received information that was not relevant to
them at the expense of other areas where they needed better sup
port
Although I didn t smoke or drink I received much better informa
tion on this than anything else I didn t receive any information on
maintaining good mental health during pregnancy and I feel this
contributed to me developing PND survey respondent
Furthermore participants described feeling unable to act on the
information about risk given to them This was particularly the
case with mental health conditions and risk factors which were
unmodifiable at the time of pregnancy such as age or weight
Midwifery
God I couldn t tell you which journal this paper came out in but
it was the study that looked at elevated cortisol in pregnant women
and behavioural issues in their children That really stuck with me
because it came out and I was the most stressed person I was so
stressed and I was trying to do things to de stress but life was just so
all over the place that nothing worked
Conflicting advice
Many participants said they were given conflicting advice by
HCPs on a range of issues including what to expect during labour
and birth diagnosis of pregnancy related conditions and the
safety of alcohol consumption during pregnancy A few women
also noted that advice at the policy level had changed over the
course of each of their pregnancies leading to confusion
I ve had four pregnancies in four years so one in
and every single time the differences in just the protocols the
way things have changed information and how you re given it Ev
ery single time it s been completely different
Several participants described conflicting messages from HCPS
about the safety of medication in pregnancy
As soon as she GPI saw that I was on medication for mental
health she was like So you re on antidepressants I said Yes
She went Well what are we going to do about that I was like
Well my midwife said it s fine the risk to my baby The risk to
myself if I came off them outweighed that and it s a very minimal
risk I was on a low dose She said It s not okay It s not okay
She was very sharp with me It s like as if I was taking hard drugs
her something her reaction was She wouldn t give me a prescrip
tion for Citalopram She said You need to go on Sertraline I said
I don t feel comfortable with changing meds at the moment It
took me a long time to find Citalopram and that really suits me
She was like But you can t breastfeed on Citalopram She was
assuming a lot of things because I wasn t planning on breastfeed
ing anyway I took the prescription from her for Sertraline and I
was crying after the appointment I went to the pharmacy think
ing I ll just do it Then the pharmacy were really funny with me
because I was getting Citalopram and Sertraline because I needed
to wean myself off Citalopram first to start the Sertraline That was
humiliating because it was in front of everybody
Such conflicting messages are not without consequences In ad
dition to the anxiety and distress caused contradictory messages
around the safety of medication can lead women to abstain from
taking prescribed medication out of fear of harming their baby
I am epileptic and though my seizures increased during pregnancy
I was too scared to tell my midwife as I was afraid of my medica
tion being increased and the risks to my unborn baby I ended up
being hospitalised during pregnancy because of my seizures and
my daughter had to be delivered early by caesarean section I be
lieve if I had been given more information about the medication
including risks and percentages that I wouldn t of been so scared
to increase my medication survey respondent
Challenges to autonomy
The way in which information about risk was delivered to
women sometimes challenged their autonomy and had negative
implications for their relationships with their HCPS Table
Many
women initially implicitly trusted their HCPs However partial or
inaccurate advice from HCPS was a source of anxiety for women
and sometimes led to poor care
I d asked several times Is there anything I can take for that
and she d said No there s nothing we can give you You just have
