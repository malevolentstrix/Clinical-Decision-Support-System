On the other hand our analysis showed that identifica

referral outs decreased
Uptake of ASMAN application
We have included completeness of case sheets in appli
cation as a measure of data quality as it is a commonly
assessed dimension of data quality mentioned in a re
view Although using medical records has been
criticized for measuring quality of record keeping prac
tices instead of quality of care it was argued that patient
case records should be part of quality of care assessment
because individual case records are essential not only for
case management and peer review but also for assessing
the impact of health interventions Additionally it
was noted that clinical record keeping enables continuity
of care and improves communication between different
health providers
Fig Trend of neonata
Our results indicated that the filling ratio during the
post partum period was low across all type of facilities
The poor clinical documentation was reported in a re
view of obstetric records conducted in India with
the extent of documentation varying between as
sessment of mother s condition at the discharge and
admission date Similarly a multicenter retro
spective review of clinical records of cesarean delivery in
five low income countries identified poor quality record
keeping with missing information on key events man
agement of complications and delivery outcomes
Furthermore we have found that the filling ratio across
all pause points was low at the district hospital level and
high delivery load facilities In our qualitative study
health care providers mentioned that staff shortage pa
tient urgency high caseloads prevented staff to complete
all fields in the application According to a study
conducted by Chaturvedi and colleagues Madhya
Pradesh state of India documentation was better at dis
trict hospitals due to higher qualification of the staff in
those facilities and availability of forms at the district
hospitals Although the present study did not conduct

compare to paper based records Understanding the rea
sons for the low filling ratios at the PNC period would
require further research The low filling ratio at facilities
with delivery load more than could be explained by
bigger client provider ratio could be reasons as per an
ecdotal experience
Adherence to key clinical practices
Our study revealed that quality of care across all pause
points improved during the implementation of ASMAN
application Furthermore labor room staff in the
qualitative study mentioned that ASMAN application
improved their ability to take a complete history and
physical exam identify high risk patients manage cases
confidently facilitate provider communication improve
reporting processes and ensure continuity of care for re
ferral patients In our study we have observed that
examinations around identification and management of
complications initiation of partograph identification of
post partum haemorrhage increased significantly These
results indicate that ASMAN application has the poten
tial to improve quality of care provided around the
childbirth These are very encouraging results as timely
identification of complications is crucial because over a
third of maternal deaths a significant proportion of
pregnancy related life threatening conditions approxi
mately half of all stillbirths and a quarter of neonatal
deaths are attributed to complications that occur during
labour childbirth or the immediate postpartum period
Our findings are in line with the results of three
systematic reviews on the role of CDSS use on providers
adherence to clinical practices According to

Garg and colleagues better performance of pro
viders was observed in studies where users were auto
matically prompted to use the systems compared with
studies in which users were required to actively initi
ate the system Additionally the same review ob
served better performance in studies in which the
trial authors also developed the CDSS software
Moreover a synthesis of high quality systematic re
views showed that the positive effect of CDSS
depends on the services which it was used CDSS
positively impacted providers performance in studies
on drugs ordering and preventive care measures
Kawamoto et al identified four features strongly
associated with a decision support system s ability to
improve clinical practice a decision support pro
vided automatically as part of clinician workflow b
decision support delivered at the time and location of
decision making c actionable recommendations pro
vided and d computer based Additionally CDSS
should also provide periodic performance feedback
request documentation of the reason for not following
system recommendations and share decision support
results with patients
While there are studies on benefits of CDSS in general
there is very limited research on benefits of CDCC in
maternity care Duysburgh et al did not find a sig
nificant improvement in quality of antenatal and delivery
care with the use of CDSS assessed in Burkina Faso
Ghana and Tanzania They have concluded that history
taking counselling health education laboratory investi
gations and examination and monitoring of mothers
and newborns during childbirth were not performed ac
cording to the standards A study conducted in South
Africa for improving compliance of health care workers
with antenatal care guidelines found overall improve
ment but it was not statistically significant
McNabb et al reports significant improvement in health
counselling technical services quality of health educa
tion and patient satisfaction as a result of a mobile
phone decision support during antenatal care in Nigeria
Furthermore studies conducted in India on the role of
CDSS in the management of cardiovascular diseases
and hypertension demonstrated positive role of
CDSS in improving care adherence to guidelines coun
selling and follow up with patients that resulted in blood
pressure reduction
Delivery outcomes and maternal complications
Improved practices around childbirth have a potential to
prevent birth asphyxia and complications due to prema
turity which are some of the main causes of fresh still
births and early neonatal deaths Our results
revealed that there was a significant decrease in fresh
Page of
still birth and asphyxia however this decrease wasn t sta
tistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
These results are in line with the global evidence on the
lack of evidence of potential impact of CDSS on patient
outcomes Thus according to the sys
tematic review majority of the studies assessed patient
outcomes often without adequate statistical power to de
tect clinically important differences Jaspers and col
leagues found only few studies on impact of CDSS on
patient outcomes though many of these have been too
small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinic
ally important effect Furthermore a systematic re
view and meta analysis found that CDSS linked to
electronic health records did not detect statistically sig
nificant reduction in morbidity and mortality
The lack of statistically significant improvement in de
livery outcomes could be attributed to the small sample
size and short follow up periods which is not long
enough to assess the impact of CDSS on patient out
comes
During the course of the program implementation
we have observed that identification of pre eclampsia
is increased while referrals for the same conditions
decreased This change could be attributed to the
improved assessment at the time of admission
Moreover we have observed the same trend in iden
tification and referral of postpartum hemorrhage that
could be explained by increased administration of
oxytocin within min of delivery
Strengths and limitations
The results of our study contributes to the dearth of lit
erature on the role of CDSS in maternity care From the
onset of the program our team trained and worked
closely with the focal point in each facility to ensure
quality of data and timely reporting Furthermore as a
part of program implementation all providers were
trained in distinguishing and reporting fresh still births
Additionally data reported from facilities were regularly
validated by our team The availability of data before
and during the program implementation allowed us to
estimate the role of CDSS in improving quality of intra
partum care and delivery outcomes Our study has few
limitations Firstly it is possible that providers carried
out the patient management according to the standards
but didn t record it in application Secondly our assess
ment involved direct observation of provider practices
as a result potential Hawthorne effect would have hap
pened To minimize Hawthorne effect we trained our
project officers using standard observation checklist and
standard operating procedures Lastly due to utilization
of program data in our analysis establishing causal claim
is limited
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Conclusion
To our knowledge this is the first study that provides
and evidence on the role of technology to improve the
quality of intrapartum care and delivery outcomes in
India However the results of this study could be gener
alized to another country with similar settings Our
study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality
of intrapartum care and delivery outcome Future studies
with rigorous study design are required to understand
the impact of technology in improving quality of mater
nity care These studies could provide evidence on redu
cing the burden of maternal and neonatal death
attributable to inadequate quality of care in India and
globally

Associations between pre pregnancy psychosocial risk
factors and infant outcomes a population based cohort
study in England
Katie Harron Ruth Gilbert Jamie Fagg Astrid Guttmann Jan van der Meulen
Summary
Background Existing studies evaluating the association between maternal risk factors and specific infant outcomes such
as birthweight injury admissions and mortality have mostly focused on single risk factors We aimed to identify
routinely recorded psychosocial characteristics of pregnant women most at risk of adverse infant outcomes to inform
targeting of early intervention
Methods We created a cohort using administrative hospital data Hospital Episode Statistics for all births to mothers
aged years in England UK who gave birth on or after April and who were discharged before or on
March We used generalised linear models to evaluate associations between psychosocial risk factors recorded
in hospital records in the years before the week of pregnancy ie teenage motherhood deprivation pre
pregnancy hospital admissions for mental health or behavioural conditions and pre pregnancy hospital admissions
for adversity including drug or alcohol abuse violence and self harm and infant outcomes ie birthweight
unplanned admission for injury or death from any cause within months from postnatal discharge
Findings Of births initially assessed were eligible and were included in the birth outcome analysis
Among the eligible births were births to teenage mothers age years were births to
previous teenage mothers were births to mothers who had a history of hospital admissions for mental
health or behavioural conditions were births to mothers who had a history of hospital admissions for
adversity and were births to mothers living in areas of high deprivation of births
were to mothers with none of the above risk factors Infants born to mothers with any of these risk factors had poorer
outcomes than those born to mothers without these risk factors Those born to mothers with a history of mental health
or behavioural conditions were g lighter CI g than those born to mothers without these conditions
For teenage mothers compared with older mothers CI more infants had an unplanned
admission for injury and there were CI more deaths per infants
Interpretation Health care services should respond proactively to pre pregnancy psychosocial risk factors Our study
demonstrates a need for effective interventions before during and after pregnancy to reduce the downstream burden
on health services and prevent long term adverse effects for children

Introduction
Psychosocial factors in pregnant women that are not
addressed can have adverse effects on outcomes of preg
nancy for both mothers and their infants l Guidelines
from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
recommend that women with complex social risk factors
should be identified during pregnancy so that additional
support can be provided These guidelines recognise
that vulnerable women often experience a range of
social risk factors simultaneously and highlight the
specific needs of teenage mothers aged years women
who misuse substances and women who experience
domestic violence
Targeted support for women before and during preg
nancy has the potential to improve outcomes at and after
birth through promoting preconception health and
www thelancet com public health February
reproductive choices and mitigating the adverse effects of
maternal stress Postnatal support can positively affect
the quality of caregiving and child attachment and the
development and behaviour of the child furthermore it
can mitigate the effects of adversity and reduce the risk of
unmet medical need or child injury Appropriate early
intervention can therefore lead to improved maternal and
neonatal outcomes and health education and social
outcomes throughout childhood
In England maternity services and primary care
during and after pregnancy are universal and freely
available for the approximately births per year
with home visiting support delivered through the
Healthy Child Programme g The frequency of home
visits and contact varies according to a proportionate
universalism model meaning that whereas support is

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies published in English between
Jan and May using the MeSH terms
pregnancy outcome birthweight infant mortality OR
infant newborn AND maternal age adolescence parity
social class substance related disorders violence OR
mental disorders We reviewed studies from high income
countries that addressed maternal risk factors before and
during pregnancy in relation to birth outcomes or infant
hospital admissions or mortality Previous cohort and
administrative data longitudinal studies have examined the
association between young maternal age and parity and
specific maternal or infant health outcomes and they have
found that young maternal age is associated with low
birthweight preterm birth and increased health care use
throughout childhood Population based cohorts also report
links between poor maternal mental health during pregnancy
and low birthweight or preterm birth and between poor
maternal mental health during pregnancy and injury and
respiratory symptoms in children Other studies have found
increased risks of infant morbidity and mortality or poor child
development associated with risky behaviours of the mother
recorded during pregnancy including smoking drug or alcohol
misuse or poor diet mother exposure to intimate partner
violence maternal mental health or lack of antenatal care
Many studies have also highlighted disparities for those with
lower versus higher social status and differences in risk of
adverse infant and child health outcomes by ethnicity race or
Aboriginal status Most studies focused on single risk factors
we did not find any studies using population based
administrative data to quantify the association of multiple
psychosocial risk factors that are routinely recorded by health

injury admissions and mortality
Added value of this study
This population based cohort study examined data from more
than million mother baby pairs in National Health Service
hospitals in England UK over years This study showed that
pre pregnancy psychosocial risk factors routinely recorded in
universal scale and intensity is proportionate to the level
of need and disadvantage g In practice groups who
stand to benefit from additional support ie for whom
early intervention might be effective are identified as
those likely to experience adverse health outcomes
Previous evidence has identified associations between
poor birth and infant outcomes and risk factors that
are routinely recorded in hospital records such as
young maternal age parity risky behaviours including
smoking drug or alcohol misuse or poor diet exposure
to intimate partner violence maternal mental health
and poor engagement with antenatal care services
Routine hospital records can be used to identify
psychosocial risk factors and their influence on child
hospitalisation records before weeks of pregnancy
ie previous birth before years of age hospital contacts
related to adversity or mental health or behavioural conditions
and deprivation were associated with substantially increased
risks of low birthweight preterm birth injury and death during
the months from postnatal discharge Maternal age of less
than years for the current or previous birth was an important
risk factor but hospitalisations before pregnancy for drug or
alcohol abuse self harm or violence or for mental health or
behavioural conditions were also important irrespective of
maternal age These groups could potentially benefit from
health and social interventions before and during pregnancy
Implications of all the available evidence
This research shows a need for effective interventions before
during and after pregnancy to reduce the downstream burden
on health services and prevent long term adverse effects for
children including low birthweight unplanned admission for
injury and mortality In addition to the of mothers who
were teenagers at the current or a previous birth we found that
the of women aged years who could be routinely
identified from hospital data before pregnancy as having a
history of admission to hospital for adversity or mental health or
behavioural conditions also had poor birth and infant outcomes
as did those living in the most deprived population quintile
Improved data collection sharing and linkage across multiple
data sources and efforts across primary and secondary care to
respond to psychosocial risk factors in women using health care
especially among maternity and health visiting services
could improve support for women before during and after
pregnancy and potentially reduce adverse outcomes
More research is needed to develop effective interventions for
women with different risk factors Given the disparities in
outcomes across quintiles of deprivation ie poorer outcomes
for the of births to women living in the most deprived
areas strategies to address the root causes of social
disadvantage are also required Our findings apply to England
but could be generalisable to other countries with similar
maternal risk factors
However most previous studies focused
outcomes
on single risk factors and there is a gap in the evidence
on which of these risk factors when considered
together are associated with the highest risk There is
an absence of studies using routine records to explore
multiple psychosocial risk factors across maternal age
groups before and during early pregnancy
Understanding which women are most vulnerable and
how to identify them in time for intervention is the first
step to the effective development and targeting of early
health and social support programmes This study used
population based hospital data to evaluate the association
between multiple maternal psychosocial risk factors
that can be identified routinely and early in pregnancy

Methods
Study design and participants
This study is a population based cohort study in England
Hospital records were obtained from Hospital Episode
Statistics HES an administrative database holding
detailed information for all admissions to the National
Health Service hospitals in England Admission records
allow the entry of up to fields of clinical diagnoses
coded using the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems Revision
ICD IO
The study population consisted of a cohort of mother
baby pairs which was created by probabilistic linkage of
deliveries and livebirths within HES We included
mother baby pairs when births were singleton births
mothers were aged years at delivery delivery
occurred on or after April and discharge
happened before and on March We excluded the
small number of births to mothers aged years and
older because adverse outcomes for this group might
relate to biological age rather than the social risk factors
and these age related risk factors are less likely to be
amenable to intervention We excluded births to mothers
younger than years because of the small numbers For
mothers with multiple deliveries during the study period
we used a random number generator to select one
mother baby pair for inclusion in analyses to avoid
clustering of outcomes within mothers We did not
restrict analyses to the first child so that we could
consider parity and so that our findings would be more
widely generalisable Approvals for the use of HES data
were obtained as part of the standard Hospital Episode
Statistics approval process and ethical approval was
obtained from London South East Research Ethics
Committee reference LO HES records were
made available by NHS Digital
Outcomes
We chose outcomes that might be amenable to support
for women before during or after pregnancy and that
align with the priorities of English National Health
Service antenatal care and the Healthy Child Pro
gramme First we described birthweight because
low birthweight is a predictor of substantial morbidity
Birthweight was modelled as a continuous variable and
babies born weighing less than g were categorised
as having low birthweight We also described gestational
age based on best estimates from menstrual dates or

ultrasound and size for gestation at birth These
variables were derived from maternity fields in infant or
mother HES records We then evaluated the number of
infants with one or more unplanned hospital admissions
for injury within months from postnatal discharge
Reducing hospital admissions and accidents is a high
impact area of the Healthy Child Programme and
th come is considered to be amenable to change
through postnatal support delivered by health visitors
Admissions were defined as unplanned on the basis of
the method of admission code ie excluding elective
admissions and comprised episodes of care in any
hospital captured within the HES data starting more
than days after the end of the birth episode We used
published lists of ICD IO diagnosis codes to identify
admissions for injury appendix pp Finally we see Online for appendix
measured infant mortality in the months following
postnatal discharge referred to as post discharge
mortality We evaluated these infant outcomes from
postnatal discharge rather than birth to reflect events at
home in the care of parents and to allow for different
lengths of stay during the birth or delivery admission
Risk factors
We pre specified a number of psychosocial risk factors
on the basis of the guidelines for antenatal care for
women with complex social needs namely teenage
motherhood ie mothers aged years at delivery
previous teenage motherhood ie mothers aged years
or older at delivery with a previous birth when aged
years history of adversity related admissions
for violence substance misuse or self harm history of
admissions for mental health or behavioural conditions
excluding self harm and living in areas of high
deprivation
To define histories of adversity or histories of mental
health or behavioural conditions we examined hospital
admission records in the years before the mothers
week of pregnancy We chose weeks on the basis of
recommendations that nearly all women have their
first antenatal contact usually a booking appointment
before this time Guidelines recommend that women
are examined by weeks of pregnancy but the first
examination is often later for women with risk factors
approximately of all women are seen by weeks of
gestation Although recording of these risk factors might
also occur after weeks of pregnancy we aimed to define
risk factors that could be identified early in pregnancy We
used a year look back period for hospital admissions
because this period before birth is likely to have effects on
outcomes and should be in the patient records or could be
asked about by clinicians We also examined the number
of women identified as having a history of mental health
conditions or adversity within year and within years
before the weeks of pregnancy We identified previous
admissions for adversity violence substance misuse
self harm or mental health or behavioural conditions
Articles
on the basis of published lists of ICD IO diagnosis codes
appendix pp We chose to categorise self harm
within the adversity category because it is a behaviour or
event which can be a manifestation of a mental health
condition and to align with previous literature
Quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation were derived
from the national distribution of the Index of Multiple
Deprivation on the basis of the postcode of residence
at delivery Areas of high deprivation were defined
as those within the most deprived quintile We also
described parity and ethnicity Mothers were classified as
primiparous if the number of previous pregnancies
recorded on the maternity record was zero unless we
found a previous delivery for the mother present in HES
records from onwards Previous teenage birth
was defined according to age at first birth recorded in
HES a small proportion of mothers might have been
misclassified if they had their first birth before
ie IO years before the study period or before entering
the HES cohort eg immigrant mothers Ethnic group
was derived from the maternal record
Statistical analysis
Because this study was a population based study no
sample size calculation was done We first calculated the
number of women experiencing each risk factor and the
association between risk factors and maternal age group
We then used generalised linear models to estimate
the association between individual year of maternal
age psychosocial risk factors and outcomes using
Schoenberg B splines for age to allow for a non linear
effect This approach is based on a set of reference
points or knots with the number of points chosen to
balance smoothness and goodness of fit To avoid
overfitting in such a large study cohort we present
results from models with a minimal number of a priori
reference points at ages and years Results
are presented graphically with interactions for each
maternal risk factor These plots do not present mortality
and previous teenage birth because of the low numbers
For unplanned admissions for injury and post discharge
infant mortality but not birthweight we excluded
mother baby pairs in which the baby would not have
been exposed to the mother after the birth episode ie
those discharged to social services or not surviving to
postnatal discharge appendix p
To quantify the risk of adverse outcomes for women with
each psychosocial risk factor we derived risk differences
from generalised linear models with a log link and relative
risks from generalised linear models with an identity link
comparing women with each risk factor to women without
that risk factor We derived adjusted estimates to help
understand how much of the associations were explained
by concurrent risk factors Adjusted models for birthweight
included all psychosocial risk factors defined previously
plus maternal age years
whereby the year age group combines the two year
groups because of the low numbers ethnicity and parity
Models for unplanned admission for injury counted
infants who had died from any cause after postnatal
discharge as having the outcome because death was a
competing risk for admission All models used robust
standard errors to allow for clustering of women within
hospitals On the basis of these adjusted models we
derived population attributable fractions PAFs to
quantify the percentage of outcomes in the study
population attributable to each risk factor
We used multiple imputation with chained equations
for missing values of birthweight gestational
age and deprivation O The imputation
models included birthweight gestational age quintile of
deprivation delivery by caesarean section pregnancy or
delivery and neonatal risk factors identified from ICD IO
codes appendix p ethnic group parity infant sex
maternal age and psychosocial risk factors previous
teenage motherhood history of adversity history of
mental health or behavioural conditions we used five
imputations A complete case analysis was done as a
sensitivity analysis In both analyses unknown or
missing ethnicity was treated as a separate category
Analyses were done in Stata
