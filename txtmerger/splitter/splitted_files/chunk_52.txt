Abstract

Background Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a complex process influenced by multiple personal
psychological and societal factors Traditionally the risk perception of healthcare professionals has been presented as
more objective and authoritative than that of pregnant women Doctors have been presented as more concerned with
biomedical risk than midwives Such dichotomies oversimplify and obscure the complexity of the process This study
examines pregnancy related risk perception in women and healthcare professionals and what women and professionals
believe about each other s risk perception
Methods A cross sectional survey of set in UK maternity services Participants were doctors working in obstetrics N
midwives N pregnant women N Participants were recruited in person from two hospitals Doctors
were also recruited online Participants completed a questionnaire measuring the degree of perceived risk in
various childbirth related scenarios and the extent to which they believed others agreed with them about the degree
of risk generally involved in childbirth Main outcome measures were the degree of risk perceived to the mother in
baby in pregnancy scenarios and beliefs about own perception of risk in comparison to their own group and other
groups
Results There were significant differences in total risk scores between pregnant women doctors and midwives in
perception of risk to the mother in scenarios Doctors most frequently rated risks lowest Total scores for
perceived risk to the baby were not significantly different There was substantial variation within each group There was
more agreement on the ranking of scenarios according to risk Each group believed doctors perceived most
risk whereas actually doctors most frequently rated risks lowest Each group incorrectly believed their peers
rated risk similarly to themselves
Conclusions Individuals cannot assume others share their perception of risk or that they make correct assessments
regarding others risk perception Further research should consider what factors are taken into account when making
risk assessments
Background
Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a
complex process based on multiple factors It is in
fluenced by factors pertaining to risk perception beyond
the subject of childbirth and pregnancy specific factors
Factors involved in general risk perception include the
degree of perceived control involved in undertaking the
risk activity the ways in which information about the

risk is presented and the degree of trust placed in the
source of the information Factors specific to preg
nant women include the extent to which women view
childbirth as benefitting from medical management and
common concerns for the wellbeing of their babies
The two main discourses within which childbirth can
be understood also each have different approaches to
risk The biomedical model regards birth as inherently
risky whereas the social model regards pregnancy
risk as a concept constructed from multiple cultural and
personal factors Risk in the biomedical model is
generally presented in terms of potential physiological

outcomes whereas the social model recognises a more
holistic definition encompassing potential threats to
psychological and social wellbeing In line with these
discourses views of maternity healthcare professionals
have often been presented in a polarised fashion typically
doctors are presented as supporting the medical model
and midwives the social model Doctors educa
tion has frequently focussed on birth as a biomechanical
process whereas midwives may consider it in more holistic
terms However presenting these approaches as
entrenched opposites oversimplifies the issue Such
dichotomous depictions overlook the fact all healthcare
professionals are likely to be aiming to provide high qual
ity healthcare and ensure positive outcomes and may
well move along the spectrum between approaches
Accounts of risk perception should also consider women s
perspectives In contemporary Western culture women s
understanding of birth has typically been portrayed as more
subjective and less well informed than that of professionals
However women s perception of risk often transcends
the medical and social models as they act from unique and
individual perspectives of their own circumstances The
portrayal of lay persons perceptions of risk in relation to
birth has also been simplified and polarised with profes
sional perceptions of risk often characterised as objective
and logical and lay assessments as more emotion based
Again such dichotomous terms obscure and oversim
plify the differences and similarities of risk perception
between lay and professional groups Perception of risk by
members of both groups will entail an assessment of numer
ical odds but also be contingent on personal experience
context and interactions with others
However research examining lay and medical risk per
ception does find differences A review of quantitative
risk perception research found little correlation between
perceptions held by healthcare professionals and of preg
nant women with regard to pregnancy and childbirth
Qualitative research has similarly shown differences
in the way professionals and women define concepts of
risk and safety However there is little research in
this area and existing studies have used different criteria
for assessing risk perception of professionals and women
making them difficult to compare and reinforcing the idea
the groups assess risk in different ways
The aim of this study is therefore to examine
pregnancy related risk perception in women and mater
nity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society using a unified assessment tool to enable direct
comparison and to examine what women and profes
sionals believe about each other s risk perception This
study will contribute to the understanding of risk per
ception and inform professionals seeking to understand
awareness of risk and improve communication with
pregnant women
Method
Design
We conducted a cross sectional study of risk perception
in regard to pregnancy and childbirth by administering a
questionnaire see Additional file to doctors midwives
and pregnant women
Participants
A sample of pregnant women midwives and doctors was
recruited from two NHS Trusts organisations providing
state funded healthcare and utilised by the majority of the
population in South East England Seventy eight pregnant
women were approached and completed ques
tionnaires Fifty nine midwives completed the question
naire of those approached Initial uptake of the
study was low among doctors n of those
approached so recruitment was extended for this group
The final sample for analyses was pregnant women
midwives and doctors Doctors and midwives were
comparable in terms of time since qualification doctors
mean time years SD range to years
midwives mean time years SD range month
to years t p The midwives worked
in obstetric units and community settings neither trust
involved in the study has a midwifery led unit
Inclusion criteria for healthcare professionals were a
recognised medical or midwifery qualification and cur
rently working as a doctor or midwife in a UK maternity
service This allowed for participation by junior doctors
not specialising in obstetrics but currently on an obstetric
placement Pregnant women had to be between and
weeks pregnant and aged or over to participate
Recruitment occurred between June and April
Participants were initially recruited through two
NHS trusts in South East England However difficulties
recruiting doctors to the study meant it was necessary to
extend recruitment to include any doctor practising
obstetrics in the UK These additional participants were
recruited via social media and completed the study
online
Pregnant women were approached by a researcher
while waiting for their mid pregnancy anomaly scan All
women in the UK are offered this scan so this time was
chosen to reach the maximum number of women They
were given verbal and written information about the
study and reassurance about confidentiality If they
agreed to participate they completed the questionnaire
straight away and returned it to the researcher Informa
tion about the study was placed in the maternity depart
ments for doctors and midwives along with copies of the
questionnaire for them to complete at their convenience
Researchers also visited the maternity units to provide
further information and approach staff in person Con
sent agreed as part of the ethics approval for the study

was considered indicated by completion of the question
naire All participants received information about the
study explaining the procedure
Measures
The questionnaire consisted of two elements The first
measured risk in relation to pregnancy and childbirth sce
narios items and was adapted from the work of Gray
a who used a similar scale to measure risk perception
in relation to hospitalisation in pregnancy Each item in the
first element briefly described a pregnancy or birth sce
nario e g a woman who has a minor postpartum haemor
rhage at home a woman giving birth in a birthpool in
hospital Participants were asked to rate how much risk
they perceived each scenario represented to the wellbeing
of i the mother and ii the fetus baby Participants were
provided with a definition of risk as a possible degree of
threat to physical or psychological wellbeing This defin
ition was intended to allow participants to formulate their
own interpretations of scenarios as far as possible Three
obstetricians three midwives and six pregnant women
assisted in the development and piloting of the question
naire to ensure user acceptability and face validity
All participants received the same questionnaire but the
version for pregnant women also included definitions of
medical terms e g shoulder dystocia pre eclampsia etc
taken from the NHS Choices or Royal College of Obstetri
cians and Gynaecologists websites Participants indicated
the degree of risk perceived using a visual analogue scale
a mm line representing a continuum from minimal
risk to extreme risk The distance from the beginning of
the scale to participants marks was measured and the
resulting millimetre measurement became the risk score
for each question minimum score O maximum score
Risks to mother and baby were scored separately
providing total possible risk scores of for risk to
mother and for risk to baby scenarios maximum
score per scenario
The second element looked at participants comparison
of their own perceived risk with other groups items
Participants were asked to compare the extent to which
they believed others agreed with them about the degree of
risk generally involved in pregnancy and birth A seven
point Likert scale was used ranging from they think it
is a lot less risky than I do to they think it is a lot
more risky than I do A score of therefore indicated they
believed the comparison group agreed with them about
the degree of risk Participants first compared themselves
with members of their own group other doctors mid
wives or pregnant women and then with the remaining
two groups
The primary outcomes were degree of perceived risk
and perception of own sense of risk in comparison to
others in their own group and other groups

detecting a medium effect size estimated a sample of
doctors midwives and pregnant women was needed
for the study to be adequately powered to find a difference
in the primary outcomes power significance
Doctors and midwives were also asked how long they
had held their medical or midwifery qualification
Analysis
Analysis was conducted using SPSS version
Kolmogorov Smirnov and Levene s tests were conducted
to test for normal distribution and homogeneity of vari
ance ANOVA was used to test for differences in total
scores between groups The data were found to be skewed
for scores on individual items so the non parametric
Kruskal Wallis test was used to test for differences between
the groups
Results
Doctors midwives and pregnant women s total mean
scores of overall perceived risk to the mother and baby
are shown in Table
Overall mean risk scores were low to moderate for
mother and baby ranging from from a
possible score of Doctors reported the lowest
mean scores There were significant differences between
groups for risk to the mother but not for risk to the
baby Post hoc tests revealed significant differences for

wives mean difference SE p and
doctors and pregnant women mean difference

nant women mean difference SE p
Across individual risk scenarios however there was little
agreement between the groups on the perceived degree of
risk see Additional file Regarding risk to the mother
scenarios showed significant differences between
the groups p and only showed no signifi
cant differences in risk scores p There was
also little agreement in scores on risk to the baby sce
narios showed a significant difference between the

slightly fewer scenarios highest mothers risk of

However although there was variation between groups
in the risk scores assigned to the mothers and babies in
the scenarios there were similarities across the groups
when the scenarios were ranked in order of degree of
perceived risk The highest ranking scenarios are
shown in Table for risk to mothers and Table for
risk to babies Six scenarios were consistently rated high

while there was frequent disagreement about the degree
of risk posed in each scenario there was more consensus
about the scenarios that posed the greatest risk to
mothers and babies
Mean scores for participants estimations of how their
peers and members of the other groups would rate risk in
comparison to their own ratings are displayed in Table
Each group believed their peers agreed with them about
the degree of risk generally involved in pregnancy and
childbirth Doctors believed midwives perceived birth as a

risky and pregnant women as a little less risky than they
did Pregnant women believed doctors agreed with them
about the degree of risk involved in pregnancy and birth
Their mean score for comparison with midwives fell
between midwives believing birth is a little less risky and
agreeing with the degree of risk

This study aimed to examine risk perception in relation
to pregnancy and childbirth in pregnant women and ma
ternity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society and to examine what pregnant women and pro
fessionals believe about the risk perceptions of each
other Results showed there were differences in risk per
ception in relation to pregnancy and birth within and
between pregnant women doctors and midwives When
rating risk of different scenarios to mothers there were
significant differences between pregnant women doctors
and midwives for out of pregnancy related scenar
iOS This was less marked when rating risks for babies
where overall mean risk scores were not significantly dif
ferent between groups but there were differences in the
scores of out of scenarios While assessments of
the degree of risk pertaining to scenarios differed there
was more agreement on the ranking of scenarios accord
ing to risk Interestingly when comparing their own rat
ings of risk to others each group incorrectly believed
their peers rated risk similarly to themselves These
beliefs were not supported by the first part of the study
The mean risk score for each group and in particular
the doctors had large standard deviations indicating a
wide range of scores within groups see Table Each
group also believed doctors perceived most risk in preg
nancy and birth However where there were significant
differences in scores for individual scenarios where doc
tors consistently rated the risks lower than women and
midwives in The results of this study are consistent with
previous research showing pregnant women think about
risk differently to healthcare professionals It showed
pregnant women had the highest risk perception scores

risk especially concerning the birth process and the
wellbeing of their babies While this may appear
concerning these fears are not necessarily perceived
negatively by women however and though common are
often not perceived as very intense or intrusive They
may be viewed as an integral part of pregnancy which
confers an element of protection by motivating women
to speak out about their concerns Thus while
women acknowledge pregnancy and birth may involve a
degree of risk they also utilise psychological strategies to
manage these concerns and may tolerate greater degrees
of risk than professionals recommend or would be pre
pared to tolerate for themselves if they believe doing so
will result in a better outcome for themselves and their
babies Within the professionals risk assess
ments midwives also rated risks to mothers significantly
higher than doctors While midwifery care is based on
the assumption and promotion of normality in preg
nancy much midwifery activity is focussed on concerns
regarding the abnormal so creating a degree of tension
and disjunction between rhetoric and practice
This study found differences between the risk percep
tion of pregnant women and healthcare professionals It
was beyond the scope of the study to investigate potential
reasons for these differences but they have traditionally
been attributed to women s more subjective less
knowledge based understanding of risk However
such a distinction may be misplaced emotion imagination
and intuition are components of all perceptions of risk
and so are likely to influence women and professionals
alike alongside an assessment of objective knowledge
Healthcare professionals have been shown to consider

the degree of the patient s anxiety their own clinical ex
perience particularly that based on borderline or espe
cially interesting cases and negative outcomes and the
opinions of trusted colleagues when making decisions re
garding risk They actively interpret evidence
based guidelines according to their own and the patient s
individual circumstances rather than follow them abso
lutely Rather than differentiating between lay subjective
inferior and professional objective authoritative under
standing of risk it may be more appropriate to acknow
ledge both groups rely on different types of understanding
systematic intuitive experiential and tacit when making
judgements about risk Further research is needed to
establish how maternity professionals combine subjective
and objective elements of risk perception It may also be
the case that doctors become habituated to situations in
volving greater degrees of risk as they make up the majority
of their practice and utilise their obstetric skills
The midwives and doctors in this study demonstrated
some differences in risk perception Perceived differences
in approach to risk have been shown to be a factor which
can lead to tension between maternity care professionals
and feelings of lack of trust and support Such tension
maybe interpreted as conflict by service users and cause
them some anxiety The members of each group in
this study believed their peers agreed with them about the
degree of risk involved in pregnancy and childbirth
although the results did not support this belief In all com
munication individuals typically overestimate the extent
to which others share their beliefs and interpretation of
events This false consensus effect is particularly
evident in situations deemed important in this instance

healthcare These factors can lead to misinterpreted com
munication and conflict so maternity care profes
sionals should be aware of their potential influence in
communication with members of their own discipline as
well as others and pregnant women
This study demonstrates risk perception in relation to
pregnancy and birth is a complex and individual process
It challenges the stereotypical depictions of doctors and
midwives in regard to their perception of risk This has
implications for how professionals perceive their own and
others roles and how they communicate with each other
and with women in their care Traditional distinctions
between the quality of professional and lay approaches to
risk oversimplify the process and may devalue women s
understanding of their circumstances and contribution to
their car Recognising all parties have a common goal
and speaking openly about factors influencing risk percep
tion may enhance relationships with women and col
leagues This in turn has been demonstrated to have
a positive effect on outcomes for women and babies
This is the first study to explore the risk perception of
doctors midwives and pregnant women using a compar
able measure It adds to the understanding of how the
different groups assess risk their beliefs about the risk per
ception of their peers and others and has implications
regarding communication within and between groups It
will contribute to the understanding of risk perception and
the conceptualisation of risk It will increase knowledge of
risk perception in different groups and their beliefs about
each other and challenge unhelpful stereotypes It will
inform professionals working in maternity care and seeking
to understand awareness of risk and improve communica
tion with pregnant women and provide information for
women utilising maternity care
Strengths of this study include using the same mea
sures for each group to allow direct comparisons of risk
perception across groups The study was developed with
input from maternity service users obstetricians and
midwives ensuring its credibility and acceptability The
sampling strategy ensured the inclusion of pregnant
women with different degrees and experiences of risk in
their own pregnancies and healthcare professionals
working in different areas of maternity care with varying
lengths of time qualified to provide a range of potential
perspectives on risk A limitation of the study was the dif
ficulty recruiting doctors and need to include participants
recruited online The final sample therefore included doc
tors from other areas so the group was potentially more
heterogeneous and self selected than were the groups of
pregnant women and midwives The relatively small num
bers of doctors and midwives who ultimately participated
in the study mean further work is needed to establish how
representative their perceptions of risk are and the extent
to which the findings are generalisable Although efforts
Page of
were made to ensure face validity the questionnaire has
not been formally validated so further work is needed to
establish the extent to which it accurately represents per
ception of risk and the extent to which these perceptions
manifest in behaviour Finally between group differences
were tested for all individual scenarios and multiple
comparisons increase the probability that some of the
significant findings occurred by chance It is therefore
important to replicate and extend this research
Conclusions
Assessment of risk is a complex activity comprised of
objective and subjective elements All individuals making
an assessment of risk will rely on these elements to dif
fering extents depending on the particular context Indi
viduals cannot assume others share their perception of
risk or that they make correct assessments regarding the
risk perception of others
Healthcare professionals should be aware of these con
siderations when communicating with pregnant women
and also with other professionals Communication with
women should include sensitive and respectful exploration
of their understanding and perception of risk and safety
and acknowledgement of any anxieties When communi
cating with members of their own discipline professionals
should not make assumptions that colleagues will share
their perceptions They should be mindful of the subject
ivity of their own risk assessments and factors which may
influence their perceptions rather than attempting to elim
inate or deny the effects of some of these influences They
should challenge their own and others stereotypical
assumptions about the perception of risk in other disci
plines and ensure interdisciplinary communication is
based on professional respect and genuine understanding
Further research is needed to consider what factors
professionals and pregnant women take into account
when making risk assessments in relation to pregnancy
and birth and how they use these factors to formulate
their assessments It should also examine which ele
ments of pregnancy and birth are perceived as most
risky what it is about them which causes concern and
the extent to which evidence exists to support these
perceptions Qualitative research should explore health
care professionals and pregnant women s understanding
and awareness of their perceptions of risk Research is
needed to establish how perception of risk influences
professionals communication with women the barriers
to effective risk communication and how this communi
cation can be improved Research into interprofessional
working should explore how stereotypical expectations
about the risk perception of other groups arise can
be challenged and communication between disciplines
improved

Overdose Risks and Prevention
Strategies for Pregnant Women in
New York City
Bethany Medley
Introduction
Like many countries around the world the United States is in the midst of an
overdose crisis Since an estimated people in the United States have
died of an overdose with the majority of those deaths involving opioids Center
for Disease Control and Prevention While men account for a greater num
ber of overdose fatalities the prevalence of overdose is increasing more rapidly
among women of reproductive age Mazure Fiellin Additionally preg
nant and parenting women are more susceptible to unique risk factors compared
to their male counterparts such as limited access to reproductive healthcare
stressful child welfare interventions and increased stigma within healthcare set
tings Although harm reduction services including overdose prevention emphasise
compassionate and evidence based approaches for mitigating drug related harm
these services services are rarely designed with the various needs of pregnant
and parenting women in mind Gender responsive harm reduction approaches
must take into account factors within the nexus of relevant social systems i e
the criminal justice system women s healthcare and the child welfare system
Developing harm reduction and overdose prevention strategies for women of
reproductive age who may experience pregnancy during their drug use trajectory
is a critical area of need that require collaborative efforts with those with lived
experience Using excerpts from interviews with three women who had experi
enced pregnancy and drug use in New York City this chapter seeks to highlight

the importance of inclusive gender responsive overdose prevention and shared
expertise from those with lived experience
Women Who Use Drugs as Overdose Responders
The widespread availability of naloxone the medication used to reverse an opioid
overdose is essential in curbing the current opioid overdose crisis Naloxone is
safe and has no potential for abuse so there is little to no risks in allowing non
medical personnel to administer the medication Burris Norland Edlin
Research shows that training and distribution of naloxone to individuals likely
to witness an overdose can significantly reduce overdose mortality Siegler et al
New York City has made laudable efforts to increase naloxone training
and distribution to relevant community based organisations in order to make this
available to those that need it the most people who use drugs One participant
shared her expertise as an overdose responder
I don t panic under pressure I m that person that remembers all
the steps you know I can delegate you know You call You
uh you know help me with um you know CPR if we have to
do it because we had to at that point She wasn t breathing So
compressions and breaths and all that It it s helpful when you
have the ability to recruit people into your situation And as long
as you re giving you know concise clear instructions people are
okay You know what I mean If you re like freaking out then it
can turn into a shit show pretty quickly
In New York City dispensed naloxone rescue kits to community
members via registered Opioid Overdose Prevention Programs New York City
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene A significant number of nalox
one rescue kits are dispensed to harm reduction settings Harm reduction settings
are designed to provide low threshold overdose prevention education to people in
the community actively using drugs Harm reduction programmes often operate
in a peer based non judgmental environment Harm reduction programmes also
known as syringe access programmes may also provide other drug user health
resources such as sterile drug consumption equipment fentanyl testing strips con
doms HIV and Hepatitis C testing or low threshold access to buprenorphine
All of the women interviewed were connected to harm reduction services in some
capacity as participants or employees
At the time of this publication drug consumption spaces also known as super
vised injection facilities were not allowed to operate legally in the United States As
a result public bathrooms have often been used as convenient locations for people
to inject drugs due to the privacy availability immediacy and resources i e water
lighting and flat surfaces Thus it is common for people to use drugs in busi
ness locations with private bathroom facilities Wolfson Stofko Bennett Elliott
Curtis Recognising the overdose risk in many neighbourhoods with high
rates of drug use within her community one participant took it upon herself to
educate local business owners on overdose prevention with the use of naloxone
Overdose Risks and Prevention Strategies for Pregnant Women
I ve talked to like McDonald s employers employees and um it s
important that they have it in case they stumble upon somebody in
their public bathroom and that you know that s clearly because of
the equipment on the floor or whatever suffering from an overdose
Like dude administer You can t hurt them You re not gonna make
a mistake Call administer and have somebody else help you
The psychological effects of responding to an overdose for women who use drugs
including the benefits and harms of such an experience are an under researched
topic in overdose prevention literature Participants reported a a feeling of personal
responsibility to respond to an overdose within their community Not only did their
fostered connections at harm reduction programmes provide a supportive social
environment and access to resources but their involvement also provided a benefit to
share overdose prevention education among their peers and community Taking on
the social role of responding to an overdose has shown to provide valuable empow
ering skill sets that include increasing the sense of self confidence and self esteem
Wagner et al At the same time certain negative psychological consequences
should be considered when examining the impact of being an overdose responder
among people who use drugs Research shows the risks of burnout and trauma
among community based responders is rarely considered in current programmatic
support Shearer Fleming Fowler Boyd Mcneil Reflecting on experiences
as community based overdose responders participants shared their thoughts
I don t want to lose a loved one I don t want to lose a best friend
I don t want to lose anybody even if it is a perfect stranger to
know that I could have done something and that I didn t
I ve always been a part of the user community And I feel that they
have user rights and that they should be supported in their use
They should be supported in any changes they want to make They
should be supported period They re human beings
Barriers to Care for Pregnant Women Who Use Drugs
My water broke on the bus
I feel like I m pissing myself but I m
not even peeing So I went to the doctor and they said You know
that you re five months pregnant And I was like What I m five
months pregnant
Sometimes these things just happen because you have like lesser
periods or no periods because of your usage Like it s hard to tell
when you re fucking pregnant to begin with And morning sick
ness and dope sickness resembles you know so you wind up being
many months pregnant when you finally figure it out You know
that s what happened to me every time
As the testimonies above illustrate unexpected pregnancies are common among
women who use opioids Heil et al Drug use especially consistent opioid use

may delay or stop menstrual cycles Additionally early pregnancy symptoms i e
vomiting cramping and nausea may be difficult for women who are depend
ent on opioids to differentiate from withdrawal symptoms Jones et al
Furthermore stigmatisation practices towards people who use drugs are common
in healthcare settings Corrigan Kuwabara O Shaughnessy Mendiola
Galetto Fingerhood While research is limited on the impacts of stigma in
healthcare settings among pregnant women who use drugs the participants inter
viewed for this chapter emphasised their experiences of being stigmatised as a lead
ing factor in preventing initial or continued engagement in care
They actually treated me like crap when I told them what my
problem was They didn t even want to help me they didn t want
to hear me All they cared about was
