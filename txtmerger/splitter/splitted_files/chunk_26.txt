ABSTRACT
Objective Somalia has high rates of maternal mortality fertility and pregnancy among young women Factors
contributing to this situation are a lack of knowledge regarding sexual and reproductive health early marriages
cultural norms and the unmet need for or use of contraceptives This study aimed to explore the perceptions of
family planning among young men and women with tertiary education in Mogadishu
Methods A purposeful and convenience strategy using snowballing was used to recruit participants Four focus
group discussions were held online with young women and men aged years old All participants were
studying at five different universities in Mogadishu and only one participant was married The data were
analysed using thematic analysis
Findings The findings showed that participants objected to the concept of family planning but supported the
concept of child spacing They highlighted that people of their generation with tertiary education practise child
spacing to combine careers with family life Although all the participants knew of the benefits of child spacing
they had different opinions on whether modern contraceptive methods were an option for them They were more
comfortable with traditional contraceptive methods and believed that the quality of the modern contraceptive
medicine available in the country was unreliable
Conclusiorr Our findings suggest that it is crucial not only to include young people in family planning awareness
initiatives and implementation but also to give them a voice to advocate family planning and start dialogues
within their own communities
While efforts have been made to improve the sexual and reproduc
tive health of young people globally studies continue to report high
fertility rates among young people living in Africa
In Somalia in
Sub Saharan Africa young people aged years old constitute
approximately of the total population
and high rates of fertility
and pregnancy have been reported among young women
The
maternal mortality rate in Somalia is also one of the highest in the world
with live births The latest Somali Health and De
mographic Survey
showed that the proportion of girls who begin
childbearing in their teenage years is rising Childbearing at a young age
has great consequences for women infant health and society
From
the health perspective early childbearing and a high fertility rate are
associated with maternal and neonatal mortality pregnancy related
complications low birth weight and psychological distress
From a
societal perspective the risks include high school drop out rates poor
socioeconomic outcomes and the generational transmission of marrying
children at a young age
Factors contributing to a high fertility rate
among young people are early marriages cultural norms a lack of
knowledge regarding sexual and reproductive health and the unmet
need for or use of contraceptives
For the last three decades Somalia has suffered from civil war
conflict and humanitarian crises which have led to fragility in the

healthcare system and poor access to essential healthcare services
particularly family planning services
Investing in family planning is
crucial to achieving the sustainable development goals SDGs
It
also contributes to improving maternal health reducing maternal
mortality and morbidity and enhancing gender equality and women s
Family planning further allows both women and
empowerment
men to access accurate information regarding which contraceptive
methods can support them in their reproductive preferences
The knowledge that modern contraceptive methods are effective in
family planning and preventing unintended pregnancies has been
widely transmitted in Sub Saharan Africa yet the uptake of these con
traceptive methods remains low which is a great concern for achieving
the SDGs
In Somalia only of married women use modern
contraceptive methods and only half of the women aged years
old have heard of these methods
This indicates a low level of
knowledge about contraceptive methods among young people living in
Somalia However the knowledge of contraceptive methods among
Somali women in Somalia increases by age and education
For
instance of women without education had knowledge of con
traceptive methods compared to of women with education
Evidence confirms that education and economic are important fac
tors for women s fertility rate and use of family planning
However sociocultural norms may counteract and contribute to
women s use of family planning and preferences for larger family sizes
In many Islamic countries including Somalia birth spacing is
permitted but limiting children as family planning is interpreted is
discouraged
Several studies have shown that Somali women prefer
to have many children to enhance their status in society However
a recent study of Somali men living in Sweden showed that these men re
evaluated the ideal family size when living in a context outside Somalia
although social pressure continued to be a factor in maintaining a large
family size
While other studies of Somali men living in Sub
Saharan Africa have also shown varying opinions about family size all
the studies confirmed that knowledge about modern contraception is
low
Given this context it is important to investigate young people s
perceptions of family planning and contraceptive methods to design
gender and culture responsive interventions
More particularly
young people with tertiary education as young people with tertiary
education had knowledge and use modern contraceptive methods
Therefore in this study we aim to explore perceptions of family
planning among young men and women with tertiary education and
living in Mogadishu
Methods
Design
The study employed a qualitative exploratory design using focus
group discussions FGDs An exploratory design is useful when little
knowledge exists on the phenomenon to be explored
FGDs were
chosen because they facilitate the exploration of a phenomenon from
different points of view
allowing the authors to examine how the
phenomenon of family planning is perceived collectively by young
women and men living in Mogadishu Somalia
Setting recruiment and participants
The study was carried out in Somalia s capital city Mogadishu
which is located in the Banadir region The city is highly urbanised with
approximately million inhabitants and is administratively divided
into districts A purposeful convenience sample of young men and
women living in Mogadishu was recruited to participate in FGDs The
inclusion criteria were that the participants were young men and women
under years old who lived in Mogadishu The first author recruited
participants using the snowballing method Information about the study
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
was posted on Facebook This strategy was due to the COVID pandemic
and difficulties recruiting participants from other settings such as mos
ques coffee shops or schools It is also estimated that of Somali
youth have access to smartphones and the internet
Potential par
ticipants who showed interest contacted the first author and those who
met the eligibility criteria were invited to information meetings and to
participate in an FGD if they agreed They were then encouraged to
invite peers to participate by coming to the information meeting or
contacting the first author In total participants showed an interest in
and received information about the study and were asked for their
consent to participate At the time of the FGDs two participants could
not attend due to bad internet connectivity and one participant could
not participate due to time constraints Therefore participants were
included in four FGDs
As shown in
females and nine males aged years
Table
participated in the FGDs This study did not aim to recruit university
students exclusively however the majority of the participants
were carrying out their undergraduate studies in medicine nursing
public health or management programmes at five different universities
in Mogadishu This might be due to the information about the study
being posted on Facebook but also those who have been recruited
through snowballing were invited by their peers who were studying at
the university In addition two participants had master s degrees in
public health and management and only one of the participants was
married
Data collection
The FGDs took place between July and September Due to the
Covid pandemic they were conducted online using the Zoom plat
form Four group discussions were held comprising one mixed FGD with
both women and men two FGDs with only women and one FGD with
only men The reason for having mixed and separate sex FGDs was to
explore whether different perceptions emerged in the different FGD
types Initially we aimed to have six FGDs however in our last two
FGDs we realised that no newer information had resulted from the
discussions and therefore decided to stop recruiting more participants
after the fourth FGD
The FGDs lasted h and were audio recorded with the partici
pants consent They were conducted in the Somali language by two
Somali speaking researchers one moderating the discussions and the
other observing the interactions between the participants and their
levels of engagement Both the moderator and observer also reflected on
the discussions Their notes during the FGDs and subsequent reflections
were used when analysing the data FGDs and were moderated by a
woman last author and observed by a man first author and FGDs
and were moderated by two men first author and third author The
moderators who conducted the FGDs are experienced in conducting
such discussions and qualitative studies See

planning Before use in the FGDs the vignette was presented to students
in a master s of public health programme in Somalia who provided
feedback on whether it would be culturally accepted by the participants
The vignette was then tested in the first FGD mixed sex As no revision
was made to the vignette or the follow up questions the data from the
first FGD were included in the analysis The FGDs started with the
moderator reading the vignette aloud see
and asking the
Table
participants to give their perceptions and thoughts about the scenario
specifically in relation to family planning The aim of using the vignette
was to give the discussion more depth and focus than it would if based
on the participants perceptions alone Structured follow up questions
were asked to draw out the participants own perceptions regarding
family planning and what they would have done differently from the
couples in the vignette see
Table
The interactions during the FGDs were highly positive and the
participants appeared excited to discuss the case scenario In all the
FGDs except one the participants discussed the topic so exten
sively that there was insufficient time to cover all aspects While the
participants did not always agree they seemed to respect each other s
ideas The topics on which the participants disagreed are discussed in
the results section
Data analysis
All audio recorded FGDs were transcribed verbatim in Somali and
analysed using inductive thematic analysis
First the transcripts
were read inductively several times by the first second and last authors
The data were then read critically to capture the ideas and concepts
expressed by the participants The first and last authors who coded the
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
data ANONYMISED discussed their reflections and the ideas and
concepts that had emerged with the second author ANONYMISED
Codes were then extracted from the text segments describing the par
ticipants perceptions of the phenomenon and translated into English
ANONYMISED then grouped the codes and text segments into pre
liminary themes which were discussed by all the authors Next the
themes were revised and some of the subthemes were merged into
themes All the themes reflected on the core concept of the participants
perceptions of family planning and child spacing
Ethical considerations
The study received ethical approval from the Ministry of Health and
Human Services at the Somali Federal Republic MOH HS DGO
June All the participants received oral information about
the nature of the study and were informed that their participation was
voluntary and that they could withdraw their consent at any time
without explanation All participants gave oral consent to participate
and to be audio recorded
Results
The thematic analysis resulted in the following four themes see
Table
The first the concept of child spacing is more accepted than family
planning reflects how participants wanted to define the family planning
concept and the differences in young people and their parents and
grandparents generations attitudes towards the topic The second the
decision of child spacing goes beyond the couple describes how child
spacing decisions are shared The third acceptability and availability of
child spacing methods explores the perceptions of the participants and
society regarding what methods to use for child spacing and the quality
of the products available in the country The fourth awareness of child
spacing methods describes the participants views on the importance of
increasing awareness in society and knowledge among healthcare pro
fessionals who advise and treat women All four themes were salient in
all the FGDs
The concept of child spacing is more accepted than family planning
Many of the participants reacted to the concept of family planning
during the FGDs They emphasised that in Somalia the concept of child
spacing is used and understood to be in keeping with Islamic beliefs All
the participants objected to the concept of family planning which is
understood to limit the number of children one can choose to have as
the quotes below demonstrate
I support their idea from the vignette of spacing their children But
limiting children is not what I support because only Allah knows how many
children they will have It is not something or a decision that comes from
them FGD with women RI
I don t agree with saying that I will have a certain number of children
because we are Muslims But I support spacing the children by at least three

Scenario
This is the story of newly married couple
Farah and Halima who are in their early
twenties A year ago they met at university
when senior medical students and nursing
students were undertaking their
community awareness training in refugee
camps outside Mogadishu They fell in love
and later married Halima wanted to
discuss with Farah whether they should
wait to have children because she wanted
to finish her degree in nursing Farah said
that he had a good job now as a doctor and
Halima didn t have to work because he
could support his family
After a long discussion Farah and Halima
agreed that they would have a child now
but then wait for three years before having
their second child so that Halima could go
back to her studies and gain some work
experience

years because it is an advantage for the child FGD with both women and
men
Both religion and culture were reported to influence the participants
perceptions of family planning The participants reasons for not
accepting family planning were related to their Islamic beliefs and how
society viewed family planning The participants agreed that child
spacing was permitted in Islam but that many people in their social
environment had misconceptions regarding child spacing According to
the participants some people still believed that child spacing was not
permitted in Islam
This issue of spacing children is not something new Allah already
mentioned it in the Koran But many people do not have enough knowledge of
the Koran FGD with men
Acceptance of child spacing is related to age and educational
level
The participants agreed that individuals acceptance of child spacing
was related to their age and educational level They perceived that
young people of their generation and their parents grandparents held
different views on the topic with the young people and more educated
recognising the benefits of child spacing for both the mother and the
child to a greater extent than their parents grandparent s generation
The participants considered that social norms encourage couples to have
more children and their parents grandparent s generation follows these
norms rather than listening to facts regarding the benefits of spacing
children They also expressed that society attributes greater value and
respect to couples with more children which in turn gives the couples
increased status in the family and society
Somali society prefers and gives status to families who have many chil
dren FGD with men
Young people in our age group between and years old decide to
space their children but in the older generation the ones who have only a few
children still have seven kids FGD with both women and men
Decision of child spacing goes beyond the couple
The participants perceived that the decision to space children is
complex as it may involve other family members Even if the decision
about child spacing is made mainly within the couple both partners
families engage in the decision whether invited to or not The families
particularly the mothers frequently try to persuade the couple not to
space their children
Your own parents will not even allow you to space children for two years
Also your husband s parents won t allow you either So there are many
challenges from your families They might say Are you crazy even if you
both the couple agree they the family interfere with your decisions FGD
with women
Although many participants emphasised that the couple should
decide for themselves they knew that this view differed from the social
norm Women in particular reported experiencing social pressure to
have numerous children and potentially facing consequences for spacing
children The participants stated that society stigmatises women who
cannot give birth or who have few children In such cases the woman s
husband s family might persuade him to marry another woman even if
he is happy with his wife The only time the family might accept the
decision to space children is when the mother undergoes a caesarean
section and a medical doctor advises against trying to have another child
too soon The family will respect the doctor s advice when it concerns
the mother s health
Society and parents accept child spacing when the health of the mother
is at risk such as a caesarean section and risk to her life FGD with both
women and men
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
Acceptability and availability of child spacing methods
Using contraceptives to combine career life and family life
The participants emphasised that the young people in their genera
tion want to combine careers with family life and therefore will often
consider using contraceptives for child spacing Although many partic
ipants preferred child spacing they did not consider it something that
couples would discuss before marriage The participants agreed that
child spacing would be beneficial for couples relationships as well as
the health of the mother and her child
The whole family benefits if child spacing is used both the mother s and
child s health The couple will get time together and they will have time for
their children FGD with women RI
Traditional methods are preferred for child spacing
Although all the participants accepted child spacing and knew of its
benefits they had different opinions on whether modern contraceptive
methods were an option for all people whether women or men Both
young men and women in the study supported traditional methods such
as breastfeeding and withdrawal which they thought could be much
safer and more socially acceptable than modern methods However in
the male FGD the participants emphasised condoms as a way of spacing
children
I support the use of condoms because it has several benefits Not only does
it protect you against getting pregnant but it also protects you from other
infectious diseases FGD with men
Some participants especially women disagreed that breastfeeding
could protect the mother from becoming pregnant again They observed
that some mothers might not exclusively breastfeed which could put
them at risk of becoming pregnant
A mother might not exclusively breastfeed and then she might get preg
nant after the days after birth She gets pregnant and the child she gave
birth to will not have good health as well as the one who is on the way Not
only that but she will also suffer a lot The mother is suffering the child she
gave birth to is suffering and the one she is carrying is also suffering all three
of them are suffering FGD with both women and men
Modern contraceptive methods are unreliable
Some participants viewed the risks of the side effects of modern
contraceptive methods as outweighing their benefits They also
perceived that the quality of modern contraceptive medicine available
in the country was unreliable which made people suspicious and fearful
of using it Some participants particularly women noted that people
who want good quality modern contraceptive medicine purchased it
outside the country
When living in Somalia it is bestfor us to use the traditional way because
modern contraceptives are not reliable We don t know their quality FGD
with women RI
People do not trust the modern contraceptives available in the country
They purchase them outside the country FGD with women
The participants had different perceptions about the availability of
modern contraceptive methods in Somalia Some knew that contracep
tives were available at maternal and child health centres or hospitals
but only for married women However one participant did not know
where to find contraceptives I don t know if one can get them from
hospitals or other places This is the first time I am hearing about modern
contraceptive methods FGD with women
Awareness of child spacing methods
The participants highlighted that increasing awareness in society and
among healthcare providers is important They expressed that society
needed to understand the benefits of child spacing for the family the
mother the child and the father They indicated that raising social
G Dahir et al
awareness contributes to their desire for child spacing
Before we talk about the availability of modern contraceptive methods we
need to talk about the understanding of child spacing in society This is where
we need to start FGD with men
You know that Somali people have a bad perception regarding child
spacing or family planning Making them understand its benefits will take
time FGD with men
Another participant emphasised that awareness about child spacing
is growing but it might take time for society to accept it
We have almost accepted child spacing Let s wait on family planning and
limiting children FGD with both women and men
Participants underscored that healthcare professionals have a re
sponsibility to raise this awareness However some participants who
had conducted internships at maternal and child health facilities felt that
healthcare providers did not have enough knowledge to provide
adequate information to mothers and society They highlighted the
importance of training healthcare providers in the benefits and conse
quences of family planning
To raise awareness we need experts who can do the job in a good and
sensitive way I would say that we don t have those yet The healthcare
professionals are not yet equipped with such knowledge FGD with
women
Discussion
This study revealed perceptions of family planning and contraceptive
use among young men and women living in Somalia This is the first
study on family planning with most unmarried young men and women
living in post conflict Somalia The most compelling finding in line with
other studies
is how participants related to the concept of
family planning Consistently throughout all the FGDs the participants
objected to the concept of family planning if it was to limit the number of
children However they all supported the concept of child spacing
Another interesting finding is the shift or transition regarding family size
in the Somali community particularly in relation to how young women
and men in this study discussed the topic They thought that their
generation with tertiary education was already practising child spacing
A recent study
that investigated trends in fertility in several
countries in Sub Saharan Africa confirmed that educational level is one
factor that decreases fertility rates and increases the use of family
planning A recent study
conducted in Ghana with university stu
dents reported that the majority of their participants had knowledge of
and practised family planning However in contrast with the Ghana
study our participants suggested both withdrawal as a method to avoid
pregnancy and child spacing
Even though the participants in our study accepted child spacing
they pointed to the challenges of Somali families interfering with cou
ples decisions to practice it These findings align with those of other
studies
that highlight the role of cultural norms in fertility
preference and family planning Sociocultural norms influence how so
ciety views family size preferences
if the couple s status in
society is measured by family size this may affect how the young men
and women perceive family planning The participants in our study
expressed desperation about how to shift perceptions in families and the
community as the decision to space children extends beyond the married
couple We hypothesise that healthcare providers in Somalia play a
crucial role in promoting awareness of sexual reproductive health in the
community particularly among young people At the same time as our
participants highlighted healthcare providers need further knowledge
to be able to take responsibility for raising awareness in the community
and among women Nevertheless to increase awareness and use of
family planning methods the concept of spacing should be used
instead of family planning
The participants in our study also highlighted the importance that
young men and women living in Somalia place on combining careers
with family life and their awareness of how child spacing could support
Sexual Reproductive Healthcare
this However they further underscored the unreliability and lack of
good quality contraception available in the country Accepting child
spacing does not necessarily translate to using it unless the modern
contraceptive is available
While health awareness about family
planning can be raised if contraceptive methods remain unavailable it
will be hard to decrease the fertility rate and achieve the SDGs in So
malia
Our findings also confirm the different layers needed to
achieve all the SDGs and that the importance of women s education
offering effective family planning interventions and the availability of
modern contraceptive methods are crucial
Strengths and limitations
This study has methodological strengths and limitations that need to
be addressed The credibility of the studies was ensured by conducting
FGDs with both women and men along with only women and only men
This arrangement allowed us to explore whether there were any
different views between the sexes concerning family planning While
mixed sex discussions are challenging to carry out in certain studies due
to gender sensitivity it is still important to examine different opinions
We also observed different perceptions from men who participated in
the mixed FGDs than from those who participated in the male only FGD
Male participants in the mixed FGD tended to agree with the female
participants in the group In contrast in the male only FGD FGD the
participants had other perceptions regarding family planning In FGDs
and both the moderator and note taker were male which may have
resulted in the female participants discussing less openly and largely
avoiding expressing their perceptions However they discussed and
reflected on the case scenario Conducting individual interviews might
have given us in depth knowledge of each participant s attitudes to
wards the phenomenon
Credibility was also assured by conducting the FGDs in the partici
pants native language which ensured that nuances and various
meanings of the language were captured without losing anything in
translation To ensure credibility and confirmability all the co authors
also conversed throughout the data collection analysis and interpreta
tion phases
Braun and Clarke
highlight the importance of researchers
reporting their reflexivity as researchers use their expertise to analyse
and construct the themes The research team consisted of two senior
researchers and two junior researchers all of whom work in the field of
health science While the research team had an insider perspective all
being scholars of Somali origin they also had outsider perspectives as
some of the team members are in the Somali diaspora For instance
using the term family planning in the vignette was a conscious choice
which led to discussion on whether the use of the concept of family
planning was acceptable or not for young men and women living in
Mogadishu The fact that the research team could navigate between
insider and outsider perspectives may contribute to increasing the val
idity and robustness of the findings
The main limitation is that all the participants had university level
tertiary education so the findings cannot be transferred to all young
people living in Somalia The participants in our study likely had some
knowledge of family planning as the majority of them study health
science which may have influenced their answers However the authors
aimed to reduce this bias by using a vignette posing one question at a
time to highlight the full context of the research topic avoiding leading
questions and verifying unclear responses by asking follow up questions
Another limitation is that in each FGD two or three participants
knew each other which may have led to participants having similar
perspectives and agreeing with the perceptions of others However the
aim of the FGDs was to capture general perceptions of family planning
by young Somalis living in Mogadishu rather than individual
perceptions
G Dahir et al
Conclusion
Our findings illustrate that young people with tertiary education in
Somalia support the concept of child spacing rather than family plan
ning However they have shifted their perceptions of having larger
families in comparison to their parents and grandparents generations
which according to the participants in our study is partly the result of
gaining tertiary education They also aim to combine career and family
life Although the participants in our study want to practice child
spacing social pressure may push them to some extent to continue in the
same family patterns as their parents and grandparents generation The
participants also highlighted the availability of good quality modern
contraceptives as challenging for the people living in post conflict So
malia If modern contraceptives are not available it becomes hard to
practice child spacing or implement any interventions related to family
planning Our findings suggest that including young people in raising
awareness about and implementing family planning is crucial as is
giving voice to young people to advocate family planning and start
dialogue within their own communities

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Inorganic arsenic iAs is a human toxicant to which populations may be exposed through consumption
of geogenically contaminated groundwater A growing body of experimental literature corroborates the
reproductive toxicity of iAs however the results of human studies are inconsistent Therefore we con
ducted a comprehensive review of epidemiologic studies focused on drinking water iAs exposure and
birth outcomes to assess the evidence for causality and to make recommendations for future study We
reviewed English language papers assessing birth weight gestational age and birth size Thirteen of
the studies were conducted among populations with frequent exposure to high level groundwater iAs
contamination pg L and five studies were conducted in areas without recognized contamination
Most studies comprised small samples and used cross sectional designs often with ecologic exposure
assessment strategies although several large prospective investigations and studies with individual level
measurements were also reported We conclude that the epidemiologic evidence for an increased
risk of low birth weight g is insufficient although there exists limited evidence for birth weight
decreases the evidence for increased preterm delivery is insufficient and there exists minimal
evidence for decreased birth size In further investigation of birth weight and size we recommend incor
poration of individual susceptibility measures using appropriate biomarkers with collection timed to
windows of vulnerability and speciated arsenic analysis as well as consideration of populations exposed
primarily to drinking water iAs contamination pg L Given the large potential public health impact
additional high quality epidemiologic studies are necessary to more definitively assess the risk
The extensive distribution of inorganic arsenic iAs in the
earth s crust leads to local and regional contamination of ground
drinking water supplies and widespread human exposure

fore our aim was to comprehensively assess the epidemiologic
literature published to date and to characterize the strength of the
evidence for causal associations between drinking water iAs expo
sure and birth outcomes We also provide recommendations for
future investigations to address existing data gaps
Methods
We searched the scholarly literature using SCOPUS a com
prehensive abstract and citation database of research literature
which indexes peer reviewed journals worldwide including
Medline http www info sciverse com scopus Our initial search
was limited to original human research articles published in the
English language through August To identify candi
date papers we used the keyword combinations arsenic AND
birth outcomes papers identified arsenic AND birth
weight papers identified arsenic AND birth size
papers identified arsenic AND reproductive outcomes
papers identified and arsenic AND newborn outcomes
papers identified We manually searched reference lists in selected
papers and also employed reference lists from review papers to
identify one additional publication Paper titles and abstracts were
reviewed and retained if arsenic exposure via drinking water and
birth weight gestational age and or birth size was a study hypoth
esis On January we updated the search to include two
papers in addition to papers retained from the initial search
For each study we abstracted and summarized the location
and population sampled epidemiologic design sample size expo
sure and outcome assessment strategies covariates considered and
the magnitude and precision of effect estimates These character
istics were used in a qualitative evaluation of each study and to
assess the impact of the reported results Larger prospective stud
ies and those using individual exposure assessment strategies were
afforded greater consideration than smaller cross sectional studies
and those using ecologic exposure assessment strategies Further
more the timing and nature of individual exposure assessment
strategies were considered We expressed study results as preva
lence proportion ratios PPR odds ratios OR or average change
per unit increase of exposure B and corresponding confidence
intervals CIS or P values as reported by the
