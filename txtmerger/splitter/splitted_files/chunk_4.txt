entially due to
weakened social protection while
showed the
Alexiou et al
disproportionate impact of funding cuts on life expectancy at birth in
more socially deprived areas of England Considering a sample of
countries at different levels of economic development Maruthappu et al
showed that reductions in government healthcare spending led
to increased child mortality with the impact being greater in
low income countries
This provides a consistent finding across Alexiou et al and
Maruthappu et al
that the adverse impact of austerity pro
grammes is greater in the context of greater socio economic deprivation
From a related perspective Kayode et al found that irregular and
insufficient funding and lack of sufficient monitoring and evaluation
were some of the biggest implementation challenges for policies to
strengthen maternal care
Final programme theory
Conditional cash transfer programmes especially with adequate
community participation and a strong nutritional component in LMICs
led to improved child growth and anthropometric outcomes and
reduced infant mortality through strengthened household financial se
curity and empowerment to access health services NATO policy in
strument domains treasure and treasure organisation
It was noted that cash transfer programmes were primarily studied in
an LMIC context as would be expected given their particular relevance
in this economic context Empowering people to access health services
M S Barnish et al
especially where the cash transfer programme has a strong nutritional
component was identified by studies focusing on CCTs as a mechanism
for the positive impact of cash transfer programme participation on
child growth and anthropometric outcomes as well as infant mortality
reduction This potential mechanism was reinforced by Rasella et al
which showed that an increased income as a result of a CCT
programme can improve access to food and health related services
facilitating a reduction in under mortality
Sanchez et al
further reinforces the value of CCTs for improving nutritional status
while
Grellety et al
emphasise strengthened financial security
for vulnerable households as a mechanism by which these gains may be
achieved Behaviour change may be another mechanism by which cash
transfer programmes achieve their benefit This is related to strength
ened financial security since this security may in turn enable people to
change their health related behaviours De Andrade et al found
that CCTs led to decreased leprosy incidence in individuals under
years old potentially through enhancing early detection and prompt
treatment of cases reducing transmission occurrence of disabilities and
negative social consequences due to leprosy while
Cluver et al
found that cash transfers can reduce HIV adolescence among adolescent
girls through reducing risk behaviours The importance of ensuring
adequate participation in cash transfer programmes was shown by a
study from Brazil Labrecque et al which showed a negative
association between conditional cash transfer CCT programme
participation and child length and weight for age in the context of low
participation rates in the CCT However it is important to note incon
sistent evidence for the benefit of CCT programmes with Lopez Arana
showing a positive impact on thinness but not the more
et al
prevalent outcome of stunting in Colombia Mascie Taylor et al
showed that a cash for work programme in Bangladesh improved
childhood nutritional status and associated anthropometric status
through facilitating greater household expenditure on food and conse
quent consumption of more protein rich food
Shaefer et al
considered the opposite direction of effect assessing the negative impact
of the decline of cash assistance in a US context in a state level analysis
from to It was found that the decline of cash assistance
increased household food insecurity and child homelessness among
those in state education with the reduction in financial means espe
cially for women with greater social deprivation and stagnation in
maternal employment identified as a potential mechanism
conducted a process evaluation of a combined
Gram et al
participatory women s group and unconditional cash transfer pro
gramme to improve low birth weight in rural Nepal and found that the
benefit was limited by women not spending the money in the intended
Randive et al showed that the impact of a cash incen
manner
tive programme in India was differential according to the level of area
deprivation leading to increased inequality despite improved maternal
health outcomes emphasising the need for more targeted interventions
Barber and Gertler and Perez Lu et al both emphasised
the importance of system co ordination for successful CCTs noting that
both treasure and organisation elements have an important role to play
Final programme theory
Health system strengthening including achieving greater integration
of maternal and child health programmes into the national health
agenda in LMICs led to reduced under and maternal mortality
through country level including economic growth and improved infra
structure health system factors including increased investment in
midwifery training increased funding for salaries and resources
increased facility births and increased skilled birth attendance and a
high level of acceptance by providers and patients NATO policy in
strument domain organisation treasure organisation
Kayode et al in a Ghanian context found that the benefit of
increasing and strengthening cost effective and neonatal specific in
terventions such as the Safe Motherhood Program SMP and
Community Based Health Planning and Services CHPS Program on
Social Science Medicine
under mortality in line with was achieved through high levels
of acceptance of the policies and interventions among health providers
and patients which improved utilisation rates Furthermore in
Pakistan
found that integrating newborn care in
Khan et al
national health policies and programmes facilitated reduced neonatal
mortality and identified the catalysation of newborn services at both
facility and community levels through the National Maternal Newborn
and Child Health Programme as a mechanism In turn this strength
ening of the integration of neonatal care into the national health agenda
has been facilitated by civil society and academic advocacy and advisory
links with the government In a Cambodian context
Liljestrand and
found that another health system strengthening
Sambath
initiative the Safe Motherhood Programme increasing the incorpora
tion of maternal health into the national health agenda facilitated a
reduction in maternal mortality Country level factors such as peace
and stability economic growth improved transport and communication
infrastructure and improved female education as well as health system
factors such as increased facility based births increased investment in
midwifery training and increased skilled birth attendance were iden
tified as potential mechanisms
In the context of health system capacity strengthening
Fernandes
et al
found a decrease in child mortality in Mozambique and
identified a combination of financial and structural institutional mech
anisms increased health workforce density increased institutional birth
coverage and increased governmental budgetary resources to support
salaries and other health facility running costs This shows how treasury
tools can augment positive child and maternal outcomes when operating
in the context of community participation and system wide reforms
Final programme theory
Focused maternal and child health interventions led to reduced
maternal perinatal infant and under mortality in LMICs through a
demographically responsive health system and improved sickness
management NATO policy instrument domain organisation
and
Okafor et al
Bang et al
in an LMIC context
found that focused maternal and neonatal care programmes led to
reduced perinatal and maternal mortality through improved sickness
management Meanwhile
found that favourable
Acuin et al
health system development related to obstetric care and interventions
directed towards infectious diseases predicted a rapid decline in
maternal infant and under mortality in an Asian context with modest
levels of economic growth The key mechanism of this effect was iden
tified as having a demographically responsive health system Compre
hensive district level health programmes in Laos including
strengthening of district health management and improving access to
health facilities led to increased healthcare utilisation at a population
level in turn facilitating a reduction in child and infant mortality rates
in a Brazilian context
Perks et al Aquino et al
corroborated the view that reorganisation of primary health care can
reduce infant mortality also noting a reduction of health inequalities
through a greater reduction in areas with higher baseline infant mor
tality In a Tanzanian context Armstrong Schellenberg et al also
found that a strategy to integrate the management of childhood illness
reduced under mortality and identified facilitating access to health
facilities and consequent high utilisation as potential mechanisms In a
Nigerian context Findley et al identified that participatory and
community based interventions in the context of an integrated
maternal newborn and child health program increased skilled birth
attendance and follow up and infant vaccination rates as well as reduced
infant mortality rates
specifically identified a
Findley et al
benefit from increasing participation However
Narwal and Gram
in an Indian context found no evidence for the benefit of the
National Rural Health Mission on infant mortality suggesting a need for
more robust monitoring and evaluation processes
Specifically in the context of a conditional cash transfer programme
intervention incorporating a lipid based nutrient supplement
Adubra
M S Barnish et al
et al
identified weakness in intervention design and suboptimal
implementation short duration and poor coverage as reasons for
negative effects on stunting Turning in particular to the role of com
munity health workers
Meghea et al
specifically in a US
context found no overall benefit on child health of the introduction of
community health workers whereas contrastingly
Abdulahi et al
found the introduction of community health workers to be an
important component of how the health system is organised for the
benefit of child health While it is not possible to know for certain this
discrepancy in outcomes may relate to differences in health systems
context Considering another nutrition based intervention the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women Infants and Children
in the United States found that the
WIC
Bitler and Currie
intervention was associated with improved birth outcomes with the ef
fect being greater among more disadvantaged women
Discussion
Summary
This article presents a realist review focusing on child and maternal
health incomes in relation to policy instruments It identifies several
theories relating to public expenditure austerity conditional cash
transfer programmes health system strengthening and focused maternal
and child health interventions Treasure and organisation were the most
consistently effective single policy instruments using the NATO model
Considering multiple instruments the combination of authority treasure
and treasure organisation was shown to be particularly synergistic The
effectiveness of particular instruments was shown to be context
dependent rather than context independent It was noted that nodality
did not feature among the best supported policy instruments in this
review It is not possible to determine whether this reflects a relative
ineffectiveness of nodality for child and maternal health a preference on
the part of governments to deploy other strategies and or a preference
by researchers and funders to study other policy instrument types
Contextualisation
This work builds on a prior realist review by Barnish et al
which also considered child and maternal health outcomes in the
context of a different but related set of political exposures democracy
political tradition the welfare state and globalisation As such the
specific programme theories are different but share some thematic
commonalities The current work excluded fertility outcomes to improve
the specificity of the results This is because the directionality of the
effect of fertility data depends on the baseline population density of the
study which will differ between countries included within a single study
as well as across studies Furthermore the present review also includes
studies that presented data from only one sovereign country whereas
the prior review only considered internationally comparative studies
Thirty eight of the included studies in the current work were interna
tionally comparative The addition of studies assessing a single country
offers a valuable perspective given the selection of policy instruments
can be influenced by a range of country specific factors The policy in
strument theoretical lens helps public health scholars to examine the
broader institutional apparatuses matter in affecting governance and
capacity in implementing mega health programmes and interventions
aiming to improve maternal and child health and how these forces result
in programmes and interventions being enforced or veered away from
the intended outcomes
The present review targets the final of the five key steps identified by
Berry and Saloner for the use of policy to generate substantial
population health benefits that is to say evaluating the effects of pol
icies Work by
Gelius et al
found that the selection of harder or
softer policy instruments depends on the outcomes sought The present
work found that harder policy instruments such as treasure based
Social Science Medicine
instruments were generally preferred in the context of child and
maternal health outcomes with softer instruments in particular
nodality based instruments not featuring among the most effective
strategies Policy instruments deployed for child and maternal health
had more in common with those deployed for tobacco and alcohol policy
rather than those for encouraging good nutrition and physical activity in
the general population
Gelius et al
The realist perspective generated micro theoretical initial pro
gramme theories which were iterated through multiple rounds of dis
cussion to adjudicate the proposed theories and to situate them in the
context of macro theoretical perspectives from the wider literature For
instance the cross fertilisation of public policy theories and public
health literature means that we could apply a policy instrument theo
retical lens from public policy to dissect public health interventions for
maternal and child health to achieve a system level understanding of
their implementation mechanisms as well as dissecting the explicit and
hidden factors within the entire health system governance structure that
affect the success and failure of these programmes interventions and
reforms
The present work shows different approaches that governments and
health system organisations have deployed as they seek to address the
international health priorities World Bank United Nations General
Assembly of child and maternal health in the context of the
practice of the art and science of administering states that constitutes
politics
Analysis was undertaken using
McLean and McMillan
the NATO model for policy instruments
Results may differ
Hood
if an alternative classification scheme were to be used but there are
broad commonalities
and
Pal
for example
Vedung
speak to the degree of use of state mechanisms and authority in
deploying policy instruments
notes that the choice of in
Pal
strument may depend on the extent of state coercion that will be
accepted as legitimate for this particular purpose which speaks to
purpose specific differences in policy instrument selection as noted by
The use of a more focused instrument such as NATO
Gelius et al
affords an advantage to the present work in drawing commonalities and
distinguishing context specific differences in instrument deployment
compared to an approach such as Kirschen which offers greater
granularity However with different types of policy instruments
identified it is less amenable to comparative analysis across contexts
Greater use of treasure and authority related instruments may be
generally more aligned with social democratic and or socialist macro
theoretical perspectives Bailey Lamb and Docherty
However this will depend on specific local cultural and political con
texts as well as factors related to health system organisation Further
more an international context introduces systematic and idiosyncratic
complexities in the mapping between political characteristics and spe
cific political parties Barnish et al
Strengths and limitations
This work benefits from the use of realist methodology drawing on
the theoretical lens of critical realism to offer an explanatory perspec
tive to inform considerations around the relationships between policy
instruments and child and maternal health The use of systematic
searching of seven major scholarly databases plus relevant supplemen
tary searches and independent dual review minimised the risk of non
retrieval and reviewer bias
Most studies were ecolog
Uman
ical which permitted studies to access larger more representative
datasets across longer time spans than would be typically untenable with
individual based methods such as cohort studies and randomised
controlled trials However the risk of ecological fallacy in extrapolating
group level effects to constituent individuals should be considered Most
studies were observational which poses challenges for drawing causal
inferences although a critical realist theoretical lens can help mitigate
this Only English language articles were able to be considered

Pregnancy as a Window of Opportunity for HIV Prevention
Effects of an HIV Intervention Delivered Within Prenatal Care

Young pregnant women are at high risk for
HIV and sexually transmitted infections STIs l
In a systematic review of sexual risk behavior
among pregnant or mothering adolescents
to had an STI during pregnancy and
to had an STI to months postpartum
Futhennore young pregnant women were
times less likely to use condoms compared with
nulliparous women
Despite the risks of STI and HIV infection
among women of reproductive age few HIV
interventions have specifically targeted preg
nant women The Children s Health and Re
sponsible Mothering project Project CHARM
a school based intervention of pregnant and
mothering adolescents found increases in
condom use intentions but no difference in
number of unprotected acts of sexual inter
course compared with a general health pro
motion control group Another study found
that pregnant women given a session HIV
intervention had moderate increases in knowl
edge and safer sexual behaviors that were
sustained months after the intervention
Although few studies of HIV and STI inter
ventions have targeted pregnant women some
have focused on women attending primary
care clinics Interventions for STI clinic pa
tients documented significant declines in STI
incidence However most HIV interventions
are limited because they do not integrate HIV
prevention with the provision of other ser
vices
and are not theory based
Pregnancy offers a unique opportunity for
intervention as it is a time when women engage
in high risk behaviors make behavioral
changes and have frequent contact with health
care professionals Finally

natal care can be sustained because care is
reimbursable by insurance
The bundling of HIV prevention with exist

According to intent to treat analyses women assigned to the HIV prevention
group intervention were significantly less likely to have repeat pregnancy at
months postpartum than individual care and attention matched controls they
demonstrated increased condom use and decreased unprotected sexual inter

Data Analytic Plan
Analyses were a series of random effects
regression analyses based on intention to treat
models with randomized condition as the pri
mary independent variable CPP CP and
Random effects allow the use of all
available data rather than excluding missing
data this allows intent to treat analyses to be
easily conducted
For each random effects
regression we treated the follow up assess
ment points as a random effect of control
ling for baseline scores We modeled a series of
planned comparisons that looked at differences
in follow up controlling for baseline scores for
CPP compared with the control groups com
bined e g CPP versus IC and CP For all
significant effects we conducted post hoc analy
ses to assess if the nature of the differences were
similar for each control group i e IC and CP
For continuous outcomes random effect regres
sions with general linear mixed models were
employed by using SAS PROC MIXED SAS
Institute Inc Cary NC For count data e g
number of unprotected sexual acts we
employed generalized linear mixed models that
used SAS PROC GLIMMIX SAS lnc
Cary NC For the count data we used a Poisson
distribution whereas for the binary data we used
a binomial distribution For the dichotomous
variable repeat pregnancy STIs we conducted
logistic regression analyses
In addition we assessed the possibility that
the intervention was more effective for key risk
subgroups Therefore we tested for possible
moderators race and age These potential
moderators were chosen because they have
been shown to be important predictors of STI
and HIV risk Interaction tests were assessed
and followed up with stratified analyses
RESULTS
Eighty percent of participants were African
American were Latina were White
and were mixed or other race ethnicity
The average age was years SD
were aged younger than years and
were aged years or older Forty eight
percent were nulliparous More than half of
participants had a history of an STI diagnosis
Biological Outcomes
As seen in Table rates of bacterial STIS
were highest months postpartum The rates
of chlamydia and gonorrhea were and

somewhat weaker results were found for

did not differ from controls on unprotected
sexual intercourse in the third trimester of

participants did have less unprotected sexual

To explore condom use motivations we
conducted post hoc analyses among condom
users Of those using condoms at months
postpartum there were no differences in the
reason for condom use between the CPP par
ticipants and the IC and CP controls P
Eighty six percent of participants reported they
used condoms for pregnancy prevention and
reported using them for STI protection

in CPP were more likely to report using con
doms for STI protection compared with the IC

There were no differences between groups on
use of condoms for pregnancy prevention at

Subgroup Analyses
Although we did not find differences on STI
incidence among the groups it is possible that
the intervention was stronger in some sub
groups than in others We tested potential
moderators race and age Because the major
ity of participants were African American we
compared the effectiveness of the intervention
for African American versus non African
American participants There were no

DISCUSSION
CenteringPregnancy Plus is different from
other HIV interventions because it seamlessly
RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
integrates HIV prevention into an existing
health care structure prenatal care By bun
dling HIV prevention services into existing
prenatal health care services we maximize the
reach and minimize the barriers to imple
menting the intervention broadly to at risk
populations Furthermore the additional time
needed for HIV prevention does not come at
the expense of prenatal care We have previ
ously shown that CPP and CP do not differ on
birth outcomes preterm labor low birth
weight prenatal care satisfaction prenatal
distress or initiation of breastfeeding
Participation in the CPP group reduced re
peat pregnancy at months postpartum by
compared with participants in the control
groups Repeat pregnancy for adolescents that
occurs shortly after index birth can increase
parenting stress and negative parenting be
haviors Therefore this reduction in repeat
pregnancy may significantly impact quality of life
of young mothers However it should be noted
that this effect was not sustained by months
postpartum indicating that booster sessions may
be needed to sustain these effects A possible
mechanism of this effect at months postpartum
CP CP
Adolescents y
may have been increased breastfeeding We
have shown in a previous study that the CPP
group had increased breastfeeding compared
with the IC group We conducted a post hoc
test including breastfeeding postpartum as a
potential mediator of the repeat pregnancy effect
results not shown The CPP group still signifi
cantly differed from controls with regard to
repeat pregnancy at months postpartum after
we controlled for breastfeeding Furthermore
breastfeeding did not significantly relate to re
peat pregnancy This suggests that breastfeeding
was not a mechanism of the influence of CPP on
repeat pregnancy at months
Participation in the CPP group had sustain
able effects on condom use The CPP partici
pants had more condom use and less unpro
tected sexual activity than did participants in
both the IC and the CP groups It should be
noted that these effects were primarily seen at
the postpartum follow ups Even though preg
nancy is a time women may make many
changes it may be harder for them to change
condom use behavior during pregnancy be
cause they are not trying to prevent pregnancy
