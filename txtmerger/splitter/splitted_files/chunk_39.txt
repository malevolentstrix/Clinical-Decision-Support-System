women with HRPs from July to December
in Mashhad Iran The participants were
selected using a purposeful sampling method of
the women referred to educational hospitals
participant and health centers participant in
Mashhad and the sampling continued until data
saturation The inclusion criteria were Iranian
women with HRP based on the obstetrician s
diagnosis and standard definition of HRP I
outpatient condition willingness to contribute to
their experience and ability to speak Persian and
communicate verbally to provide the researcher
with complete information The exclusion
criteria were congenital fetal abnormalities
during the pregnancy or unwillingness to
continue the study
The data were gathered through in depth
semi structured face to face interviews with
participants until data saturation The
interviews took place in a private and quiet
room in a hospital or healthcare center each
lasting from to minutes The interviews
were conducted by corresponding author
after obtaining informed written consent
Sampling continued until data saturation i e
no new data or new category was acquired
The interview started with general questions
such as
What was your experience of
pregnancy How do you feel during this
pregnancy What have you done during
this
Do you think these actions
are enough What else have you done
differently than other pregnant women
What else have you done to maintain this
pregnancy The interview continued then
with open questions Can you explain more
about the ways you have tried so far to save
this pregnancy and Which medical
recommendations are acceptable to you All
interviews were recorded after the permission
of the participants and obtaining their written
informed consent
The data were analyzed concurrently
with data collection using the conventional
content analysis method as described by Elo
and The analysis consists
of three phases preparing organizing and

reporting In the preparation phase the
researcher corresponding and first author
listened to all of the interviews transcribed
them verbatim and studied the text to gain
an in depth understanding immersion of
the data repeatedly The organization stage
included the selection of meaning units and
codes reduction and compression process of
similar codes appearance of subcategories
and finally the abstraction process to form the
main categories The final list of categories
was formulated with a joint effort by all the
research team members after multiple joint
meetings and agreed upon by all group
members The final stage consisted of
reporting the extracted categories
For data trustworthiness the Lincoln and
Guba method was assessed which
included the four criteria of credibility
dependability
transferability
and
confirmability To ensure the credibility
of the data the researcher thought about it
continuously engagement with the data
The coded texts were made available to
other members of the research team for
validation were also given to participants
and were asked to revise the researcher s
correct understanding of their experiences
member check re interview Data were
evaluated to ensure dependability constantly
To express the transferability information
such as demographic characteristics

methods researcher s observations and the
data analysis process were fully provided in
the present study To achieve confirmability
all stages of the study data collection
and data analysis were continuously
meticulously documented from beginning
to the end For data management the
MaxQDA software version was used
The present research was approved by the

RESULTS
A total of mothers with HRP aged to
years participated in the study The demographic
characteristics of the participants are listed in
Table Analysis of the interviews resulted
in extracted codes and after exclusion of
the duplicate codes a total of main codes
remained These codes were classified into nine
sub categories and three main categories as
shown in Table
l The Excitement of Emotion
l a Feeling Worry and Despair
Worry was the first emotion of most
mothers when facing the risks that they were
going to experience in their pregnancies
Expressing worry and despair depended on
the type of risk factor in mothers as chronic
diseases and the presence of several risk
factors concurrently The possibility of
infertility was a vague concern about the
family consequences added to the worries
about pregnancy
I kept telling myself that it s my problem
we can t have children so I have to bear it
Then I said that the people around me my
mother in law might say after a few years
why you don t have children PS
For some of the participants the problems
encountered in previous pregnancies were
repeated and resulted in poor pregnancy
outcomes the feeling of despair prevailed
over other emotions
Every time I tell myself this time my
pregnancy will be successful but as soon as
my bleeding starts again I tell myself that
I won t get pregnant again I can t do it
anymore how many more times will I have
to get pregnant and will it be futile P

l b Gladness in the Shadow of Hope and
Optimism
If controlling the risk was possible from the
doctor s point of view physicians permitted
the mothers to get pregnant despite the risk
These mothers tried to regain peace with hope
in God joy with positivity in pregnancy and
peace of mind with a healthy pregnancy
As soon as the doctor allowed me to
get pregnant it was enough for me I left
the gladness behind I believe that in
this pregnancy God got me that so far no
problem has happened so God will care for
me afterwards as well this gives me peace
l c Momentary Shocking and Excitement
If mothers hear stressful news they are
shocked Hearing about the possibility of
not getting pregnant or the threat to the
health of the fetus such as the possibility of
abnormality abortion or death of the fetus
without any background they immediately
had a quick shock reaction
When the doctor said that I can t get
pregnant with myoma and uterine surgery
and they might remove the uterus I just cried
It wasn t my fault I just cried out loud
IJCBNM January Vol No
I d Inactivity and Helplessness
Mothers with chronic diseases and
frequent history of poor outcomes in previous
pregnancies needed more treatments costs
and were exposed to more drug side effects
These repeatable and boring measurements
caused the feeling of fatigue and helplessness
with pregnancy so they did not do anything
else due to the feeling of helplessness in some
stages of treatment
I have to take an injection every day
my body gets hives No matter what I do
the itching doesn t go away it bothers me
I couldn t find the drug sometimes It s very
expensive and now it s still five months
I m really wearied Sometimes I don t do
anything anymore P
Self contemplation
a Active Analysis of the Ways of Moderating
the Risk
Some participants thought about the risk
adjustment methods for themselves Each
mother evaluated the solutions according to
the ability in her personal and family life
My biggest worry is during childbirth I
thought to myself if I can take someone with
me as a companion if I have a caesarean
Khadivzadeh T Shojaeian Z Sahebi A
section if I give birth to my baby painlessly
or whether I can go to the city where I work
where they will know me more
Some mothers used to bear the problems
more easily hoping for the future of pregnancy
and imagining the joys of the child in the
future as one strategy
When my asthma bothers me I think I
will start planning for happiness and a new
life right now and not to be boring for myself
and my husband P II
Some mothers were investigating possible
alternative solutions to reach the desired
number of children
Until now no one told me that I could use
a surrogate I said to myself when I can get
pregnant myself why a surrogate
will definitely look for other methods P
b Cognitive Denial
Some mothers did not believe in the
importance of the risk In their opinion there
was no difference between them and the other
mothers compared themselves with other low
risk mothers They did not need to take more
care
I do the same things as other mothers
who get pregnant I go to the doctor I do the
tests I don t need to do anything else P l
c Ignoring the Risk
Some mothers desired to continue
childbearing despite the risk they comforted
themselves and tried to reduce the risk in their
minds to help themselves and then take action
When I m very worried I say to myself
that there are many pregnant women whose
conditions are much worse than me For
example one of them had had six cesarean
sections so far and nothing happened so
there will be no problem for me either I know
everything myself and should be careful
Some mothers believed that childbearing
was the only way to achieve what they wanted
and there was no other way for them they felt
compelled to get pregnant despite the risk
Therefore the risk does not matter against
the desire
If I hadn t been get pregnant I wouldn t
have been able to do anything else with my
life instead of having a baby My husband
wanted a child and being bothered during
pregnancy is not very important for saving
my life P
Witnessed Action
a Problem focused and Rational Actions
Mothers showed various actions in
encountering to HRPs The practical solution
for many mothers was to try all possible
solutions as using peer experiences relevant
support and alternative solutions Every
mother chose the method that was possible
and effective for her and tried to make it easier
for herself to bear the risk and problems
Before I got pregnant I read a lot about
the pregnancies of other mothers with my
conditions I traveled to another city to be
cared by good specialist doctors This way I
see other mothers in my conditions who got
pregnant and I can ask what they did
Some mothers tolerated the problems
obeyed medical advice and tried to reduce
the risk with methods spiritual solutions
patience family involvement and flexibility
According to their discretion they moderated
the risk and ultimately trusted in God and
were not dissatisfied
I did everything I couldfor this pregnancy
I went to the doctor I did all the screening
tests they said I put my trust in God I prayed
I read the Qur an for her health and thanked
God that it has progressed this far God is
great
Getting pregnant for some mothers such
as heart patients or chronic diseases was
associated with more problems than other
mothers It was to preserve the health of the
fetus and mother In this way they accept
all kinds of hardships and difficulties with
all their soul The health of the fetus was a
priority for these mothers
I didn t have a child no matter what
the doctor recommended I still refused and
became pregnant It is important for me to
keep the child I try to use everything I can
ijcbnm sums ac ir
to reduce my stress I cope with illness and
conditions everyway I take medicine
Ifollow a diet just to give birth to a healthy
child
b Avoidance and Inefficient Engagements
In addition to the thought of ignorance
of the risk some mothers showed avoidance
behavior and inefficient engagements in their
actions They consciously knew that they
should not get pregnant They did not take any
measures to assess the risk before pregnancy
They justified the risk of pregnancy to factors
other than medical issues or avoided going
to the doctor out of fear they did not take
preventive measures
If I wanted to wait for the doctors to give
me permission to get pregnant I didn t know
how long it would take and then they might
say no you shouldn t get pregnant that s why
I didn t go to the doctor before I got pregnant
Even now that I m pregnant when I go to the
doctor I don t ask anything
Some mothers consciously resisted medical
advice advice not to get pregnant They put
the doctor against the fait accompli and got
pregnant They justified that the appropriate
time to have a child with their living conditions
was now or decided to continue childbearing
regardless of the risk until they have desired
number of children
I didn t ask the doctor before I got
pregnant Then I told my doctor my baby is
already big it was time to have another child
and I am pregnant now
DISCUSSION
The main aim of this study was to explain
high risk pregnant mothers experiences from
risk management The results showed that
the mother s feeling was more prominent as
the most significant element of measuring
behavior after being informed about the risks
of pregnancy Mothers who had a poor history
of a previous pregnancy or chronic diseases
such as heart disease or pregnancy with several
risk factors felt more worried and disappointed
IJCBNM January Vol No
Risk management in high risk pregnancy
because they felt more at risk On the other
hand in mothers whose risk factor was less
severe such as age or the risk of pregnancy was
controllable from the mother s point of view at
the same time as worry feelings of happiness
and optimism were more expressed in the
mother The results of another study showed
that pregnancy along with having an unhealthy
and high risk body in diabetic women brought
a sense of lack of control which led to the
feeling of worry and guilt about high blood
glucose levels constant pressure and difficult
interactions with health care professionals
In a systematic review high risk mothers
experienced a wide range of emotions Their
behavior influenced expectations social norms
pregnancy complications fetal abnormalities
and pregnancy related diseases Therefore
shock fear despair sadness isolation and
loneliness anger sadness guilt and mental
health disorders were commonly seen in these
mothers In another study mothers experienced
emotions such as fear anxiety and sadness with
happiness in a HRP Another systematic review
found that the increase or decrease in maternal
happiness during pregnancy was influenced by
factors such as age life with a sexual partner
social support previous pregnancy experience
desired pregnancy and health status
In the present study mothers started self
evaluation after the initial stages of facing
the problem and subsiding the physiological
reactions According to the mothers
perception of personal capabilities and risk
control the thoughts were in the direction
of strengthening positive feelings or denying
the risk and avoiding responsibility Thoughts
of mothers who had a feeling of peace and
hope were in the direction of reducing the
effects of the risk Mothers who felt worried
and helpless blamed themselves and focused
on the obstacles by denying the responsibility
of managing the risk In one study high risk
mothers who had a sense of self efficacy
positively searched for information and in
stressful situations used individual approaches
such as control avoidance and distraction to
stressful information
Khadivzadeh T Shojaeian Z Sahebi A
Our results showed that the next step after
the targeted imagination to overcome the risk
was managing and practical determination of
effective and ineffective behaviors Therefore
the mothers behaviors problem oriented
strategies versus avoidance strategies
were included Actions were being patient
seeking support from relevant trusting
in God and imams controlling stressors
versus shirking responsibility refusing to
take preventive measures and trying to get
pregnant without paying attention to the risk
factor The methods or strategies a person
uses to overcome stressful situations play an
important role in his her mental health In a
study difference in behavior during pregnancy
was caused by differences in cultures In
another study literacy income and education
were efficient on health behavior Strategies
used by women with phenylketonuria in
one study included seeking knowledge and
support learning skills coping strategies
with evaluation and reassuring to minimize
harm to the fetus In one study the mothers
choices depended on perceived risk severity
judgment and beliefs about risks of pregnancy
and childbirth mother s weighting of various
influencing factors and prioritizing and
balancing the risk factors The interpretation
of safety and risk was different in mothers
who chose home birth or hospital birth but
the goal of both groups was the health and
well being of the fetus In a review studyr
researchers found that the behavior of mothers
during pregnancy was influenced by values
beliefs perceived risk priorities and different
capabilities the way to collect information
and examine them The main theme of all
mothers behaviors during pregnancy was
maternal and fetal health All mothers were
trying to fulfill the pregnancy in a way that
would ensure maternal and fetal health and
that care and problems during pregnancy
would not prevent them from satisfying other
personal and family needs
As a limitation of this study the purposeful
sample method and enrolment of volunteered
participants might have been a selection
bias Another limitation was that the care
providers did not participate in the study
The strengths of this study are the use of a
qualitative approach and that the study is the
first to explore Iranian pregnant women s
experiences of risk management during a
HRP We recruited the participants with
maximum variation sampling e g mothers
with different risk factors throughout
pregnancy
CONCLUSION
Risk management experiences of pregnant
women within HRPs include a wide range of
positive and negative feelings effective and
ineffective thoughts and behaviors ofthe mother
Mothers who faced several risk factors or chronic
diseases during pregnancy felt helpless focused
on the obstacles to having a healthy child and
avoided responsibility and effective behaviors
On the other hand tirelessness and efforts to use
all possible solutions and risk management to
achieve the goals were the characteristics of the
mothers who with positive thinking and belief
in the ability to manage risk and using available
resources tried to bring their pregnancy to
fruition despite the risk The pregnant mothers
desire to choose the best approach for both the
child s health and their well being is based
on their assessment of the pregnancy risks
Mutual collaboration between mothers and
midwives obstetricians can lead to choosing
effective risk management strategies Further
studies on midwives and obstetricians about risk
management in pregnancy are recommended

Abstract
Background Computerized clinical decision support CDSS digital information systems designed to improve
clinical decision making by providers is a promising tool for improving quality of care This study aims to
understand the uptake of ASMAN application defined as completeness of electronic case sheets the role of CDSS
in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery outcomes
Methods We have conducted secondary analysis of program data government data collected from public
facilities across four districts each in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan The data collected between
August October baseline and the data collected between December March latest was
analysed The data sources included digitized labour room registers case sheets referral and discharge summary
forms observation checklist and complication format Descriptive univariate and multivariate and interrupted time
series regression analyses were conducted
Results The completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period and in facilities with
more than deliveries a month In multivariate logistic regression analysis the introduction of technology
yielded significant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices We have observed reduction in fresh still
births rates and asphyxia but these results were not statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
However our analysis showed that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of
program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased
Conclusions Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care and delivery
outcome Future studies with rigorous study design is required to understand the impact of technology in
improving quality of maternity care

Introduction
Globally it has been proven that effective and quality of
care at the facility level particularly around childbirth
and immediately after the birth can significantly con
tribute to the reduction of maternal deaths stillbirths
and neonatal deaths Over the last decades efforts
in ensuring skilled birth attendance resulted in increased
institutional deliveries this in turn moved higher pro
portion of avoidable maternal and neonatal mortality to
health facilities Therefore improving quality of care
around childbirth and immediately after birth is impera
tive to prevent adverse outcomes for pregnant women
and new borns
In India despite a tremendous increase in rate of insti
tutional deliveries maternal and neonatal deaths did
not show equivalent reduction in the last decade It
was found by few studies that the increase in the rate of
institutional deliveries was not matched with overall im
provement in quality of maternity care Quality of
care is a multi dimensional concept that incudes avail
ability of evidence based guidelines strengthened infra
structure resources enabling environment attitude of
health providers all these in turn result in patients and
providers satisfaction and improved health outcomes
To address these issues the Government of India
Gol launched the quality improvement initiative under
the name Dakshata means adroitness to build pro
vider adherence to key evidence based clinical practices
during intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods
Dakshata uses the World Health Organization s Safe
Childbirth Checklist SCC as a framework for
improving providers competency Although Dakshata
intervention has not been evaluated other quality of
intrapartum care improvement initiatives using SCC in
Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka
demonstrated significant improvement in adherence to
evidence based clinical practices Moreover a study from
Rajasthan showed reduction in perinatal mortality
which fell by However these studies detected
certain clinical practices that either did not improve sig
nificantly initiation of partograph counselling on dan
ger signs or declined over months period use of
SCC administration of oxytocin soon after delivery
Thus it is imperative to identify and test innovative so
lutions for improving quality of care in order to acceler
ate reduction in maternal and neonatal death in India
One such solution is computerized clinical decision sup
port CDSS digital information systems designed to
improve clinical decision making by providers a prom
ising tool for improving quality of care by improving ad
herence to clinical guidelines practitioner s
performance patient outcomes and
quality of clinical documentation thus contributing
to quality improvement and overall efficiency of health
Page of
care delivery While there is significant research on
CDSSs generally but evidence of use of CDSS for mater
nity care is limited In rural health facilities in Burkina
Faso Ghana and Tanzania CDSS was not found to sig
nificantly improve quality of antenatal and delivery care
A study conducted in South Africa showed that
CDSS lead to overall improvement in adherence to clin
ical guidelines but it was not statistically significant
In Nigeria McNabb et al reported that decision support
via mobile phones led to significant improvement in
health counselling technical services quality of health
education and patient satisfaction
ASMAN intervention
In this paper we describe the findings from implementa
tion of ASMAN The Alliance for Saving Mothers and
Newborns a provider focused package of interventions
that leverages technology to reduce maternal and early
neonatal mortality through the adoption of key tech
nologies that improve capacity building and service de
livery efforts focused on the provision of quality care
during childbirth and the first h after delivery
The ASMAN project takes an integrated quality im
provement approach
Competency building through provision of
training for Medical Officers MOs Staff Nurses
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife ANM on clinical skills
and quality of care as per the established labour
room protocols and standards For this purpose the
project adopted Gol approved Dakshata training
package for building the capacity of service
providers Post training follow up and on site men
toring were conducted by the program team to en
sure translation of skills into practice
Introduction of technology intervention to facilitate
timely and correct clinical decision making by pro
viders For this purpose ASMAN an android based
application for electronic recording of intrapartum
and immediate postpartum care integrated with
Clinical Decision Support e partograph knowledge
enhancement and other features was introduced at
project sites The ASMAN application runs on a
tablet stationed in several important areas of the
health facilities including registration triage the
labor room postpartum areas operation theatre
and post operative wards
The ASMAN application had the following
components
Case management Digitized case sheet from
admission until discharge with integrated clinical
rules admission notes e partogram Safe Childbirth

remote support center have access to all cases
ASMAN program implementation took place across
public facilities in four districts each in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh states of India The key stakeholders of
ASMAN were Governments of Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan This project was piloted between June
to May with support from Reliance Foundation
Tata Trusts MSD for Mothers Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and United States Agency for International
Development USAID Jhpiego was the lead implemen
tation agency The respective state governments were
consulted to select specific intervention districts that
had higher neonatal and maternal mortality rates as
compared to the state average districts without ongoing
intervention for improving quality of intrapartum and
postpartum care Within those districts government
health facilities that had a relatively high case load of
or more deliveries per month and therefore greater need
for intervention were selected
This program implementation offered an opportunity
to evaluate the role of a CDSS in improving quality of
care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum
periods assess its impact on delivery outcomes identifi
cation and referral of key maternal and neonatal compli
cations in selected public facilities
Methodology
Research aims
To our knowledge no studies from India have described
the impact of CDSS on clinical outcomes during the
intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods Along
with the lack of evidence on effect of CDSS in improving
quality of maternity care this gap represents a crucial
Page of
research priority for India with global relevance
Through this analysis we attempt to answer the follow
ing questions
What was the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers
How did the ASMAN application affect adherence
to key clinical practices
What was the trend of maternal pre eclampsia
eclampsia postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal
fresh still births birth asphyxia complications
during the project implementation
What was the trend of identification and referral of
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
postpartum haemorrhage during the project
implementation
Study design and study setting
We have conducted secondary analysis of program data
government data collected from public facilities
across four districts each in two states of Madhya
Pradesh Jabalpur Khargone Ratlam and Vidisha and
Rajasthan Ajmer Bhilwara Kota and Jhalawar This
de identified dataset was provided by the government of
both states The data collected between August Octo
ber was considered as a baseline and the data
collected between December March was
considered as a latest assessment The study was per
formed in accordance with ethical principles outlined in
the World Medical Association W MA Declaration of
Helsinki where privacy and confidentiality of per
sonal information was assured by getting access to de
identified data
Study tools and data collection
The following tools were used to collect data
ASMAN application data has digitized all labour
room registers case sheets referral and discharge
summary forms of Government of India Every
woman who comes to any ASMAN facility for
delivery is registered in the application All forms
are filled by the health providers at the project
facilities in real time Details from patient history
labour room case sheets partograph until
discharge is collected in the ASMAN application
We have used data from ASMAN application to
understand filling ratio at admission delivery
post delivery postnatal care PNC and discharge
Data of all those women who had delivered at
ASMAN facilities and their newborns between
November and March in Rajasthan
and Madhya Pradesh states are used for this ana
lysis Till March data of women
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
who delivered and newborns were en
tered in ASMAN application
The observation checklist was developed based on
WHO SCC and was approved by GOI as part of
monitoring activities under Dakshata program
This checklist was designed to measure adherence
to essential practices around childbirth These
practices were divided by pause points practices
that are necessary to perform on admission just
before pushing or before caesarean soon after
birth h and before discharge This tool was used
to explore adherence to practices at the baseline and
latest assessment periods The program officers
with medical background collected this information
the observation assessment on average took h
Complication format Maternal and New Born
Complications Identification and Referral
Monitoring System Since there is no formal
mechanism in the government systems to monitor
childbirth and new born related complication and
management complication format was introduced
by ASMAN program team with the support from
the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
The complication reporting format captured data on
key maternal and newborn health indicators from
the labour room postpartum ward Sick Newborn
Care Unit SNCU admissions and discharge
department of the facility This format captured data
on total deliveries type of deliveries fresh stillbirths
preterm births maternal and neonatal death
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
sepsis postpartum haemorrhage sepsis neonatal
complications neonatal asphyxia and sepsis refer
in and refer out data for maternal and neonatal
complications One nodal person preferably a
labour room staff was selected from each
intervention facility to act as the key contact person
for this initiative and was validated regularly by
ASMAN program team This tool was used to
explore effect of ASMAN application on delivery
outcomes
Data analysis
To describe uptake of ASMAN application we com
puted the filling rates of key data fields of the applica
tion and analysed the differences by pause points level
of health facility and average annual delivery load at the
health facilities
To analyze the change in adherence to evidence based
practices after roll out of the intervention we combined
the baseline assessment and last periodic assessment
data sets For overall univariate analysis of adherence to
key clinical practices before and after comparison we
computed means for before and latest intervention
Page of
periods and compared them using chi square test For
adherence to evidence based practices we also per
formed multivariable logistic regression analysis for each
practice while adjusting for level of facility average de
livery load at the facility and availability of resources re
quired for each key practice
To analyze trends in maternal and neonatal complica
tions and referrals we utilized the monthly complication
format data which was shared by all ASMAN interven
tion facilities As the intervention was rolled out in a
staggered manner at different time points across project
health facilities we categorized the complication data of
each facility into two time periods corresponding to be
fore and after intervention roll out
Within each time period we further grouped monthly
data into quarterly data months data such that each
quarter represented a time interval relative to the inter
vention roll out For example Q and Q denoted
the periods corresponding to months before and
months after intervention rollout respectively The
month of intervention roll out together with subsequent
months were denoted as QO or quarter O or the time
interval corresponding to intervention roll out Data of
corresponding quarters was combined for all facilities
and this dataset was used for generating simple time
series plots line bar for analysing the trends before and
after intervention roll out
Single group interrupted time series regression analysis
was performed on two dependent variables fresh still
birth rate and incidence of neonatal asphyxia We
have conducted interrupted time series analysis for these
two outcomes as these were primary outcomes of the
intervention Monthly data was utilized for carrying out
this analysis yielding data for time points before and
after intervention roll out respectively M to M
before roll out and M to M after roll out Coef
ficients or parameters which represented a shift in the
level intercept of the dependent variable and a shift in
the rate of change slope of dependent variable after
intervention were computed along with confidence
intervals Newey west standard errors were utilized to
account for autocorrelation
For all statistical tests of significance p value
was considered significant We used Statistics package
for the Social Sciences SPSS version Stata version
and Microsoft Excel for data analysis
