a lot of attention globally According to a recent
concept analysis women s perceptions about risk during pregnancy have an impact on their decision making during
pregnancy and childbirth Pregnancy related risk perception is a complicated topic because it affects both the mother
and the fetus Because even well intentioned measures may not be successful without this understanding prenatal care
professionals must be aware of how women perceive risk
Unexpected events that happen to pregnant women during pregnancy labor childbirth or postpartum are known as
obstetric danger indicators Among the most frequently observed obstetric danger symptoms include impaired vision
the absence of fetal movements vaginal bleeding a gush of fluid from the vagina high temperature foul smelling
vaginal discharge convulsions abdominal pain and severe headaches More than of maternal mortality in
developing nations are caused by pregnancy related conditions which are preventable
Maternal health promotion
and education for women men and community members to enhance awareness about obstetric danger signs are effective
measures that can prevent birth related complications Henceforth the World Health Organization WHO suggests
educating all pregnant women about obstetric danger signs at each prenatal visit Doing so will enable early detection
of obstetric danger signs and facilitate appropriate emergency obstetric care
Numerous studies revealed that the level of knowledge of obstetric danger signs was low in sub Saharan Africa and
Asia even though recognizing and understanding them plays an important role in reducing both maternal and child
mortality by prompting the decision to seek emergency interventions
Studies have shown that pregnant women put off making decisions to seek obstetric treatment because of poor
understanding of the risks and difficulties in pregnancy related complications
Studies done in Ethiopia revealed that
there is a lack of awareness of obstetric danger signs among pregnant women The majority of the research on
pregnant women s awareness of obstetric danger signs in Ethiopia was conducted in urban and institutional settings This
study helps in identifying the gaps in the community s understanding of obstetric danger signs level of knowledge of
pregnancy risk perception and attitude toward skilled delivery service use among pregnant women in rural areas It will
also be a resource for health service providers policymakers and program managers as they develop intervention
strategies to increase community awareness of obstetric danger signs and pregnancy risk As far as we are aware there
has never been a published study done in the rural environment on the topic Therefore this study sought to evaluate
pregnant women s perceptions of pregnancy risks degree of understanding of obstetric danger signs attitudes toward
using skilled delivery services and related factors in rural areas of Hadiya Zone Southern Ethiopia
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This study was conducted in two districts of Hadiya Zone Lemo and Ameka districts Hadiya Zone is situated
kilometers from Addis Ababa the capital city of Ethiopia in the South nation and nationalities regional state of Southern
Ethiopia The study took place between February and March A cross sectional study with a focus on the
community was used
All of the pregnant women who lived in the two districts during the study period comprised the source population
Participants who were gravely ill and unable to communicate were not included in this study This study was part of a cluster
randomized control trial study that examined the effectiveness of engagement of religious leaders in maternal health

education It is part of the baseline survey The sample size was determined based on a cluster randomized control trial study
design According to the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey skilled birth attendance in a rural area of Ethiopia
was predicted to be The sample size was based on power to detect a percentage point anticipated difference in
the proportion of skilled delivery service utilization an increase from to With a error level and design effect of
A sample size of pregnant mothers per cluster was required and accordingly the final calculated sample size was per
pregnant mothers per group after considering a loss
Twelve clusters from two Hadiya Zone districts were involved in this study Lemo and Ameka districts In order to locate
clusters kebeles a simple random sampling technique was used Pregnant women were then contacted using a cluster
sampling technique Interviews with pregnant women who met the inclusion requirements were conducted for the study The
participants in the baseline study did not Intend to leave their current residence before the completion of the follow up period
In cooperation with health extension workers and kebele leaders a census was carried out to determine all eligible pregnant
women of reproductive age years who permanently resided in the selected districts from the selected clusters Once
pregnancy was detected through census work the women would be recruited for the study
Data Collection and Procedure
We used questionnaires that already existed from studies done before and adapted them to fit our needs The questionnaires
were pretested and administered by an interviewer They were developed by the Johns Hopkins Program for International
Education in Gynaecology and Obstetrics JHPIEGO maternal and neonatal health program and we tweaked them to fit the
local context and our research goals We pre tested a survey among pregnant mothers who were not a part of the main
study The survey had five sections socio demographic obstetrics risk perception danger signs during pregnancy labor
delivery and postpartum period and attitude The data collectors went to respondents houses and interviewed them in person
to gather the data We recruited data collectors clinical nurses and BSc nurses and supervisors BSc degree in public
health We chose them based on their data collection experience and fluency in the language of the community They were
then trained on the objectives of the study the survey and the data collection process The principal investigators and
supervisors double checked the surveys to make sure they were complete and relevant
Quality Control
Internal consistency reliability was tested by calculating Cronbach s Alpha using SPSS window version
Furthermore health behavior experts crosschecked the content validity of the tool Data collectors and supervisors
were trained about the study instrument and data collection procedure The principal investigator and the supervisors
checked the collected data for completeness
Measurement and Operational Definitions of the Scale Variables
Pregnancy risk perception was assessed using the questionnaire developed from a previous study This questionnaire is made
up of nine questions which assess how a pregnant women perceive potential dangers during pregnancy In this study the
questionnaire consists oftwo subscales that include four questions about the risk to self mother for example Is the risk of
having a caesarean section and five questions about risk to the baby for example is a risk of baby having a birth defect
Respondents were asked to rate on a five pomt scale no risk at all unlikely possible High extremely high
how they perceived the pregnancy risk The scores from each of the items were added up to get a total pregnancy risk
perception score A higher score means that the person has a greater perception of risk The mean score was used to divide
people into two groups those with a high perception of risk and those with a low perception of risk
Pregnant women in this study mentioned danger signs during pregnancy delivery and postpartum period We
measured how much they knew about these danger signs by asking them to name them without giving leading questions
We sorted their knowledge into two categories pregnant women with good knowledge and pregnant women with poor
knowledge In this study a pregnant woman was deemed to be knowledgeable about the danger signs if she could either
spontaneously or upon prompting name at least three significant danger signs for each of the three periods of pregnancy
childbirth and postpartum The mothers were prompted by giving them more time to attempt and recall these periods

Attitude toward skilled delivery service utilization has items that were measured by using a Likert scale where
respondents were supposed to strongly agree agree neutral disagree and strongly disagree The overall attitude score
was computed by summing up the items after performing the reverse scoring for negatively worded sentences A higher
composite score indicated a more positive attitude The Mean score was used to categorize attitudes into positive and
negative attitudes
Data Processing and Analysis
Data were cleaned and entered using Epidata version and analyzed using SPSS version Logistic regression was
carried out to identify determmants of obstetric danger signs knowledge Variables with p in the bivariate analysis
were selected as candidate variables for multivariate logistic analysis to control the effect of confounders Adjusted odd
ratios AORs with their confidence interval and p were considered to have a significant association between
the outcome and independent variables The model fitness was checked using Hosmer and Lemeshow and was found fit

Factors Associated with Attitude Toward Skilled Delivery Service Utilization
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis perception of pregnancy risk and parity were significantly associated with
attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization Pregnant mothers with a high perception of pregnancy risk were
times more likely to have a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization than pregnant mothers with low

Discussion
The majority of preventable maternal deaths in developing countries are due to delays in the pregnant mother or her
family s decision to seek care delays in visiting the place of delivery and delays in receiving adequate hospital care In
such cases the lack of knowledge about pregnancy risk and obstetric danger signs and attitude towards skilled delivery
service utilization contribute to the delays in seeking emergency obstetric care resulting in high mortality and morbidity
rates Pregnant mothers can avoid obstetric complications if they can identify the forewarning pregnancy risks and
obstetric danger signs In resource limited countries like Ethiopia increasing the level of awareness of obstetric danger
signs and skilled delivery service utilization among women are feasible strategies to reduce maternal mortality and

morbidity related to obstetric complications However the pregnancy risk perception and level of knowledge are low
among women in Southern Africa including Ethiopia
This study was conducted to assess the current
pregnancy risk perception attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization and level of pregnant women s knowledge
of obstetric danger signs and related factors in rural areas in Hadiya Zone Southern Ethiopia
The result showed that more than half of pregnant mothers had a low perception of obstetric risks and the total and
a low mean score of pregnancy risk perception of This finding is lower than the one reported using different
instruments to measure pregnancy risk perception in Northern Ethiopia This study found that of respondents had
a high level of pregnancy risk perception The mean score in our study score is lower than the findings reported in
Canada mean score which utilized the same instrument to measure pregnancy risk perception among nulliparous
Canadian women of advanced maternal Similarly a study in Thailand found that women of advanced maternal age had
mean scores of perception of pregnancy risk that fell below This difference might be because of the difference
in maternal age and measurement instruments Another possible explanation is that risk perception in pregnancy is
multifaceted and influenced by multiple personal factors
In this research the overall proportion of knowledge of obstetric danger signs among pregnant mothers was
This finding is consistent with the finding reported in South Ethiopia in Yirgachefe city and Eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo Our study was done among rural mothers In this study the knowledge
of obstetric danger signs was higher than the findings reported in Wolayita Sodo City in Southern Ethiopia and
Jordan
In addition it is lower than the values reported by studies conducted in Chamwino District Tanzama
Angolela Tera District in Northern Ethiopia Hossan Town Southern Ethiopia Shashemane
Town in the Oromia region in Ethiopia and KwaZulu Natal in South Africa This discrepancy could be
differences in the sociocultural backgrounds that characterize each of these regions
In this study obstetric danger signs were categorized into three parts pregnancy labor childbirth and the postpartum
period The danger signs that were most frequently discussed during pregnancy were weakness vaginal
bleeding and reduced fetal movement which is contradictory to a study reported in the Eastern

Democratic Republic of the Congo which found that severe abdominal pain was the best known danger sign This
result was in line with other research findings published in Ethiopia and Africa and revealed that severe vaginal bleeding
was the frequently mentioned obstetric danger sign during pregnancy and postpartum period
Labor of more
than hours and abnormal fetal position were the most common danger Signs mentioned by study participants during
labor and childbirth This finding was consistent with the finding reported in Wolayita Sodo Town Southern Ethiopia
In this study the age of pregnant mothers maternal education and parity were determinants of knowledge of obstetric
danger signs Pregnant mothers aged years were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of
obstetric danger indicators This result is consistent with results from other studies that have been done in Arbaminch
Wolayita Sodo and Yirgacheffe Towns South Ethiopia and South Eastern Nigeria Women in this age category are
believed to be physically and psychologically ready to accept information about obstetric danger signs This result
contradicts a study conducted in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo that found women aged years
were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators
In this study maternal age education and parity were determinants of knowledge of obstetric danger signs Pregnant
mothers aged years were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators
This result is consistent with results from other studies that have been done in Arbaminch Wolayita Sodo and
Yirgacheffe Towns South Ethiopia and South Eastern Nigeria Women in this age category are believed to be physically
and psychologically ready to accept information about obstetric danger signs This result contradicts a study conducted in
the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo that found women aged years were more likely than other age
groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators
The multivariate logistic regression revealed that
the knowledge of obstetric danger signs among pregnant women was associated with parity The probability of knowing
obstetric danger signs decreased by among primipara mothers compared to nullipara mothers This finding contra
dicts the finding reported in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo However it is consistent with the results
reported in other studies
In this study the mean score of attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization was More than half of the study
participants had a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization This finding was lower than the
finding reported in Oromia Region Ethiopia Our finding is higher than the result reported in Northwest Ethiopia
A possible explanation could be differences in study setting and health program implementation This study
revealed that pregnant mothers with a high perception of pregnancy risk were more likely to have a positive attitude toward
skilled delivery service utilization than pregnant mothers with a low pregnancy risk perception This is because having risk
perception could develop a positive attitude towards health service utilization The utilization behavior of individuals is
driven by their perception to develop a positive attitude and take over the action It was also observed that pregnant mothers
who were multiparous were more likely to have a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization than
nulliparous pregnant mothers This may be because pregnant mothers who experienced previous births were more likely
to benefit from maternal health services and learn from their experiences
The results of this study have important policy implications Determining the level of the pregnancy risk perception
knowledge of obstetric danger signs and attitude of pregnant women towards skilled delivery service utilization can
predict their preventive practice and identifying variables is crucial for developing appropriate risk communication
methods and measures
Limitations
Regarding limitations of this study bias might be provoked in prompting the participants to mention the danger signs
though the authors tried their best to avoid it In addition reports of the pregnant mothers may under overestimate the
result because the data was collected by self report
Conclusion
In this study pregnancy risk perception attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization and level of pregnant
women s knowledge of obstetric danger indicators in Lemo and Ameka Districts of Hadiya Zone were low

The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments
childhood mortality and health of surviving children

Abstract
The potential death toll from an epidemic is larger than the number of deaths directly
associated with the infection In this study we find that prenatal exposure to a cholera
epidemic in Peru increased childhood mortality and that surviving children were
more likely to be underweight and to suffer from diarrhea We further find that a sig
nificant part of this mortality happened during the first day of life and that prenatal
exposure to cholera decreased prenatal care and institutional deliveries suggesting
that the mortality and possibly other longer term effects were partially driven by a
reduction in prenatal investments

Introduction
Epidemics have been on the rise for the past several decades and will likely continue
to do so in the near future The potential death toll attributable to an epidemic is
considerably larger than the number of deaths directly associated with the infection
Children exposed to an epidemic while in utero are particularly vulnerable infected

pregnant women can transmit the disease through the placenta and even if the virus
or bacteria does not affect the fetus directly symptoms of the disease such as dehy
dration high fever or stress can affect the fetus in ways that are not visible until after
the child is born or even later in life Additionally the economic hardship that an
epidemic imposes to pregnant women and their households and the potential satu
ration of the healthcare capacity can affect parental investments including maternal
nutrition vaccines and skilled care during pregnancy and during birth We know
from a number of studies in epidemiology and economics that in utero is a critical
developmental period and that shocks during this period including epidemics have
long term consequences Almond and Currie We know less about their effect
on postnatal childhood mortality and the potential mediating role of prenatal invest
ments In this study we aim to contribute to this literature by exploring the effects of
prenatal exposure to the Peruvian cholera epidemic in the early
There have been seven cholera pandemics in the last years The seventh began
in the early in Asia and spread through Africa and Europe in the early
Cholera rates remained relatively low during the and were confined to Asia
and Africa but in the early an outbreak began in Peru that became the first
cholera epidemic in Latin America since Lam et al Peru suffered the
most severe outbreak of cholera of the region and the health system collapsed in many
regions of the country Cueto With a large majority of the population work
ing informally without access to medical paid leave the epidemic also generated
important economic consequences for households and Bradford
From an empirical perspective studying the cholera epidemic in Peru is conve
nient because it began unexpectedly Disease control experts are largely at a loss to
explain why cholera has returned to South America in the first epidemic since
Brookes p The bacteria seemed to originate from the Pacific Ocean the
first cases spread from the coastal cities of Peru to other regions of the country and
later to other countries as well The abruptness and severity of the epidemic as well
as the speed of contagion provide us with a nearly ideal natural experiment In April
a professor from the University of Maryland School of Medicine commented
about the cholera epidemic in Peru It s pure guesswork as to where it is going
Brookes p In retrospect it seems that the spread of the disease over differ
ent regions of the country over time in particular during the first year of the epidemic
was largely determined by each region s geographical proximity to the initial cases
Within a region contagion was more likely under unsanitary conditions but not even
households with access to piped water at home were safe from contagion because
water was not sufficiently chlorinated Cueto
We apply a difference in difference methodology exploiting the spread of the
cholera epidemic in Peru by month and region Our data comes mainly from two
sources the Population Census of in which mothers were asked the birth date
of their youngest child born alive and whether or not that child was alive at the time
of the interview and the Health and Demographic Survey of which includes
information of childhood mortality and parental investments and allows us also to
control for mother fixed effects

The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments childhood
We find that an increase in I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during
the last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by per
centage points or according to our most conservative estimate The event study
shows that this effect was not driven by a pre existing trend We also find that later
mortality is concentrated in girls and that surviving children are more likely to suffer
from severe diarrhea and have lower weight for age and are more likely to be under
weight Finally we find that the epidemic increased first day mortality and reduced
prenatal care and institutional deliveries suggesting the mortality and possibly other
longer term effects were partially driven by a reduction in prenatal investments
There is a well established literature that shows that in utero is a particular sensi
tive stage in life for the formation of human capital Most of this literature focuses
on long term effects of prenatal exposure to a variety of shocks Almond and Currie
The seminal study of Almond finds that in utero exposure to the
influenza pandemic had long term negative effects in terms of education attainment
physical disability income and socioeconomic status Closely related to our study
Ogasawara and Inoue and Ritter find negative long term effects of pre
natal exposure to the cholera epidemic among adults in Japan and Peru respectively
A relatively smaller number of studies have shown that in utero shocks may have an
effect on postnatal childhood mortality In particular it has been shown that expo
sure to pollution Jayachandran extreme rainfall Rocha and Soares
extreme heat Banerjee and Maharaj and violent conflict Dagnelie et al
increases infant mortalityl This paper aims to contribute to this literature by ana
lyzing the effect of prenatal exposure to an epidemic on childhood mortality Our
results are particularly relevant in a context where official reports of deaths due to
epidemics in many countries differ considerably from estimations of the number of
excess deaths FT These estimations however do not disentangle what pro
portion of the excess deaths is due exclusively to underreporting of direct deaths from
that attributable to indirect deaths According to our estimations the total number of
children who died due to exposure to the cholera epidemic while in their last trimester
in utero was approximately while the official number of total cholera deaths for
is This means that the human cost of the epidemic was approximately
larger if we consider the effect of prenatal exposure on postnatal childhood mor
tality Moreover the official mortality rate from the cholera epidemic in Peru during
is in every inhabitants while our estimated mortality rate due to
prenatal exposure is in every children that were born alive in
With this paper we also aim to contribute to the literature by providing evidence of
the potential role of prenatal investments in particular prenatal care and institutional
deliveries as mediators between the in utero shock and the effect on childhood mor
tality and possibly longer term human capital outcomes Prenatal care is important to
prevent and treat conditions that might affect the mother and or the fetus but it is also
Other important studies that investigate postnatal early childhood shocks on mortality rate are included
in the review of Almond et al
As of July Peru has more than excess deaths per million inhabitants the highest rate in the
world which largely exceed reported numbers of Covid deaths Fl

important because it can affect maternal behavior such as smoking alcohol consump
tion nutrition and weight gain folic acid intake among others see for example
Evans and Lien and these behaviors have been shown to affect birth outcomes
and have long term human capital outcomes Aizer and Currie Nilsson
Simon Bharadwaj et al Barreca Institutional deliveries typically
involve skilled professionals with adequate equipments during and immediately after
birth which are important because they can perform C sections when needed resus
citate newborns at birth and treat maternal infections among other things According
to the World Health Organization approximately of all under five child deaths
are neonatal deaths and approximately half of all neonatal deaths occur after a home
birth and without any healthcare
There is also more rigorous evidence of the impact of institutional births and
access to healthcare on birth outcomes and infant lives Currie and Gruber
Maitra Daysal et al Godlonton and Okeke Goodman Bacon
Adam et al Okeke and Chari Friedman and Keats a Moreover
there is evidence that skilled care during and immediately after birth can treat prema
turity underweight and other conditions affecting newborns with proper care such as
artificial lung surfactant and specialized nutritional supplements that has long term
consequences on human capital Bharadwaj et al Epidemics have the poten
tial to affect access to prenatal care and institutional deliveries this has been seen for
example in the case of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa Jones et al Strong
and Schwartz although this evidence comes from correlational studies The
Ebola epidemic is probably an extreme case given the high probability of getting
infected in hospitals in addition to the fear of getting tested and isolated Strong and
Schwartz WHO In the case of COVID there is evidence that the
lockdown in India increased mortality rate by among dialysis patients The main
channels in this case appear to be barriers to transportation and disruption in hospital
services Jain and Dupas
In this study we show that even epidemics involving less contagious diseases
and that do not impose a need for social isolation such as the cholera epidemic can
generate a reduction in prenatal care and institutional deliveries Moreover many
other shocks that have been analyzed in the fetal origins literature droughts wars
famines and hurricanes among other things have the potential to affect access to
skilled care during pregnancy and birth hence the results of this paper can apply to
a wide range of shocks
Finally this paper speaks to the literature on diarrheal diseases childhood mor
tality and malnutrition Although we have found that the cholera epidemic reduced
prenatal investment we cannot discard the potential direct role of the disease in our
mortality estimates and on the health status of the surviving children The World
Health Organization estimates that each year diarrheal diseases such as cholera kill
around half a million children under five and are the leading cause of malnutrition
On a positive note Christensen et al show that certain interventions focused on enhancing health
worker performance led to improvements in maternal utilization of clinics during the Ebola crisis in rural
Sierra Leone

The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments childhood
Typically these estimates come from contemporaneous effects of these diseases and
hence most programs target children after they are born This study suggests how
ever that protecting children from these diseases after they are born might already be
too late
Background cholera and the cholera epidemic in Peru
Cholera is one of the most common diarrheal diseases along with Rotavirus E coli
Shigella Campylobacter and Salmonella WHO It is generated by a bacte
rial infection The main effect is acute diarrhea and all the other consequences are
believed to derive from this main effect Seas and Gotuzzo Profuse diarrhea
causes dehydration pathogens damage the intestines causing an excessive amount of
water and other nutrient rich fluids to be secreted rather than being absorbed Among
pregnant women particularly during the third trimester severe dehydration is associ
ated with a reduction of amniotic fluid reduced blood flood to the placenta placental
hemorrhage hypotension preterm births and miscarriages Grados and Battilana

Over the last years there have been cholera pandemics The last pandemic
still lingers in many countries As of approximately billion people were
at risk for cholera and approximately million cholera cases occur annually in
countries where it is endemic while approximately cholera cases occur in
non endemic countries Ali et al In terms of deaths approximately
and people are reported to die annually of choler
