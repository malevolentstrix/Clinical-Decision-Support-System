comparisons with chronic pathologies such as diabetes
The results obtained concerning physical activity and
pain in pregnant women can be compared to those ob
tained for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular dis
eases diabetes and cancer A study by Sprangers et
al in found an average value of in the Physical
Functions and in the Bodily Pain categories con
cerning diabetic patients In comparison we found
values between and for Physical Functions and
between and for Bodily Pain in pregnant women
Moreover quality of life refers to subjective elements
that may vary from one culture to another In the Coban
et al study undertaken in three countries over three
continents China Ghana USA the subjective con
cepts of well being or vitality were perceived and
measured in very different ways on the three continents
This study did not focus on the quality of life of fathers
According to the Abassi et al study the quality of life of
fathers was significantly higher during pregnancy and
postpartum than that of their partner Specifically
their physical quality of life was significantly higher
Their mental quality of life was close and there was no
significant difference between them and their partner in
two studies where this was studied Finally we
believe that it is necessary to systematically screen
women having a poor quality of life during pregnancy
Studies have to determine whether a single question is
sufficient in clinical practice or whether it is preferable
to have a more specific questionnaire before the
follow up consultation
Conclusions
Health related quality of life refers to the subjective as
sessment of patients regarding the physical mental and
social dimensions of well being Women s subjective per
ception of their health related quality of life is an essen
tial measure of the quality and effectiveness of maternal
and child health interventions However few women
less than speak spontaneously about their
psychological ill health to a health professional Health
authorities recommendations are needed to better de
tect a poor quality of life of pregnant women and to
evaluate the impact of care in terms of quality of life of
pregnant women Then given the diversity of factors as
sociated with the quality of life the medical and para
medical professions need to work in cohesion with
social agencies networks and associations

A Check for updates
BACKGROUND Both obesity and excessive gestational weight gain
are associated with severe maternal morbidity but there is limited litera
ture evaluating whether the risk of severe maternal morbidity is further
increased by the degree or severity of excessive gestational weight gain
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to determine whether pregnant patients
with excessive gestational weight gain who gained more than lb were
at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity compared with those who
only moderately exceeded recommended gestational weight gain guide
lines A secondary objective was to determine whether patients who
gained lb more than the recommended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy body mass index group were at increased risk of
severe maternal morbidity compared with those who exceeded that upper
limit by a lesser amount
STUDY DESIGN This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients
with live term singleton deliveries with excessive gestational weight gain
from hospitals within a large health system in New York between Janu
ary and February Excessive gestational weight gain was
defined as exceeding the recommended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy body mass index category using the National
Academy of Medicine gestational weight gain guidelines lb for a
body mass index of kg lb for a body mass index of
to kg lb for a body mass index of to kg and
lb for a body mass index of kg Patient height and weight
data were self repotted at the time of delivery hospitalization and retrieved
from the electronic medical record system Patients were classified into
excessive gestational weight gain groups moderate lb or severe
lb Patients with missing body mass index or gestational weight
gain were excluded The primary exposure was severe excessive gesta
tional weight gain The primary outcome was severe maternal morbidity
defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria
Logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of severe maternal
morbidity adjusting for race and ethnicity nulliparity advanced maternal
age gestational diabetes mellitus and maternal mood disorder For the
secondary analysis severe maternal morbidity rates were compared
between patients who exceeded their body mass index specific upper
limit of total weight gain by lb and those who exceeded it by lb
RESULTS A total of patients were included for analysis and
patients had severe excessive gestational weight gain The
overall rate of severe maternal morbidity was Severe maternal mor
bidity occurred in of patients with severe excessive gesta
tional weight gain and of patients with moderate
excessive gestational weight gain On regression analysis after adjust
ment for covariate factors patients with a severe excessive gestational
weight gain were more likely to experience severe maternal morbidity
than those with moderate excessive gestational weight gain adjusted odds
ratio confidence interval Patients with excessive
gestational weight gain of lb above the recommended body mass
index specific upper limit for gestational weight gain were more
likely adjusted odds ratio confidence interval to
experience severe maternal morbidity than patients who exceeded that
upper limit by lb
CONCLUSION Patients with live term singleton pregnancies who
gain more than lb are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity
compared with those who only moderately exceed gestational weight gain
guidelines Similarly patients who gain lb above the recommended
body mass index specific upper limit for gestational weight gain are at
increased risk Further study is warranted to determine the most effective
intetwentions to manage gestational weight gain and mitigate maternal
risk

reportedly affects of deliveries but
the rate is much higher in populations
with more maternal comorbidities
Obesity is the most common comorbid
ity in reproductive age women and it is
a known risk factor for several other
medical comorbidities According to the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven
tion CDC of pregnant women in
the United States are obese before preg
nancy There is a well established asso
ciation between obesity and SMM In
addition previous studies have demon
strated that pregnant patients who
exceed gestational weight gain GWG
guidelines are at increased risk of SMM
compared with those who do not
However based on our review of the lit
erature few studies have evaluated
whether the risk of SMM is further
increased by the degree or severity of
excessive GWG EGWG
The most widely accepted GWG
guidelines are those published in
by the Institute of Medicine
now known as the National Academy of
Medicine Recommendations are pro
vided on the basis of prepregnancy
body mass index BMI classification

Why was this study conducted
Previous studies have shown that pregnant patients who exceed gestational
weight gain GWG guidelines are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity
SMM compared with those who do not However based on our review of the
literature few studies have evaluated whether the risk of SMM is further
increased by the degree or severity of excessive GWG EGWG
Key findings
In this retrospective cohort study of patients with EGWG those who
gained lb severe EGWG were more likely to experience SMM than
those who gained lb moderate EGWG after adjustment for covariate fac
tors adjusted odds ratio confidence interval
What does this add to what is known
Among pregnancies affected by EGWG the degree or severity of EGWG is posi
tively associated with a risk of SMM
pregnancies the upper limits of recom
mended GWG vary from to lb for
patients with obesity BMI of kg
and patients who are underweight
BMI of kg respectively
This study aimed to evaluate how the
severity of EGWG is associated with
SMM To provide more interpretable
and generalizable information we
assessed an arbitrary threshold of exces
siveness that could be applied across all
BMI groups one that was lb above
the upper limit of the highest recom
mended GWG of any prepregnancy
BMI group in the guidelines ie
lb for women who are underweight
Specifically our primary objective was
to determine whether pregnant patients
who gain more than lb severe
EGWG are at higher risk of SMM than
those who only moderately exceed rec
ommended guidelines lb We
hypothesized that patients who gained
more than lb would be at increased
risk of SMM compared with those who
did not A secondary objective was to
determine whether patients who gained
lb more than the recommended
upper limit of total weight gain for a
given BMI group were at increased risk
of SMM compared with those who
exceeded that upper limit but by lb

associated with a greater degree of
GWG The authors compared the out
comes among groups below within
to lb above and lb above
GWG guidelines based on prepreg
nancy BMI class Although that study
evaluated some severe maternal out
comes it did not comprehensively eval
uate all SMM outcomes Leonard et al
evaluated the association between
AJOG MFM January
GWG and SMM using the CDC crite
ria across each BMI group and con
cluded that higher GWG correlated
with increased risk of SMM but with
differential effects based on the prepreg
nancy BMI group In our study we
observed that patients with a GWG of
lb severe EGWG were at a higher
risk of SMM than those with a GWG of
lb moderate EGWG
Clinical implications
Severe EGWG is a modifiable clinical
risk factor for SMM Based on our find
ings patients with EGWG should
receive counseling about their increased
risk and early intervention and man
agement strategies should be imple
mented to reduce the likelihood of
adverse outcomes All pregnant patients
should track weight gain consume bal
anced diets avoid highly processed
foods and engage in moderate intensity
aerobic exercise Additional strategies
are warranted for patients who exceed
GWG guidelines and for those at the
highest risk of doing so such as those
with mood disorders
For these
patients at increased risk nutrition
counseling by registered dietitians may
increase adherence to dietary recom
mendations
Research implications
Although SMM was increased in the
group with severe EGWG we were
unable to detect a difference in the fre
quency of individual SMM indicators
eg blood transfusion between study
groups Based on our sample size it is
not certain whether the increase is
attributable to specific SMM indicators
or increased uniformly across all SMM
indicators Larger samples or popula
tion based studies may provide more
insight Moreover it is possible that the
effect of severe EGWG on SMM may be
modified by the presence or absence of
intermediate outcomes For example
many but not all pregnancies with
severe EGWG will be complicated by
macrosomia this fetal complication
increases the risk of postpartum hemor
rhage because of overdistention of the
uterus which may lead to a blood trans
fusion the most common form of
SMM Mediation analysis can be per
formed to better understand the under
lying mechanism or process by which
severe EGWG influences SMM risk
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths The
patient population is diverse resides in
both urban and suburban communities
and spans the socioeconomic spectrum

groups is that it is easily understood
and communicated
In addition our study has several limi
tations First our study had a retrospec
tive observational study design
Therefore we could only establish an
association between severe EGWG and
SMM rather than a direct cause and
effect relationship Second GWG data
were self reported at the time of delivery
hospitalization and there was a risk of
recall bias Third our primary outcome
was based on administrative billing
data and there was a risk of erroneous
or inconsistent coding practices Never
theless all data were retrieved from a
shared electronic health record system
that is used across all included hospital
sites which should have limited misclas
sification Finally our analysis was
restricted to term pregnancies because
guidelines were developed for this
group which excluded a substantial
portion of SMM Furthermore we did

nancies who gain more than lb
throughout pregnancy are at increased
risk of SMM compared with those who
only moderately exceed GWG guide
lines Moreover those who gain lb
above the recommended BMI specific
upper limit for GWG are more likely to
experience SMM than those who exceed
the guidelines to a lesser degree Further
study is warranted to determine the
most effective interventions to manage
GWG and mitigate maternal risk

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective To explore work arounds at faith based obstetrics and gynecology residency programs to ac
complish family planning training
Study design We invited educational stakeholders to participate in telephone interviews that elicited
strategies for overcoming barriers to family planning training in religious settings
Results Eighteen out of invited programs leaders participated Work arounds included reliance on
non contraceptive indications for contraception and permanent contraception provision obtaining ethics
committee approvals for service provision and developing partnerships with offsite centers for training
Conclusion Ob gyn residency programs affiliated with religious hospitals utilize various work arounds
for family planning training and patient care These findings may inform other programs that face similar
barriers secondary to institutional or governmental restrictions

Catholic facilities are expected to follow institutional guide
lines set forth by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops known
as the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Ser
vices The Directives prohibit most reproductive services includ
ing contraception permanent contraception and abortion based
on their belief that sexual intercourse is reserved for the inten
tion of procreation and that life begins at conception
Recent
evidence demonstrates that non Catholic faith based hospitals also
face restrictions to abortion provision
As Roe v Wade is now
overturned many states are facing new regulations to abortion
provision
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
ACGME mandates comprehensive family planning education in
cluding abortion training at all obstetrics and gynecology ob
gyn programs regardless of institutional filiation with the abil
ity of individual residents to opt out based on personal or moral
Program leaders at religious hospitals particularly
concerns

Catholic sites have historically faced the challenge of providing
comprehensive family planning training while adhering to institu
tional guidelines In this study we sought to explore the barriers
that program leaders face and the strategies used to accomplish
comprehensive family planning training at faith based hospitals in
the form of work arounds
Materials and methods
We previously identified ob gyn residency programs in
which at least of resident time was spent at a Catholic or
other faith based hospital that prohibited reproductive services
and invited them to participate in an online survey study
These programs accounted for of the ACGME accredited
ob gyn residency programs in and are responsible for
approximately graduating residents each year In this study
the senior author invited the educational stakeholders mainly
program directors who responded to the original online survey
and expressed a willingness to participate in a follow up to
minute telephone interview We offered a gift card as
remuneration
Our telephone interviews explored onsite strategies offsite col
laborations ongoing barriers and respondents understanding of
institutional and educational requirements The senior investiga
tor MG conducted all interviews informed survey respondents
that participation was voluntary and any personal or institutional

names would be deidentified during analysis After full disclosures
we obtained oral consent We chose to write notes rather than
audio record given the sensitive nature of this study and partici
pant concerns for employment repercussions
To identify common work arounds and strategies investiga
tors performed directed content analysis of interview notes We
received exemption approval from the Colorado Multiple Institu
tional Review Board based on the deidentified nature minimal risk
to participants and exclusion of personal health information
Results
Eighteen of the ob gyn program leaders that primarily
train residents at a religious hospital completed the telephone in
terview of the participants were based at Catholic sites
Respondents included program directors one department
chair and one faculty attending tasked with family planning ed
ucation Seventeen interviews occurred between March and
November with one additional in April We considered
a lack of response to the interview invitation correspondence as
refusal to participate in the study
Many participants used online trainings and simulation for fam
ily planning procedures for contraception permanent contracep
tion and abortion care Table
presents key findings of the work
arounds reported by interviewed stakeholders organized by fam
ily planning method We did not detect contraception or perma
nent contraception training concerns among the eight non Catholic
faith based programs during interviews Respondents who previ
ously received Residency Review Committee RCC citations for in
adequate training explained how these citations were helpful as
they often provided leverage to improve training
Discussion
We found varying ways in which religious ob gyn residency
programs accomplished family planning training The extent to
which contraception and permanent contraception provision oc
curred onsite at Catholic facilities was often dependent on lo
cal interpretations of the directives and acceptance of work
arounds Regarding abortion training offsite collaborations were
most often employed as suffcient onsite training was not possi
ble at all the religious hospital sites Local factors including fac
ulty leaders state settings and malpractice concerns served as
modifiers to how feasible or successful community partnerships
occurred
In recent years of all U S ob gyn residency program di
rectors have cited some sort of institutional or governmental re
striction that interferes with abortion training With the fall
of Roe states may ban abortion potentially eliminating train
ing for almost half of U S ob gyn residency programs
This will cause a detrimental impact on the training of of
the total ob gyn residents in the U S
To continue com
prehensive training of future ob gyn physicians educational lead
ers will have to prepare for a changing and more restrictive envi
ronment Strategies employed by our respondents may guide such
ob gyn programs and those at religious settings that are transition
ing from osteopathic to ACGME accreditation status Our work may
also aid residency programs of other specialties that train physi
cians in family planning services including family medicine inter
nal medicine and pediatrics
Due to the nature of an interview study our findings were
limited by participation bias It is possible that respondents were
more likely to have strong opinions about abortion training in their
programs than those who did not participate We deliberately took
notes instead of audio recordings so that respondents would feel

Abortion
Approval for onsite abortion if threat to maternal life
or lethal fetal anomalies
Multidisciplinary collaborations with maternal fetal
medicine representatives and the ethics committee
helped gain approvals for onsite abortion
Induction of labor permitted over D E based on
interpretation of this method as an indirect
