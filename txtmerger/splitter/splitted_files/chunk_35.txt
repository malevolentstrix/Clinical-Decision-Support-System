More studies involving larger samples are needed in
order to define the actual risks during pregnancy and the age
to which the term advanced maternal age could properly
be used It has been shown that there is an inconsistency in
the literature between the definition of and the risk
assessment of the older pregnant woman In addition
healthcare providers perceptions and experiences of caring
for women of AMA would also be an invaluable resource if
it were to be documented Healthcare providers would then
be able to find out how other members of their profession

Abstract Recent upsurge of social working couples low income levels of welfare support for children etc As the country
expanded most of the home by parents entrust their children to kindergarten or preschool child s growth education and has
commissioned As a result shipments of kindergarten children or helping with school bus accidents occur frequently in and
out and also a national problem of low birth rate due to the increase in child or family members including two children
and their children too much attention on the increase due to the obese children that is no drill Thus children in the park in
order to maintain a safe and healthy life safety and growth of children by building management systems with their parents
and their teachers hayeogeum park comfortably and safely establish a system to manage children hayeoteum
I Introduction
A Children in govemment health care continues to rise
many govemment policies such as obesity management are
suggested However the management of this series is
entirely parent or the kindergarten nursery school teacher s
duty of care of business due to a unique addition to the
existing restaurant that is more burdened Childhood
obesity related youth years when the prevalence of
obesity in to from in has shown an
increasing phenomenon In addition the relationship
between the park with a large number of children living
disease caused by a large number of children is expected
to spread and also as a kindergarten school bus accidents
is steadily and rapidly School children and the vehicle in
front of the house before you alTive to pick you and your
child must be pre waiting and waiting for the vehicle to
inclement weather has been caused inconvenience
Therefore these social problems and to manage and protect
children from parents and teachers while reducing the
workload of infants comfortably and safely manage the
introduction of a system that can be kept safe and
comfortable life in the system was applied

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy HDPs are no longer seen as transitory diseases cured by delivery It accounts for up to
of maternal deaths Information concerning HDPs is less in developing countries like Ghana This study was conducted to
find out the prevalence awareness risk factors control and the birth outcomes of HDPs This was a retrospective cohort
study conducted among pregnant women seeking care in selected health facilities in the Ashanti Region Data on
demographics HDPs and its associated birth outcomes were collected Logistic regression models were used to examine the
association of the independent variables with HDPs The burden of HDPs was among the mothers enrolled with
chronic hypertension superimposed with preeclampsia accounting for chronic hypertension and preeclampsia
whilst gestational hypertension was It was observed that of the mothers had excellent knowledge on
HDPs Oral nifedipine and methyldopa were frequently used for HDP management and it resulted in a significant reduction
in HDP burden from to Factors that influenced the increased risk of HDPs were grand multigravida
AOR CI family history of hypertension AOR CI and the consumption of herbal
preparations AOR CI and alcohol AOR CI during pregnancy HDPs increased the
risk of preterm delivery AOR CI stillbirth AOR CI and undergomg caesarean
section AOR CI amongst mothers during delivery The burden of HDPs is high amongst pregnant
mothers seeking care in selected facilities There is the need for intensified campaign on HDPs in the Ashanti Region of Ghana
Background
Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy HDPs are the leading
cause of maternal mortality It contributes to and
maternal mortality worldwide and in Sub Saharan
Africa SSA respectively Chronic hypertension pre
eclampsia eclampsia gestational hypertension and chronic
hypertension superimposed preeclampsia are the four cate
gories of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy In Ghana
it is estimated that the maternal mortality rate is deaths
per live births This is about times higher
than the UN recommended rate One of commonest cause
of direct maternal death identified was severe preeclampsia
eclampsia which accounted for of all direct maternal
deaths and of all maternal deaths in
Factors such as educational level age higher parity
occupation family of HDPs gravida complications of preg
nancy and others such as healthcare systems and social cul
tural and economic factors are seen to be associated with
HDPs Studies have shown that a woman s knowledge
about her condition can influence early health seeking
behaviour and compliance to treatment which would result
in early diagnosis and prevent pregnancy complication
including death Lack of knowledge on HDPs could lead
to misconceptions which may include interpretation of
warning signs as normal occurrence during pregnancy or
as spiritual attacks Although maternal serum
concentrations have been found to be associated with
early onset preeclampsia the cause of HDPs remains
unclear and treatment remains symptomatic with the pri
mary objective being the safety of the mother Over the
years HDPs have being controlled with regular blood pres
sure monitoring use of approved pharmacotherapeutics
and other nonpharmacological preventive measures
Target of the Sustainable Development Goals SDG
as set by the United Nations is aimed at reducing the mater
nal mortality ratio to per live births by
However the burden of hypertension has been increas
ing over the past few decades in SSA and a large percentage
of the population with hypertension remains untreated inef
fectively treated or even undiagnosed Furthermore
this study is important because much research has studied
the prevalence awareness and control of hypertension
among the general population however there is a need for
studies focused on pregnant women as the effect of HDPs
include risk of harm not only to the mother but also to the
unborn child HDPs are no longer seen as transitory dis
eases cured by delivery but as windows into the woman s
future health that needs integrated care coordinating treat
ment to identify risk factors and correct them This
study is aimed at identifying the prevalence risks awareness
control and the birth outcomes of HDPs among pregnant
women in some selected health facilities in the Ashanti
Region of Ghana
Methods
Study Design and Site This was a retrospective cohort
study which employed a well structured pretested close
response questionnaire to obtain data from pregnant women
who were seeking care at four hospitals in the Ashanti
Region The Ashanti Region is the second most populous
region in Ghana GSS with over hospitals both
private and public hospitals The study sites included the
Ejisu Government Hospital Ejisu Municipal Kwame
Nkrumah University of Science and Technology KNUST
Hospital Oforikrom Municipal Kumasi South Hospital
Asokwa Municipal and the Komfo Anokye Teaching
Hospital KATH Kumasi Metropolis Bantama sub metro

tion in the region and the large coverage of patients they
cater for
Sample and Sampling This study included pregnant
women above the ages of years who had been admitted
for delivery and those who had delivered at the hospital dur
ing the period of the study Pregnant women who were on
admission for other reasons besides delivery were excluded
At a significance level of the Yamane method was
used to determine the sample size The estimated num
ber of live births in the Ashanti Region in was
If the number of live births equals the number of preg
nant women for the year a sample size of pregnant
women would be suffcient Considering nonresponse rate
a minimum of about pregnant women were recruited
From this figure and
mothers were recruited from the Ejisu District
Hospital KNUST Hospital Kumasi South Hospital and
KATH respectively Employing quota sample size for each
facility was determined using the documented average
monthly delivery at each hospital
Consented participants were screened for eligibility Par
ticipants who were eligible for this study were numbered and
randomly sampled using an online number generator Par
ticipants whose numbers were generated were included in
the study
Development and Validation of Questionnaire The
questionnaire was developed after reviewing several litera
tures to ensure that the items capture a meaningful construct
to have causality to the outcome of interest The question
naire was piloted within a selected hospital To assess the
reliability of the construct of composite variables such as
the level of knowledge a Cronbach alpha test was con
ducted For the Cronbach alpha test for level of knowledge
the score was which indicates that the composite vari
able is reliable Information was collected on their socio
demographic characteristics factors influencing their risk
of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy level of awareness
management of the disorders and the birth outcomes
The level of knowledge was assessed as an item com
posite variable For a correct response a code of was
assigned and for a wrong response a code of O was assigned
Therefore a participant can score a maximum of and a
minimum of O Where a participant scores less than and
then the participant has poor level of knowledge scoring
between and was considered satisfactory level of knowl
edge and to was considered good level of knowledge
A participant is considered to have an excellent level of
knowledge on HDPs if the participant scores to
Code of was assigned to participants who had HDPs
and O to participants who did not have evidence of HDPs
Thus the dependent variable hypertensive disorder in preg
nancy was measured as a binary outcome

Discussion
Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy HDPs have been
established to be a leading cause of maternal deaths
accounting for about to of all maternal deaths
in the country In a study conducted in a teaching hos
pital in Ghana in the burden of HDPs was found
which is about two times the global burden With
a national maternal mortality of in it was esti
mated that up to maternal deaths in Ghana were caused
by hypertensive disorders
The burden of HDPs in this study was and
of the participants had no HDPs which is comparable to a
study by Awuah et al in which the burden of HDPs
was and the proportion of women without HDPs
was Although the sample size was less compared to
this study the prevalence of gestational hypertension and
preeclampsia were high compared to chronic hypertension
in pregnancy Awuah recorded and for preeclamp
sia and gestational hypertension respectively against
and in this study Another study which was conducted
in a tertiary hospital in the Ashanti Region also recorded a
prevalence of and for gestational hypertension

and preeclampsia respectively A systematic review of
HDPs in Ethiopia pooled a national prevalence of with
subgroup analysis by region showing a higher prevalence of
HDPs This confirms the high prevalence of HDPs in
the region and the needs for better strategies for prevention
to improve pregnancy outcomes are required in the mater
nity care centers
The disparity of the disease burden among the various
studies could be attributed to a lack of consensus on the
diagnostic criteria of the various hypertensive disorders
This is because the health facilities in this study all use treat
ment protocols similar to the national standard treatment
guidelines for management of HDPs However the
blood pressure level to start treatment depends on the facil
ity prescriber on duty and other patient related factors
It would be appropriate to address these discrepancies so
that accurate prevalence can be recorded and tackled well
Despite the above explanation Ghana has often recorded
a high burden of HDPs and this should be of national health
concern because it has been a major cause of maternal and
prenatal morbidity and mortality
Knowledge of an individual on a particular health condi
tion influences the health seeking behaviour of individual
Thus knowledge on HDPs has been assessed as efforts
at preventing HDP burden It is evident from this study that
almost half of the women have excellent knowledge of
HDPs This is very encouraging Having more knowledge
would mean that the mother would be informed on the
causes risk factors signs symptoms and possibly treatment
options for HDPs Considering the negative effect of these
disorders on both maternal and neonatal outcomes coupled
with the associated economic cost of management an
increase in knowledge would go a long way to decrease the
burden of the disorders improve treatment compliance
and overall reduce maternal and neonatal morbidities and
mortalities associated with the disorders It is expected that
as the knowledge of an individual increases the risk of con
tracting that disease reduces

FIGURE Proportion of various types of HDPs amongst study
respondents
Oral nifedipine and oral methyldopa at different doses
were the drugs often prescribed This finding is similar to
the findings of Kumar et al where it was observed that both
nifedipine and methyldopa are the most prescribed antihy
pertensives in pregnancy Nifedipine is a calcium chan
nel blocker which is effective at reducing blood pressure
without uteroplacental blood flow nor slowing foetal heart
rate While methyldopa is preferred because it is a cen
trally acting a agonist that decreases sympathetic outflow to
decrease BP it has a very long duration of action and the
best safety profile amongst the antihypertensive drugs used
during pregnancy Currently methyldopa has no associ
ated congenital anomaly The prescribed medications are
accepted for the management of hypertensive disorders in
pregnancy because of their low risk of adverse complications
in pregnancy All the prescribed drugs are in line with the
stated guidelines
The mean blood pressure of pregnant women at week
gestation was mmHg which is considered nor
mal However this average is confounded by several factors
such as the gestational stage and the baseline blood pressure
at the start of the pregnancy At around the fifth week of ges
tation there is an expansion of the blood volume which
causes a drop in the blood pressure of the mother At this
critical stage hypertensive mothers may appear to have a
normal blood pressure This may have accounted for
the normotensive mean blood pressure of mothers at that
gestational age At the point of delivery it was realized that
the mean BP of the mothers was mmHg which
saw a significant increase of the mean diastolic pressure of
the mothers Even though the mean blood pressures of the
mothers were still within the normotensive regions This
increase in the mean diastolic pressure may be normaliza
tion of the BP after the initial drop of the blood pressure
Again from the results obtained it was realized that
there was a significant decrease in the proportion of mothers
who had high blood pressure by Table This
indicates that management of mothers who had high blood
Journal of Pregnancy
pressure at week gestation resulted in a decrease of the
proportion of mothers who had high blood pressure at the
time of delivery It is also worth noting that as part of man
agement some proportion of mothers delivered preterm as
part of efforts to avert adverse birth complications Thus
at time of delivery these mothers would be hypertensive
Hence although there was a drop the proportion of mothers
who were hypertensive at delivery was significantly higher
and of public health concern
The level of education influenced the risk of being hyper
tensive in pregnancy such that mothers who had junior high
school education were less likely to develop HDPs com
pared to the likelihood of mothers without any formal edu
cation developing HDPs This finding is consistent with
the findings of Abalos et al where evidence obtained
established that education was a risk factor for hypertensive
disorders This may be that as an individual that is educated
there is an increased chance of been informed on the risk
factors and prevention of HDPs So that they may take nec
essary measures to prevent the risk of developing HDPs
However there was no statistical significance association
between the odds of mothers who had no formal education
developing HDPs compared to the odds of mothers who
had other levels of education developing HDPs Under the
bivariate analysis mothers with tertiary education were
times more likely to develop HDPs compared to
mothers who had no formal education However after
adjusting for known confounders this association dimin
ished with no statistical significance This indicates that the
observed association maybe an anomaly and as such it is
inconclusive to suggest that education status influences the
risk of HDPs in this study
It was also realized that high number of pregnancies
greatly influenced the risk of HDPs Table Though sev
eral studies such as Sengodan and Sreeprathi have
established that primigravid mothers were at risk of HDPs
the findings from this study corroborate the evidence by
Cho et al that mothers with multiple gestation have
an increased risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy
particularly preeclampsia However it has been established
that up to about of hypertensive disorders do not
resolve after delivery When these hypertensions do
not resolve before a woman gets pregnant again it is consid
ered as chronic hypertension in pregnancy and thus
increases the cumulative burden of hypertensive disorders
amongst mothers with multigravidity
Genetics has been explained to influence the risk of
chronic disease in several populations The evidence of this
study suggests that mothers who have family history of
HDPs were at times increased risk of developing HDPs
compared to women who have no family history of hyper
tensive disorders This is in sync with the systematic review
by Tesfa et al which confirmed that family history of
hypertension increased the risk of hypertensive disorders
in pregnancy by fourfolds Since family members share some
genetic make up and some lifestyle or habits there is an
increased likelihood that they may share similar risk of a
particular disease burden This explains why mothers
with family history of hypertensive disorders are at an

increased risk of HDPs It is therefore recommended that in
diagnosing a mother of HDPs the risk profile should con
sider the history of hypertension in the family This would
help in early diagnosing and management of hypertensive
disorders
The use of complementary and alternative medicine
CAM is predominant in Ghana and it is recognized by
the health system Nonetheless the role of CAM in
management of HDPs is scarce Evidence from this
study found that mothers who used herbal medicines were
times more likely to have HDPs Some studies have
reported the beneficial use of CAM in pregnancy and how
it has improved on blood pressure levels and also on various
obstetric outcomes
This study s finding does not imply that the use of herbal
medicines negatively increases blood pressure This is
because the study is methodologically limited to the use of
herbal medicines It did not assess the type of herbal medi
cine used how the herbal medicines were used and whether
it was prescribed or was appropriate for use However this
finding reveals a very critical issue of the appropriate use
of herbal medicines in pregnancy Herbal medicines are
made up of several constituents and the safety of their use
should be ascertained Currently there is paucity of infor
mation on the use of herbal medicine in the management
of hypertensive disorders particularly in pregnancy More
research evidence would be needed to understand why preg
nant women in selected health facilities use these medicines
its constituents and appropriateness for use in hypertensive
disorders
Alcohol consumption is known to influence hyperten
Sive disorders in adults Several studies have propounded
that alcohol consumption particularly heavy consumption
increases the risk of hypertension in normotensive individ
uals From this study alcohol consumers were times
more likely to experience HDPs compared to nonalcohol
consumers Alcohol has a biphasic effect on blood pressure
In less than hours after consumption alcohol reduces
blood pressure and subsequently after hours alcohol
tends to increase blood pressure It is believed to influence
the blood pressure through the renin angiotensin aldosterone
system by increasing the concentration and activity of renin
in blood An increase in renin is associated with an
increase in a potent vasoconstrictor called angiotensin II
responsible for the rise in blood pressure Additionally alcohol
is believed to reduce the baroreceptor sensitivity thus affecting
blood pressure regulation at the long term It is advised
that mothers must be counseled during ANC visits to strictly
avoid alcohol intake during pregnancy
The aetiology of these HDPs however is not known
It is therefore recommended that to effectively reduce
the incidence of HDPs pregnant women should be coun
seled on the risk factors of these conditions and screened
for during their antenatal care visits to prevent the adverse
effects of its complications
Some studies have established that HDPs influence the
birth outcomes at delivery From this study mothers who
had HDPs were times more likely to have preterm babies
This finding is consistent with a study by Xiong et al
where it was realized that HDPs increased the risk of stillbirth
by twelvefolds Hypertension is known as the leading cause of
stillbirth by affecting the development of the placenta by
restricting nutrient and oxygen flow to the foetus Also it
increases the risk of abnormal bleeding between the placenta
and uterine walls leading to placenta abruption All these
causes foetal distress and subsequently death Thus it is

critical to deliver the baby before term to avert foetal distress
and possibly foetal wastage
Another evidence from this study reveals that hyperten
Sive mothers were times more likely to undergo caesar
ean section This finding is consistent with the findings of
Roberts et al where it was realized that HDPs were
associated
with an increased risk of caesarean section
amongst mothers during delivery Considering this evidence
it is recommended that health professionals in charge of
antenatal care critically monitor hypertensive mothers dur
ing care and to pragmatically help to control their blood
pressure to normotensive status before delivery
Conclusion and Recommendations
The overall prevalence of HDPs was with chronic
hypertension superimposed with preeclampsia having the
highest prevalence of Lack of formal education fam
ily history multigravida consumption of alcohol and herbal
preparation were identified as factors that could influence
the risk of HDPs The use oral nifedipine and methyldopa
considerably reduced the proportion of mothers with high
blood pressure The selected mothers with HDPs were likely
to undergo caesarean sections experience stillbirth or have
preterm babies The burden of HDPs is high amongst preg
nant women seeking care in selected facilities There is the
need for intensified campaign on HDPs in the Ashanti
Region of Ghana
Considering the increasing risk of HDPs in the Ashanti
region its increased adverse association to obstetric out
comes such as stillbirth preterm and caesarean section
there is the need to investigate the cost impact of HDPs on
the mother and the household Additionally the quality of
life of mothers diagnosed with HDPs and the impact of
HDPs on the risk of prenatal and postnatal depression
should be assessed further
Strength and Limitations
This study was well powered considering the sample size as
such reducing the risk of type error Additionally the par
ticipants were clearly defined using the inclusion and exclu
Sion criteria outcomes were appropriately measured and
potential confounding factors were considered in the analy
sis Therefore findings of this study are generalizable to
pregnant women seeking antenatal care in the Sub Saharan
African region
This study required mothers to recall past event and this
subjected the responses to recall bias To minimize this bias
where mothers could not recall an event they were permit
ted to skip the item on a questionnaire Additionally this
study does not establish causality but rather provides the
strength of association between the outcome variables and
predictors as such interpretations of the findings should be
done carefully

Background Poor pregnancy risk perception ignorance of obstetric risk symptoms and attitudes toward institutional delivery
services are factors that prevent pregnant women from choosing to receive emergency obstetric treatment
Objective To assess pregnancy risk perception attitude towards skilled delivery service and knowledge of obstetric danger signs
and associated factors among pregnant mothers
Methods A cross sectional community based study design was used The pregnant women who participated in this study were
chosen using a multi stage sampling methodology Data were gathered using a pretested questionnaire that was presented by an
interviewer To find independent factors logistic regression analysis was used With a p value of less than which denotes
statistical significance a corresponding confidence interval CI was calculated
Results Pregnancy risk perception was shown to have a lower mean score overall Only of the study participants had high
pregnancy risk perception Over of respondents had a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization In all categories of
obstetric danger signs only respondents or knew what the obstetric danger signs were Maternal age AOR I CI I
maternal education AOR and parity AOR CI were factors affecting knowledge of
obstetric danger signs Pregnancy risk Perception AOR CI and parity AOR CI I were significantly
associated with attitudes on the use of skilled delivery services
Conclusion This study found that pregnant women in rural locations had poor levels of knowledge of obstetric danger sign attitude
toward using skilled delivery services and perception of pregnancy risk The knowledge of obstetric danger indicators among pregnant
women was considerably affected by the mother s age education and parity The perception of pregnancy risk and parity were found
to be substantially associated with attitudes towards skilled delivery services
Keywords pregnancy risk perception pregnant mothers Ethiopia
Background
In too many women died from pregnancy related causes and childbirth related causes Complications during and
after childbirth claimed the lives of close to women Most of these deaths were avoidable and took place
in low income settings Two thirds and one fifth of all maternal deaths occurred in sub Saharan
Africa and Southern Asia respectively Sub Saharan Africa accounted for approximately of all maternal
deaths
Ethiopia is one of the nations most affected by high maternal and newborn deaths Obstetric problems such as
bleeding obstructed labor ruptured uterus pregnancy induced hypertension puerperal infection and unsafe abortions are

Risk perception is the way that individuals judge and assess the hazards to which they may be exposed It appears
that a higher perception of health danger enhances protective motivation thus it is critical to comprehend how people
view health risks how correct these views are and how their perception influences their behaviour High risk pregnant
women s decisions about prenatal care and the care they receive during their pregnancies are greatly influenced by their
risk perception Risk perception is a significant concern particularly during pregnancy when behavioural changes in
health have the potential to affect both the mother and the fetus
Pregnancy related risk perception is a subject that has attracted
