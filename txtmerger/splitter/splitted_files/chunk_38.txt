ults Table tests whether
mothers who gave birth in regions and times affected by the cholera epidemic are
different from the rest of mothers in several observable variables Columns I to of
show that there is no significant correlation between the variation of the epidemic
that we exploit and the maternal educational attainment in years and levels with the
probability of a mother to be illiterate and with mother s age In column we observe
a negative relationship with respect to the probability of the mother of being indige
nous however this correlation attenuates the effect of the epidemic on childhood
mortality since childhood mortality was larger among indigenous mothers exposed
to the epidemic
Columns and of Table test whether access to piped water and a toilet or
cesspit as opposed to open defecation are correlated with the spread of the disease
We find no significant correlation between these variables and the variation of the
epidemic that we exploit Unfortunately we do not have access to variables regarding
sanitation at the time of the epidemic only at the time of the census years after the
epidemic broke up but it is still reassuring to see no significant correlation These
results are maybe unsurprising since at the regional level and over time and at least
in the first year the abruptness and severity of the epidemic as well as the speed
of contagion make the geographical proximity of the regions to the initial cases the
main drivers of the disease
Columns and of Table present other placebos for the correlation with the
number of children born alive per mother and on the size of the cohort of last chil
dren born alive Pregnancy rates could have decreased as a response to the cholera
epidemic We can see however that there is a statistically significant correlation with
the total number children born alive per women but the correlation is positive and
very small This result is not surprising given that most children in our sample were
conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic Moreover we will see below that our
results remain very similar even when we limit the sample to those children born
in the first semester of that is conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic
Finally the exposure to the cholera outbreak while in utero may have reduced the
probability that a family replace a lost child and this in turn would bias our results
on mortality If that were the case exposure to cholera would reduce the number of
all the children born alive and would increase size of the cohort of last children
born alive As we have seen above there is no negative correlation between expo
sure to cholera during the third trimester and the number of all children born alive
nor is there any positive correlation with the size of the cohort of last children
born alive
Finally Table tests whether temperature are rainfall were correlated with the
spread of the disease Column reveals that there is no significant correlation

theless including or not rainfall as a control in our regressions has virtually no
effect in our results except for additional statistical significance in some of our esti
mates The lack of sensitivity of our results to the inclusion on temperature and
rainfall as control variables is in part due to the inclusion of month region fixed
effects in our regressions which diminish the role of seasonal factors on childhood
mortality
We test the sensitivity of our results to other specifications and samples including
children born to women who did not relocate to a different district during the years
preceding the census between and and our results are very similar We
also show that the estimated effect on mortality is concentrated on those children
born in the first half of that is those who were already in utero when the
epidemic broke out Please refer to Tables A and A of the working paper Ritter

As we mentioned in Section a Fuzzy DD approach has two important and
somewhat strong assumptions a stable treatment effect over time and homoge

This exercise shows that the Fuzzy DiD assumptions are too strong for our setting
but the bias seems to go against our results Since our Fuzzy DiD model is more
conservative and it has more statistical power we keep it as the main specification of
the study

ABSTRACT
Background The standard treatment for gestational choriocarcinoma is chemotherapy
Objective To describe the risk of recurrence with expectant management of gestational choriocarcinoma that has
reached a normal human chorionic gonadotropin level after tumor removal without adjuvant chemotherapy
Methods A retrospective multicenter international cohort study was conducted from to involving
gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers with patient s follow up extended until Clinical and
biological data of included patients were extracted from each center s database The inclusion criteria were i
histological diagnosis of gestational choriocarcinoma in any kind of placental tissue retrieved ii spontaneous
normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin level following choriocarcinoma retrieval iii patient did not
receive any oncological treatment for the choriocarcinoma iv and at least months of follow up after the first
human chorionic gonadotropin level normalization
Results Among patients with retrieved gestational choriocarcinoma and whose human chorionic gonado
tropin level normalized without any other oncological therapy none had a recurrence of choriocarcinoma after a
median follow up of months The median interval between choriocarcinoma excision and human chorionic
gonadotropin level normalization was days The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics
World Health Organization risk score was in of the cases
Conclusions This multicenter international study reports that selected patients with gestational choriocarcinoma
managed in gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers did not experience any relapse when the initial
tumor evacuation is followed by human chorionic gonadotropin level normalization without any additional
treatment Expectant management may be a safe approach for highly selected patients

Introduction
Gestational trophoblastic diseases GTD encompass among others
premalignant complete and partial hydatidiform moles and malignant
lesions called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia GTN one of which is
gestational choriocarcinoma GCC GCC is a rare and aggressive GTN
subtype with a high metastatic potential Although most GCC occur after
a molar pregnancy they can also be found after any other kind of
pregnancy i e ectopic pregnancy miscarriage or term delivery The
incidence of GCC is estimated to be approximately
term pregnancies and complete hydatidiform mole
Standard treatment of GCC is chemotherapy with a regimen based
on the tumor s risk profile An International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics FIGO World Health Organization WHO scoring sys
tem based on eight prognostic factors has been established to evaluate
the risk of resistance to single agent chemotherapy Low risk tumors
i e with a FIGO WHO risk score lower or equal to are treated with
single agent chemotherapy whereas high risk tumors i e with a FIG
O WHO risk score higher than are treated with multiagent chemo
therapy Monitoring serum human chorionic gonadotropin hCG is
used as a reliable tumor biomarker
The early initiation of low risk GTN adequate treatment is associated
with a year survival rate of However the histology of
choriocarcinoma is predictive of a decreased effectiveness of first line
single agent treatments compared to post mole GTN It has been
suggested that patients with histopathological evidence of choriocarci
noma and a FIGO WHO risk score of or may benefit from upfront
multiagent chemotherapy in case of pre treatment hCG level
mlU mL or metastatic disease
The diagnostic confirmation of GCC often requires expert histo
pathological review which may delay the final pathological diagnosis
During this reviewing interval hCG level can decline spontaneously and
eventually normalize without additional therapy
The objective of this international study conducted in GTD reference
centers was to assess the recurrence rate of GCC after primary complete
tumor removal followed by hCG normalization without adjuvant
therapy

where required
Patients enrollment
Patients were included in this study if they were diagnosed with GCC
in any kind of pathology specimen second third trimester placenta
product of curettage uterus fallopian tube or metastasis resection
Ovarian choriocarcinomas were included only if molecular genotyping
proved the gestational origin Referent pathologists of each center have
systematically reviewed all initial histological diagnoses At least
normal serum hCG level following GCC removal without any additional
treatment was necessary Patients who received a single methotrexate
injection for an initial context of a suspected ectopic pregnancy prior to
the diagnosis of GCC were not excluded from the study At least
months of follow up at one of the reference centers after the first
normalized hCG level was required
Patients with a previous history of GCC cured by chemotherapy or
patients with non gestational choriocarcinoma were excluded
Patients with metastatic disease were not excluded from the study
Initial workup and management of gestational choriocarcinoma
Along with clinical history and physical examination an initial im
aging workup was performed at the time of GCC diagnosis for the
anatomical staging It was considered complete if it included imaging of
all the following anatomical regions pelvis ultrasound or MRI
abdomen CT scan or ultrasound and chest X ray for FIGO score CT
scan imaging Brain evaluation CT scan or MRI was performed
selectively in women with suspected distant lesions
The FIGO WHO risk score was calculated for each patient based on
available data For the item antecedent pregnancy in the absence of
molecular genotyping we considered either the current term pregnancy
for intraplacental choriocarcinoma or the last known pregnancy When
the patient reported no previous pregnancy we scored missed abortion
by default
For the item interval from index pregnancy we used the interval
between last known pregnancy termination and the excision of
choriocarcinoma
We defined the first hCG value available as the item pre treatment
hCG Since the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma was not suspected at the
time of placental removal in most cases first hCG level was measured
after tumor evacuation for of patients n which may have
underestimated the FIGO WHO risk score

First hCG post evacuation level accounts for
of total variability of necessary time to tumor marker normal

Discussion
Principal findings
This multicentre international study shows no relapses of GCC after
primary complete evacuation followed by hCG level normalization
without any additional treatment These results highlight the opportu
nity to avoid chemotherapy exposure in highly selected patients
Results in the context of published literature
The centralization of care in expert GTD centers has contributed to
the improvement of GCC management in terms of treatment morbidity
and mortality The process of histopathological review in these
reference centers requires time and is associated with a delay between
specimen evacuation final diagnosis of GCC and treatment initiation In
several cases hCG level normalizes within this time interval Manage
ment of patients with normal tumor marker level and no evidence of
residual disease after GCC removal is a particularly controversial issue
Some published data leave open the question whether non
metastatic GCC should be managed with

immediate chemotherapy
Very limited data are available on
the specific subset of patients with normalized hCG level after GCC
evacuation It is not clear if postponing chemotherapy is an
undertreatment
A retrospective study compared expectant management versus im
mediate chemotherapy for low risk and non metastatic GCC In this
population of patients managed by surveillance only achieved
complete sustained remission Interestingly among the cases with
normalized hCG level no patient required chemotherapy which is
concordant with our observation
Regarding the specific condition of intraplacental choriocarcinoma
a systematic review considering non metastatic cases showed no
relapse in out of patients managed by surveillance only
However it is not clear which criteria were applied to decide between
prophylactic chemotherapy or simple surveillance The authors of this
study recommend to avoid adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
non metastatic disease and normal hCG level but lifelong hCG moni
toring is required
The population of the present study is heterogeneous in terms of
pregnancy gestational age first second or third trimester and meta
static status Moreover of patients were older than years old
which is a known risk factor for resistance to monochemotherapy in the
treatment of GCC
The duration of post normalized hCG monitoring is still debated after
chemotherapy for GTN Published data show that most recurrent GTN
appear in the first year of follow up regardless of the FIGO WHO score
risk
Recurrent GCC occurs usually within the years
The
consensus is to follow up patients for at least year after cessation of
therapy though with some centers advocating up to years of
follow up
In the present study the median follow up was
years which is in accordance with practice in most centers and allows
the diagnosis of the vast majority of recurrences
Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study are the multicentric international design
and the involvement of recognized expert trophoblastic diseases centers
with systematic histopathological review This cohort of patients is
the largest cohort available in the literature in this very restricted sub
group of patients
We also acknowledge some limitations such as the retrospective
design FIGO scores were calculated thanks to available data sometimes
without knowing the index pregnancy since genotyping is not routinely
done Our conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution and
the surveillance only decision must be validated in a multidisciplinary
expert GTD center to avoid metastatic disease as a deleterious conse
quence of postponing chemotherapy
Clinical and research implications
Our results highlight the consideration of an expectant approach in
highly selected cases of GCC when the hCG level falls and eventually
normalizes after complete tumor removal especially in early stage Iow
risk disease These results need to be validated in a larger and pro
spective study In the future it may change the FIGO recommendation to
initiate chemotherapy in all cases of GCC histology This management
should always be validated by an experienced team in gestational
trophoblastic reference centers
Conclusions
This international multicenter study shows that patients with a pri
mary diagnosis of GCC managed in GTD reference centers do not relapse
when the initial tumor excision is followed by a normalization of hCG
level without adjuvant treatment These results however should be
interpreted with some reservation as they only concern a selected cohort

ABSTRACT
Background Maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality depend on identifying of pregnancy risks
and risk management There is a dearth of information about the experiences of high risk pregnant
mothers in self mitigation of the risk in the socio cultural setting of Iran This research was conducted
to explore the risk management experiences of high risk pregnant mothers
Methods This Qualitative study was conducted in educational hospitals in Mashhad Iran from July
to December The purposive sampling method was used to recruit the participants based on
medical or obstetric high risk conditions in pregnancy Qualitative data were obtained from in depth
and semi structured interviews Mothers experiences of pregnancy in a risky condition were
asked and the interview continued until data saturation Data were analyzed using the MAXQDA
software and the Elo and method
Results Maternal experiences for risk management in pregnancy were formed by nine sub categories
and three categories the excitement of emotion including feeling worry and despair gladness
in the shadow of hope and optimism momentary shocking and excitement and inactivity and
helplessness self contemplation including active analysis of the ways of moderating the risk
cognitive denial and ignoring the risk and witnessed action including problem focused and
rational actions and avoidance and inefficient engagements
Conclusion Risk management experiences of pregnant women with high risk pregnancies include a
wide range of positive and negative feelings effective and ineffective thoughts and behaviors Mutual
collaboration between mothers and midwives obstetricians by providing high quality risk management
counseling can lead to choosing effective risk management strategies

INTRODUCTION
A high risk pregnancy HRP refers to
pregnancies in which the mother or the fetus has
an increased risk of complications compared to
uncomplicated pregnancies l Besides maternal
death fetal complications e g fetal death
premature delivery low birth weight and other
poor outcomes more likely increase due to
HRP The prevalence ofl IRPs in Iran and other
countries ranges from to In the
past it was not recommended for childbearing
in high risk conditions due to the mother and
baby with more complications Recent advances
in medical treatments have enabled many
women with chronic illnesses to get pregnant
and experience motherhood
Women s risk perception affects decision
making and behavior in pregnancy This
means that mothers must control their
environment diet activity and any risk for
raising their chances of fulfilling the goal of
childbearing A qualitative study of pregnant
women in Iran found that challenges of
family anticipation for motherhood future
pregnancies and challenge of adaptation in
pregnancy were experiences of high risk
pregnant women Many pregnant women with
hypertensive disorders felt that they weren t
well informed of management decisions
and had a desire to be involved in decision
making A study found that thoughts and
feelings about safety the physical environment
and the perceived psychological influence
of the location of birth are the factors that
women consider when deciding on place of
birth process Barriers to management of
diabetes during pregnancy were financial
barriers to maintaining a healthy diet and
exercising communication difficulties lack
of social support and barriers related to
diabetes care ll A grounded theory study has
found becoming the best mom that I can be
is a complex process Women need to rebuild
the self and regain control of their lives This
process needs reorganization of the problem
dealing with their shame and embarrassment
identifying an understanding healthcare
provider and considering the consequences
of the depression and its management A
systematic research finding recommended
that the maternal health experiences should
be highlighted particularly when it comes to
decision making about care
Despite the fact that pregnancy outcome
will be safer with risk management no
qualitative study to investigate management
of risk in high risk pregnant Iranian women
has been conducted in Iran One study
evaluated Risk Management Model of Iran s
Health System According to the Ministry
of Health and Medical Education statistics in
Iran HRPs were cared with standard practice
set by the reference books as a single policy
across Iran HRP management includes
medical interventions and supportive cares
Experiences during HRP have a unique
meaning for the person The researcher s
experience indicates that prenatal care is
carried out based on standards and without
considering the views and opinions of
mothers in Iran Therefore mothers may
not act correctly when the recommendations
and the mother s point of view conflict
which is dangerous for the mother s health
Mother s desire is to preserve the health of
the fetus and herself The experiences and
behaviors of Iranian pregnant women with
regard to the management of HRP remain
mainly unexplored Understanding this matter
and aligning the prenatal care according to
the mother s discretion can be beneficial in
advancing or improving the health of the
mother and the fetus in HRPs The choice
for a qualitative study is its effectiveness in
obtaining the perceptions and experiences and
understanding concerns and feelings of people
with health issues The present qualitative
study was conducted to better understand the
experiences of women with HRP regarding
the management of risk during pregnancy
