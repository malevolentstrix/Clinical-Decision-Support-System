Congenital heart defect is the commonest among the birth defects
affecting millions of children world wide One fifth of children are
likely to have significant problems that necessitate intervention in the
first year of life CHD is a major and fast growing health issue for
children worldwide Because of the severity of disease which affects
the quality of life early detection is a important in order to implement
early intervention A study conducted by Bhambani in which
fetal echo were performed of which women had no risk factor
associated with CHD A total of per fetuses were found
to have some cardiac abnormality of which per had
CHD In our study II fetuses were found to have CHD while
fetuses were found to have functional cardiac abnormalities
While another study from Northern India found incidence of CHD as
per
In a recent study by Qiu X and coworkers evaluated fetal
echocardiography of pregnant women in which fetuses
were found to have CHD Prenatal genetic examination on amniotic
fluid and cord blood revealed chromosomal abnormalities in
of foetuses with CHD Hence they recommended interventional
prenatal genetic evaluation for fetuses with CHD to rule out the
chromosomal abnormalities
A cross sectional study on one hundred and one pregnant
women in Egypt was to determine the clinical utility of fetal
echocardiography FE They performed FE and detected congenital
heart defects CHDs in of which complex cardiac lesions
that were diagnosed included common atrioventricular canal cardiac
masses fetal arrhythmias and cono truncal anomalies Later they
performed postnatal transthoracic echocardiography on neonates
and concluded that fetal echo can accurately diagnose majority of
the complex lesions but can miss few critical defects like aortic
coarctation
A retrospective analysis on fetal echocardiography of
studied various referral indications like abnormal anatomy
scans maternal medical disorders family history of CHD and fetus
growth restrictions They reported CHD in of the fetuses They
also performed prenatal invasive testing and reported chromosomal
abnormalities in of the CHD detected foetuses In their study
they concluded that most CHDs occur during pregnancy even without
any underlying prenatal risk factor emphasising the importance of
routine foetal echocardiography scans and finding the association
between CHD and chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses
In our study the majority of referrals had a primary indication as
gestational diabetes mellitus However only of them were
detected to have CHD in their fetuses and the association between
gestational diabetes mellitus and CHD detection was not found to be
statistically significant p value Also of the referrals
had pregestational DM but none of their fetuses were found to have
CHD in them et al did a cohort study of two million births
over years and found a four fold increase in the risk of CHDs
in maternal pre gestational DM both types I and In a systemic
review Depla et al found that maternal diabetes Pregestational and
gestational is associated with fetal cardiac hypertrophy ventricular
diastolic dysfunction and overall impaired myocardial performance
This observation in our study is different from other studies where
majority of CHD is diagnosed in mothers with diabetes this might
be due to small sample size and association may be detected if we
had enrolled more numbers of mothers with diabetes especially with
pregestational diabetes
The second most common primary indication among referrals was
hypothyroidism and CHD was found in of their fetuses
Although the association between hypothyroidism and the detection
of CHD was not found to be significant enough p value
However a study by Grattanet showed CHD in of fetuses of
mothers having hypothyroidism suggesting a significant correlation
between maternal hypothyroidism and the development of CHD in
the fetus
Total of of the women were referred with the indication of
polyhydramnios of their fetuses were found to have CHD
and the association was not significant Polyhydramnios

ABSTRACT
Background Women with disabilities have the same rights as women without disabilities to prevent
unintended pregnancy yet little is known about their experiences in accessing family planning methods
Objective This qualitative descriptive study explored perceptions of barriers to effective family planning
services among women with disabilities
Method Semi structured open ended interviews were conducted with women with diverse dis
abilities as part of a larger study investigating risks and facilitators of unintended pregnancy among
women with disabilities across the United States
Results Analysis revealed multiple barriers experienced by women with disabilities in accessing effec
tive family planning services needed to prevent unintended pregnancy Barriers included physical or
system barriers financial limitations and nonresponsive healthcare providers Women also identified
difficulties in finding appropriate family planning methods both related and unrelated to disability
Conclusions This is the first in depth exploration of barriers to accessing family planning services and
challenges to finding effective family planning options among women with disabilities The findings
underscore the need for targeted interventions improved provider training and policy changes to
optimize reproductive healthcare improve access to family planning services and prevent unintended
pregnancy among women of childbearing age with diverse disabilities

unintended pregnancy as compared to White women and in
dividuals with higher incomes in the U S
Less studied is unintended pregnancy among women living
with disabilities Nearly of U S women of childbearing age live
with a disability Women with disabilities are increasingly
becoming pregnant and may be as likely to become pregnant as
women without disabilities Further women with disabilities are
as likely to report wanting to have a child as women without dis
abilities yet less certain about future pregnancy intentions Few
studies have examined unintended pregnancy among women with
disabilities Using Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring
System PRAMS data from Rhode Island researchers found women
with disabilities were significantly less likely to intend to become
pregnant than women without disability More recently using
data from the and waves of the National
Survey of Family Growth NSFG significant differences in preg
nancy intention were noted by disability status Specifically a
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
higher proportion of pregnancies were unintended among women
with disabilities as compared to women without disabilities i e
vs respectively and women reporting an independent
living disability had the highest proportion of unintended preg
nancies An examination by disability type revealed signifi
cantly higher adjusted odds of unintended pregnancies among
women with hearing disability cognitive disability and indepen
dent living disability than for pregnancies among women without
disabilities aOR Yet the reason for these disparities
remains largely unknown Using NSFG data researchers examined
population based estimates of use of family planning services
among women of reproductive age Findings revealed women with
disabilities were less likely to receive any family planning services
than women without disabilities and these disparities were most
pronounced in women reporting low education low income and
unemployment Additional analyses revealed among women ages
those living with disabilities were significantly less likely to
have received a method of birth control or birth control counseling
in the previous twelve months as compared to those without a
disability
There is a growing body of literature demonstrating substantial
inequities in the quality of healthcare received including experi
encing stigma and bias among women with disabilities Much of
this literature is focused on experiences during pregnancy with less
recognition of the critical importance of the preconception period
and its influence on subsequent pregnancy outcomes The quality
of care women with disabilities experience outside of pregnancy
care may be associated with an increased risk of unintended
pregnancy In a qualitative study of women living with spina bifida
women reported having a poor understanding of their pregnancy
potential in part due to insufficient information from healthcare
providers Another qualitative study focused on women living
with disabilities who experienced reproductive coercion found
that health care providers rarely screened for violence a known
risk factor for unintended pregnancy Attitudes and practices of
neurology providers regarding sexual and reproductive healthcare
for their adolescent and young adult patients with epilepsy were
recently explored with results demonstrating wide variability
among practitioners With regard to reproductive goals one
physician noted telling a patient not to get pregnant until you re
like and another physician describing telling women not to get
pregnant until they are transferred to adult neurology and then the
discussion can ensue regarding reproductive goals Ensuring ac
cess to effective family planning methods is critical to preventing
unintended pregnancy particularly for women with disabilities
who may face unique barriers to care Thus the purpose of the
current study was to explore perceptions of barriers to family
planning services among women living with disabilities
Methods
The current study reports the qualitative findings of a mixed
method parent study that examined risks and protective factors for
unintended pregnancy among US women living with diverse dis
abilities including those with hearing disability vision disability
cognitive disability mobility disability self care disability and in
dependent living disability The quantitative aims of the parent
study utilized data from two waves of the NSFG while the quali
tative aim explored women s experiences with reproductive health
care as well as the context of their unintended pregnancies Eligi
bility for participation in the qualitative aim reported here
included women between the ages of and who experienced
an unintended pregnancy after the onset of a disability experi
enced an unintended pregnancy within the prior two years and
reported the presence of a disability for at least two years at the
Disability and Health Journal
time of data collection Women were excluded if they were unable
to answer simple questions demonstrative of understanding of the
informed consent did not understand or express themselves in
English or American Sign Language lived in a nursing home or
other institution reported severe misuse of alcohol or other drugs
or expressed suicidal ideation The study was approved by the
University of Virginia Institutional Review Board
Given our goal to explore the experiences of women living with
diverse disabilities across the US we used multiple dissemination
methods to reach our population of interest Primary dissemination
methods included social media including Facebook groups and
individual social media platforms of individuals actively engaged in
the disability community disability related websites and
community based organizations Our study included a community
advisory board CAB comprised of nine individuals who identified
as women living with diverse disabilities living in different areas of
the US Our CAB was instrumental in our recruitment efforts using
their well established networks to disseminate study related
information
The qualitative aim of the parent study included women
living with a disability Four women were excluded due to having a
planned pregnancy n or the onset of a disability after expe
riencing an unintended pregnancy n The individual in depth
interviews were guided by a semi structured interview guide
which was developed by the study team in conjunction with our
CAB The interview guide drew upon findings generated from
quantitative findings in the parent study
Areas of exploration
included participants knowledge of family planning options
health care providers advice around family planning and their
perceptions on unique risks for experiencing an unintended
pregnancy
Data collection
The first author who has extensive clinical and research expe
rience working with women with disabilities conducted all of the
interviews in English over the phone and three participants used
telephone relay services for interview completion Phone in
terviews were necessary given this was a national sample On
average the interviews lasted h Prior to beginning each inter
view participants were reminded that they could skip or refuse to
answer any questions For participants who agreed to have in
terviews recorded the interviewer reminded them that the
recording be turned off during any portion of the interview Addi
tionally each participant was given a code word prior to the start of
the interview that they could use if they felt that their privacy was
in jeopardy given the sensitive nature of the topic Our safety plan
included thanking the participant for her time and ending the call
with the understanding that the participant would re contact the
interviewer at her convenience when her privacy could be main
tained if the code word was used This was not necessary in any of
the interviews conducted Three participants asked that their in
dividual interviews not be recorded though allowed ample time for
the interviewer to record comprehensive notes
Data analysis
Twenty eight of the interviews were audio recorded in full
and transcribed verbatim The three remaining interviews included
comprehensive notes regarding the interview including direct
quotes where appropriate ATLAS it software was used to assist in
the organization and management of data Two authors JA TB
analyzed transcripts using a thematic analysis approach which
started with an immersion in the participants experiences and the
development and refinement of a codebook which included
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
deductive codes derived from the interview guide as well as
inductive codes constructed from the transcripts
To ensure
consistency of findings an audit trail was maintained for trans
parency in the analytic phase During regular meetings with the
study team codes were collapsed refined and removed as
appropriate and any discrepancies in coding were discussed and
resolved via consensus The first two authors organized interview
text pertaining to the experience of unintended pregnancy into
themes and subthemes and matrix analysis was used to identify
similarities and differences among participants The entire study
team reviewed and refined themes and subthemes during research
meetings As a final step the first author reviewed each transcript
to ensure that appropriate coded exemplars were included in the
analysis and that appropriate themes had been identified
Using this thematic analysis approach we identified two major
themes including barriers to accessing family planning and the
unique considerations regarding family planning for women living
with disabilities With regards to barriers to accessing family
planning subthemes included barriers related to physical or sys
tem financial and healthcare provider

Barriers to accessing family planning
The first major theme related to disabled women s experiences
with family planning relates to the substantial and numerous
barriers to access that participants had to overcome to obtain
reproductive health care With one exception all participants re
ported barriers to obtaining family planning services and these
barriers were associated with an increased risk of experiencing an
unintended pregnancy Categories within this theme include
physical and financial barriers and healthcare providers who fail to
address disabled women s reproductive healthcare issues or even
seemingly to recognize that they have need of such care
Physical or system barriers kind of normal and natural in my
world
Participants spoke poignantly about physical or system level
barriers to care specific in accessing family planning services
Inaccessible medical equipment such as a lack of accessible exam
tables or wheelchairs to assist with longer distances e g from
parking lot to clinic as well as more system level barriers were
experienced by many One participant reported having to meet her
health care provider in an emergency room or obstetrical ward for
even routine care remarking I ve never been able to access care in
the same manner that other women would The clinic where her
provider saw patients did not have an accessible exam table for
routine examinations Several other women relayed experiences of
having to obtain routine care in non routine settings due to
accessibility issues These additional complexities in accessing care
often resulted in delayed or missed appointments with one
participant noting I should have had them l didn t want to go
through the hassle I ve probably done them less frequently than
recommended A Deaf participant faced challenges in obtaining
adequate information on birth control because poorly skilled or
unavailable interpreters added an additional barrier to navigate
She remarked the doctor didn t really explain all the other options
to me I think if the interpreter that had been there had been
doing a better job and was more interactive and more clear I would
have known and it just would have been more accessible infor
mation and then I could have made a better choice She further
described that she stopped her birth control method due to
breakthrough bleeding and was not aware of other options
A subtler physical barrier to care was that women were often
dependent on caregivers to take them to appointments or assist
with transfers During adolescence and young adulthood these
caregivers were often parents and thus conversations around
sexual activity and the potential for family planning options could
not freely be discussed A woman with a spinal cord injury
described how she felt her mother s presence at her appointments
kept her from being able to talk openly about her sexual health
recounting I was so dependent on her after my accident she had
to drive me everywhere When I wanted to have my first gyne
cological exam she had to help me onto the exam table and she
stayed in the room and everything So in a way she had control
because she had to be there if I wanted to receive care Similarly
another young woman living with multiple sclerosis was accom
panied to her appointments by her mother While she wanted to
ask her healthcare provider about family planning options she was
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
not comfortable doing so in front of her mother remarking so I
guess that was definitely a barrier I couldn t get the information I
needed and that s how I ended up pregnant Similar experiences
were described by multiple other participants that is wanting to
have open conversations with health care providers but in private
without a family member present
Financial limitations often times I don t come up with the money
Over half of study participants reported significant financial
challenges which also presented barriers to obtaining recom
mended reproductive health care As one participant said
another thing is the cost of these medications If you want an IUD
it s very expensive so and who knows how the insurance is going to
change when it comes to birth control Financial barriers led
another participant to use a less effective birth control methods
i e withdrawal She remarked I m sexually active and well I
haven t gone through her yet because I do have a co pay to go see
her and often times I don t come up with the money to see her
Similarly another woman reported becoming pregnant soon after
giving birth when she could not afford to attend her six week
checkup More than half of study participants reported living on
per year total household income and as one participant
stated when it comes to choosing groceries or co pays I have to
choose food A substantial number of participants also identified
obstacles including significant delays in finding a healthcare pro
vider who could attend to their reproductive health needs given
their disability Participants perceived these delays were exacer
bated by a shortage of health care providers who accepted their
insurance i e Medicaid One participant who had recently moved
to a new town described significant delays in attempting to obtain
an intrauterine device She recalled by the time I found someone
who was comfortable treating me living with spinal cord injury
they saw me and said I needed to come back to have the IUD ve
always felt like having Medicaid and this disability is it s like a
double whammy She went on to describe feeling judged in
many of her encounters with the health care system due to
Medicaid and that having Medicaid limited her options in health
care providers who were willing to care for her This experience of
feeling judged based upon payer status was shared by several other
participants Ultimately she experienced an unintended pregnancy
due to delays in finding a healthcare provider with whom she was
comfortable receiving care
Healthcare providers it was the silence around the topic that was
most telling
All participants were asked about their experiences with
healthcare providers in discussing and accessing family planning
options to prevent an unintended pregnancy While few partici
pants were actively discouraged from being sexually active by
healthcare providers many perceived that their providers were
highly reluctant to raise the issue during the health care
appointment Some participants found healthcare providers quick
to assume that they were not in need of contraception as adoles
cents One participant with a physical disability recounted seeing
her family physician before she went to college and her mother
being in the exam room She described the encounter with her
physician recalling she was like going down this checklist and I
remember her clicking through and going well you re not sexually
active so that s a no Most of the participants who were older and
in some cases had already experienced an unintended pregnancy
reported that their providers also failed to address the topic Par
ticipants very clearly felt this was due to their disability As one
participant said It s the truth She provider absolutely didn t talk
Disability and Health Journal
to me about it because of my disability Another said I guess she
didn t talk about contraception because of my disability She had
seen me for like the last five years and it never came up It was like
that whole section was just skipped over Some participants dis
cussed having never had a sexual history taken or had a provider
ask about their family planning needs A participant who used a
wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury noted no one ever asked if I
wanted to be pregnant or if I didn t want to be pregnant Another
participant who was Deaf remarked I did go to a GYN almost every
year because I knew I was supposed to but it was never brought
up Participants often attributed this to a view of women with
disability as asexual A participant living with multiple sclerosis
remarked persons with disabilities are special but not in special
way People don t think we re interested in sex or maybe it s that
who would be interested in having sex with me A participant
with a spinal cord injury described her experience in discussing
family planning options noting it was more like she didn t believe
because I have a disability that I could have intercourse So she
wasn t too worried about it even though I actually expressed my
concerns about it she was definitely dismissive Another added
there was also this underlying assumption that it contraception
was only to help with my periods like I d never need it for birth
control that question never ever came up Yeah no one has ever
asked me if I was sexually active
When asked what they knew about contraception prior to
experiencing an unintended pregnancy participants reported a
range of knowledge and any unique considerations given their
specific disability For those participants who were older some
described being placed in separate classrooms as school aged
children for the birds and the bees talk now recounting that the
discussions were more focused on anatomy than anything else
Younger participants described largely turning to family friends or
social media for information Overall participants felt supported in
their discussions with family and friends and rarely were partici
pants discouraged from being sexually active or using contracep
tion Those who were discouraged from using contraception as
adolescents or young adults n
were most commonly
discouraged because of concerns from family members about po
tential side effects of varied methods With few exceptions the
majority of participants did not receive information during
adolescence and young adulthood about reproductive health care
needs from a health care provider unless they initiated the
conversation
Finding what works for me
The second major theme was related to difficulties participants
experienced in finding family planning options that worked for
their individual needs
Like women without disabilities many participants struggled to
find a family planning method that worked for them and that they
liked The information under this theme reflects those struggles
and the factors that influenced participants experience with family
planning including side effects and problems with methods both
unrelated and related to disability Many participants perceived
providers were often not helpful in providing them with guidance
in navigating their challenges with methods
Women with disabilities in this study often encountered the
same kinds of challenges with contraception that women without
disabilities typically report For example participants experienced
side effects like weight gain mood swings or diminished sex drive
from hormonal methods or had difficulty remembering to take oral
contraceptives For some typical side effects e g fatigue dimin
ished desire were particularly difficult to manage in the context of
disabilities that were already causing such symptoms For others
J L Alhusen T Bloom K Laughon et al
the side effects impacted them more severely because of their
disabilities One participant shared The reason I was concerned
about my weight gain with different options was because of my
disability I struggle with mobility as it is and so I have to really be
careful about anything that could cause me to gain weight it
would wear on my shoulders to push myself if I got heavier and
transferring would be harder Many had to try multiple methods
because of side effects that were more problematic given their
disability One participant with a physical disability noted I got on
the pill and I did fine until I d been on it for about six months and I
noticed I started gaining weight having horrible headaches having
horrible mood swings and it was just awful and I couldn t tolerate
it and so we tried a diaphragm later I had decided to get my
tubes tied because I did have one abortion and it haunted me
For some participants their specific disabilities affected their
physiologic responses to contraception thus limiting their options
For example one participant with a genetic metabolic condition
reported an idiosyncratic reaction to an injectable contraceptive
that caused her to gain a large amount of weight and resulted in
hospitalization Participants with mobility issues e g paraplegia
were unable to safely use hormonal methods due to poor circula
tion and an increased risk of blood clots One participant described
her challenges when her provider recommended a NuvaRing given
her concerns of not wanting something she had to take every day
She remarked I couldn t use the ring because I can t bend with my
back to insert that in and I know people who have mobility issues
that bending to insert that would be impossible for them too
Several participants described wanting to explore an intrauterine
device IUD as an option given their desire for menstrual man
agement or suppression as well as desire for a method without
estrogen due to its association with an increased risk for throm
bosis Participants with mobility limitations described not being
able to tolerate the positioning required for IUD insertion yet op
tions to have this done under anesthesia were not discussed
Several participants with weakness or limited use in their upper
or lower extremities felt their options were quite limited and did
not perceive providers to be sensitive to these needs The providers
often offered little information and few options leaving partici
pants to feel they had been left alone to identify alternatives when a
particular method did not work for them As one said it s almost
like it was my problem to deal with not theirs Another participant
with a cognitive disability remarked that she had difficulty
remembering to take her birth control pills When she broached the
topic with her provider she said she didn t offer anything She told
me for it to be effective I needed to take it every day which I knew
but just wasn t good at remembering I knew there might be some
other options but it was this is your option take it or leave it
Another participant with a physical disability reported it was like
she wasn t interested in talking about it She had made her
recommendation and it didn t work so that was that Minimizing
menstruation was a particularly important consideration for par
ticipants with limited mobility One participant who self
catheterized hoped that minimizing her periods would decrease
her frequent urinary tract infections Another reported periods
were also harder for me because I can t stand to clean myself up and
so absolutely I was looking for an option that would not make me
gain weight and that would cut back on my bleeding substantially
Discussion
The reproductive health needs of women living with disabilities
have largely been ignored
Unintended pregnancy is regarded
as a key indicator of women s autonomy and control over their
reproductive health and is a marker widely used in policy and
program planning Limited research demonstrates that rates of
Disability and Health Journal
unintended pregnancy are higher among women with disabilities
who are also disproportionately poor less educated and racial and
ethnic minorities reflecting both historical harms and existing
inequities
The barriers that women with disabilities face in accessing
family planning are substantial In this study most participants
identified the combination of financial restriction and health in
surance limitations as a barrier to accessing optimal reproductive
services and family planning options Overcoming this inequity
barrier will involve solutions such as greater employment oppor
tunities equal pay and attitudinally and physically accessible work
environments for women with disabilities as well as comprehen
Sive health insurance reform Many of our participants also
described physical barriers which either precluded or delayed ac
cess to care Improving access to care will require elimination of
such barriers A study examining physical access barriers found that
of gynecological practices were deemed inaccessible to women
with disabilities Despite the passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act thirty years ago women with disabilities continue
to experience barriers in accessibility Many of our participants
discussed examination tables being a limiting factor to care The
U S Access Board established standards for accessible equipment
including adjustable height examination tables yet widespread
adoption of these standards has not occurred Women living with
disability are more likely to be poor and many of the participants in
this study had Medicaid While Medicaid is meant to increase ac
cess to care for participants in this study it was often perceived as
yet another barrier Other research in women without disabil
ities has found that Medicaid recipients often experience
Stigma is associated with less utilization of preventa
stigma
tive care delays in seeking care and lower quality of care
While the experience of stigma was not a central purpose of the
current study our findings suggest it may be an important risk
factor for unintended pregnancy for women living with disability of
reproductive age
Beyond physical and financial barriers women experienced
negative and nonresponsive encounters with healthcare providers
many of whom treated them with negative attitudes or frank
dismissal of their reproductive health care needs and parenting
desires The large majority noted that discussions around fertility
desires occurred only if the women raised the issue and even then
some women felt judged In a qualitative study of pregnant
women with physical disabilities women perceived being treated
as less than normal and in some cases feeling viewed as a
problem by their clinicians A patient centered approach is key
to optimizing reproductive choices It is important for clinicians to
recognize that women with disabilities are fully sexual beings with
the same range of fertility and parenting desires and concerns as
their able bodied peers Addressing sexuality and contraception is
an essential part of the clinical encounter This is particularly salient
for women with disabilities who have been historically regarded as
asexual
Assessing fertility goals and contraceptive counseling are dis
cussions that must occur in a patient centered approach to opti
mizing reproductive choices
Engaging women in such
discussions is increasingly recognized as key public health strategy
to decrease rates of unintended pregnancy Indeed the American
Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG along with a
number for health care organizations advocates for reproductive
life planning in health care settings recognizing its role in
reducing unintended pregnancy improving maternal health and
pregnancy outcomes
Family planning presents unique considerations for women
living with disabilities Despite recent research showing the ther
apeutic benefit and safety of levonorgestrel IUD use in young adults

Reproductive Health in
the Time of COVID
Jennifer Berglund
IN SPRING the pandemic began shutting
down the world restaurants colleges even entire
cities felt emptied and closed A cloud of uncertainty
lingered over most parts of the world and altered our
daily schedules and tasks But for a wide segment of
society it wasn t the toilet paper or the masks or the
isolation from their families that hurt the worst it
was the sudden uncertainty around one of the most
fundamental aspects of our lives reproduction
Quite suddenly with the onset of the pandemic
this process already fraught with dangers and ques
tions and challenges became infinitely more so
Hard data was already scarce in an active novel
pandemic and for pregnancy even more so In
some cases the answer became delay or cancel any
family plans Birth rates already on the decrease
abruptly plummeted in the United States According
to a recent survey by the Guttmacher Institute
of American women have either delayed their plans
to have a child or reduced the number of children
they expect to have as a result of the pandemic
For those who elected to move forward they
faced an environment of heightened risk Rates of
maternal deaths stillbirths ruptured ectopic preg
nancies and maternal depression shot up around
the world during the pandemic Health offi
cials are scrambling to understand if this is directly
related to the virus or just a byproduct of a global
health care system stretched to the brink In the
meantime both women and men intentionally and
not continue to make and have babies navigating
the winding path of conception pregnancy and
birth all in an active pandemic However there are
still many more questions and few certainties when
it comes to nurturing new life

Making babies
One of the more intriguing questions about the
COVID pandemic is the fact that from the start it
has hit men harder than women Maleness is in fact
the leading risk factor for both contracting the virus
and developing severe illness once infected This
is due to the prevalence a protein found on
the surface of many types of cells that acts as the
receptor for COVID s spike protein Though
is found in both men and women a lot of it is found
in the testes more in fact than in any other organ
male or female That has reproductive health
specialists concerned that the virus might impact
sperm production In fact COVID s viral
cousin SARS or SARS CoV is known to cause wide
spread damage to both the sperm and testes when it
invades causing severe inflammation and cell death
and aside from that it isn t unusual for sperm
production to suffer during a fever inducing illness
Sarah Vij a urological surgeon and male fertility
specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland OH
said that recently ill men are routinely advised not to
undergo fertility treatments due to inevitable drops
in sperm counts Figure Anecdotally she said
I ve seen two patients
and my partner has seen
one who were recover
ing or recently infected
with COVID who had no
sperm in their ejaculate
she said but it s unclear
whether or not this is a
prolonged issue or merely
temporary The data sim
ply do not exist to suggest
either way

cousin SARS or
SARS CoV is known
to cause wide

Similar increases have been seen throughout the
world The massive influx of severely ill COVID
patients has also pushed pregnant women in these
areas out of the hospital limiting their access to
critical prenatal care leading to thousands of
deaths that would have been avoided under differ
ent circumstances
Protecting babies
Early in the pandemic it was unclear if women
could transmit the virus to their babies during
pregnancy or at birth Perhaps out of an overabun
dance of caution the initial policy in China was for
a newborn to be immediately removed from a COV
ID mother and then kept in isolation for as long as
days without breastmilk That draconian process
was not something any of us wanted to replicate
said Puopolo but we were in an evidence free zone
Prior to the pandemic Puopolo had been work
ing on a study investigating immunity transfer from
mother to child for Group B Streptococcus one of
the leading causes of sepsis in newborns By com
paring antibody levels in the umbilical cord blood of
newborns to those in the mother s blood they could
get a pretty good idea of the rate of transfer from the
mother through the placenta When the pandemic
hit it was easy to adjust their protocol to test for
those antibodies instead As newborn providers
we wanted a way to tell a woman she doesn t have to
worry anymore she said if you have to tell a family
with a new baby t
