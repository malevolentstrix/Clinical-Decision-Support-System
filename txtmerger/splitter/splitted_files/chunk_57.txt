explainable
Explainability provides insights into the decision making process of
the machine learning based CDSSs There are two types of explanation
methods ante hoc and post hoc methods Ante hoc methods involve de
veloping machine learning models that are inherently transparent such
as linear and logistic regression decision tree and kNN They reveal
the decision logic to users and are referred to as white box models
When non explainable black box algorithms ANNs SVMs random
forests etc are used the models developed can be explained in a
post hoc manner Post hoc methods generate approximations of the de
cision logic of the models Post hoc explanations can be split into global
explanations which provide an overall understanding into a model s
behavior and local explanations which explain why a particular deci
sion output is made

black box machine learning models for CDSSs for pregnancy care

Discussion
Machine learning based CDSSs have been developed to assist clini
cians in various stages and aspects of pregnancy care from preconcep
tion to postpartum stages The main focus is on supporting diagnosis
prognosis and treatment for both pregnant women and babies during
pregnancy and childbirth The limited number n
of publica
tions towards the development of machine learning based CDSSs for
pregnancy care suggests that it is still an under explored area How
ever there is an increase in the number of studies in this field in recent
years partly because of the rise in research studying cardiotocography
data using machine learning
As explainability is becoming increasingly prominent for systems
it was of interest to identify to what extent these studies incorporated
this element in their work CDSS explainability has the potential to
enhance the clinicians trust towards the system
l while high
accuracy alone is insufficient especially as it is often achieved by
complex and opaque models Arrieta et al have recommended that
black box models should be selected only when necessary and the use
of white box models should be prioritised over complex algorithms that
require the application of post hoc XAI techniques The use of black
box models is prevalent in machine learning based CDSSs for pregnancy
care especially in the past few years Although there is an increasing de
mand to make approaches explainable in medicine an overall lack of
explainability and application of XAI methods is observed in this field
More than half of the CDSSs are not explainable A small proportion
used white box algorithms and only one paper used a model specific
post hoc explanation to explain black box machine learning models
globally Besides it comes to our attention that Du et al
provided
both post hoc global and local explanations in a web based CDSS for
the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus which was published af
ter the literature search of this review With recent user studies showing
the importance of XAI in CDSSs future researchers in related
fields should consider incorporating explainability into the system de
sign Also it is recommended in the World Health Organisation WHO
Guidelines for Health
There is a lack of awareness or specification of the cultural eth
nic racial groups in the training data Most studies used data collected
in a single centre or multiple centres within the same country This
is likely to reflect the local population and limits the diversity of par
ticipants As machine learning is data based it could limit the appli
cability and validity of the CDSSs on other populations This calls for
cross cultural ethnic racial validation of the CDSSs to evaluate system
generalisability in difference populations and studies on more diverse
populations If the former is not possible researchers should report
the cultural ethnic racial distribution or bias in the data and clearly
specify the applicability of the CDSSs in case of misuse Additionally
when reporting clinical trials involving interventions of an Al machine
learning based CDSS the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials
Artificial Intelligence CONSORT call for descriptions of how
input data for the CDSS are acquired and the populations for which
CDSS intervention can be safely implemented This applies to machine
learning based CDSSs not only in the context of pregnancy care but
also in other medical fields
Although several studies have addressed major unmet needs in
the area of pregnancy care with the use of machine learning mod
els for CDSS development we identified that their research has in
most cases remained experimental In addition only a very limited
amount of machine learning based CDSSs have been tested by clini
cal users Nonetheless in these studies positive feedback was received
regarding reducing diagnostic errors supporting diagnosis and treat
ments and reducing clinicians workload This highlights the potential
of such systems in improving healthcare delivery especially in rural ar
eas where the healthcare practitioners might not be specialists
For future researchers who aim to test machine learning based CDSSs in
International Journal of Medical Informatics
randomised trials it is recommended to follow the CONSORT
and report the trials in a transparent and complete manner
In this work we identified several aspects that require attention in
order for machine learning based CDSSs to transfer into clinical use In
addition to those there are other persisting challenges including miss
ing values outliers and class imbalance These issues are
common in medical datasets and need to be addressed appropriately
We comprehensively reviewed CDSSs incorporating machine learn
ing techniques for pregnancy care Many of our findings are aligned
with previous reviews in related fields Davidson et al identified
limited external validation in in maternal healthcare Dhombres et
al found a lack of external validation and the fact that the contri
butions of remain at the level of proof of concept in the use of in
the obstetrics and gynecology domain Davidson et al discovered
a lack of clinical adoption in the use of and machine learning to im
prove pregnancy outcomes Drukker et al pointed out challenges
with black box models and the absence of wide scale multi centre clin
ical studies in the use of in ultrasound imaging in obstetrics and
gynecology These indicate that the gaps we identified have implica
tions on a broader context providing guidelines for future researchers
The contributions of our review are highlighted by a novel focus
on machine learning based CDSSs an area that endeavors to trans
late machine learning studies into clinical application and an in depth
analysis of explainability cultural ethnic racial bias system implemen
tation and user testing The literature search was conducted on Google
Scholar an academic search engine with a high level of comprehen
siveness As opposed to Dhombres et al who focused on obstetrics
and gynecology core journals only many of the papers we selected
were published in multidisciplinary journals of computer science and
medicine giving a more extensive overview of relevant literature
One of the limitations of this review is that the studies that were
not written in English or not accessible were excluded Additionally
the use of pregnancy as a search keyword may have led to the omis
Sion of some papers that focus on preconception and postpartum care
Nevertheless this review provides valuable insight into the state of the
art in this field and the aspects that require further research guiding
future researchers in related fields
Conclusion
This systematic review comprehensively reviewed and summarised
studies towards the development of CDSSs using machine learning for
different aspects of pregnancy care It is observed that black box algo
rithms are the most popular especially in recent years while the need
for explainability in the models or systems is not sufficiently addressed
We discovered that there is an overall lack of awareness experimen
tation external validation and discussion around culture ethnicity or
race and a lack of CDSS implementation and user testing Despite
the open problems that remain positive feedback from clinicians was
reported on the CDSSs that were tested reinforcing the potential of
such systems to improve clinical practice Our findings can serve as
guidelines for future researchers in related fields to assist them in in
corporating their work in clinical practice and having a higher impact
in the delivery of personalised care

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Introductiorr Barriers to family planning for potential clients have been explored in the literature but rarely from
the perspective of the women themselves in a low income setting This research aimed to understand clients
perspectives on being turned away from receiving a method of family planning at a facility on the day it was
sought
Methods Three focus group discussions were held in two districts of Malawi in with clients who had been
turned away approximately three to six months prior
Results The reasons for turnaway participants mentioned fell into eight categories no proof of not being preg
nant method and or supply stock outs arriving late provider unavailable provider refusal needing to wait
longer after delivery of a child financial constraints and medical reasons Participants were often turned away
more than once before finally being able to initiate a method in some cases returning to the same facility and in
others finding it through community health workers traditional healers or private facilities Clients often
resorted to sleeping apart from their husbands until they could initiate a method and reported stress and worry
resulting from being turned away
Conclusions Clients are turned away without a method of FP on the day they seek one for multiple reasons nearly
all of which are preventable Many examples given by the participants showed a lack of knowledge and respect
for clients on the part of the providers Changing attitudes and behaviour however may be difficult and will
require additional steps Increasing the availability and use of pregnancy tests having a more reliable supply of
methods and materials increasing the number of providers including those trained well in all methods and
providing daily FP services would all help reduce turnaway Improved access to family planning will help
counties achieve their Sustainable Development Goals
The importance of high quality family planning FP services in
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs cannot be under
estimated Traditionally recognised for its role in maternal and child
health FP also contributes to the success of the SDGs in eliminating
extreme poverty increasing health and well being ensuring quality
education for all and lessening the impact of climate change among
others

women in low and middle income countries were estimated to have an

encounter other barriers after arriving at the facility resulting in them
being turned away without receiving a method Those FP barriers that
have been frequently categorised in the literature include geographic
e g long distances between clients and services financial e g un
affordable methods services or transportation to obtain a method and
medical barriers Bertrand et al Campbell et al Starrs
Medical barriers can include non medically necessary
et al
policies or practices that inappropriately prevent clients from receiving
the contraceptive method of their choice or impose unnecessary process
barriers to access family planning services Bertrand et al
For
example a medical barrier could include requiring direct observation of
menstruation i e a soiled menstrual pad to rule out pregnancy lab
tests or vaccinations Campbell et al Stanback et al
Brunie et al Hazel et al
Clients may also face barriers due
to a lack of information on how FP or particular methods work
stock outs of supplies or methods or bias on the part of providers Solo
and Festin Campbell et al Bertrand et al
In the case of provider bias providers may require clients to be
married or of a certain age or they may impose their own beliefs
regarding ideal family size or spacing of pregnancies including limiting
the use of contraception for nulliparous women or women who have had
fewer than the socially accepted number of children Campbell et al
Stanback and Twum Baah Tavrow et al Tumlinson
Providers may also determine the method dispensed to a
et al
client based on ease of initiation or availability of supplies rather than
client preference Solo and Festin Farmer et al Hasselback
et al
Many of the barriers to FP are related to the social determinants of
health including economic status area of residence education social
inclusion and non discrimination and access to affordable quality
health care Marmot et al These are defined by the WHO as
non medical factors that influence health outcomes World Health
Organization Marmot et al While social determinants of
health exist in countries of all income levels they can be harder to
overcome in low and middle income countries where resources and
alternatives are more limited
World Health Organization
Overcoming or minimizing the impact of social determinants of health is
a key element in helping the world to meet the SDGs and achieving
equity in health yet their presence can be noted in many of the afore
mentioned barriers to FP
United Nations
The term turnaway was first used by researchers exploring access to
abortion services in the United States from Biggs et al
In the Tavrow at al showed that many
Foster
Malawian women were denied FP at the facility entrance before even
seeing a provider for reasons including missing group counselling
coming on a non family planning day provider unavailability and un
availability of commodities Tavrow et al More than two de
cades later further research showed that Malawian women were still
being turned away from FP services for reasons including refusing other
services such as an HIV test or vaccination or a facility being closed
during normal operating hours
Hazel et al
Turnaway in Malawi
also resulted from closures or understaffing of facilities long wait times
stock out of methods preferred by the women or FP being offered only
on certain days of the week Peterson et al
Unlike evidence on the presence and types of barriers to accessing FP
facing women evidence on the impact of denying FP methods is sparse
Although related issues such as a limited
Solo and Festin
method mix resulting from provider bias or method stock outs have
been explored these studies have not given a strong voice to women on
the effects on their lives of limited choice and access Solo and Festin
Bertrand et al
In this paper we aim to give women the
opportunity to describe their experiences with turnaway from FP in
Malawi and explore and analyse the reasons women understood they
were turned away and the potential outcomes and consequences

Malawi was one of few sub Saharan African countries to reach

was achieved through general health system strengthening among other
activities Gunnlaugsson and et al
From to Malawi had a conservative FP policy in place
requiring women to be married undergo a full physical exam meet age
and parity restrictions and have permission from their husbands to
initiate FP Tavrovv Devlin et al Health facilities offered
FP services only once per week Tavrow In the Ministry of
Health and Population MOHP introduced a new FP policy relaxing
many of these restrictions
The policy eliminated re

quirements related to age parity and permission of husband and
allowed FP for limiting births rather than just birth spacing It also set
the expectation that FP services should be offered daily at MOHP
facilities
Today trained community health workers in Malawi are allowed to
initiate women on oral contraceptive pills OCPs and injectable
contraception but facility based services remain an important source of
FP for many women in Malawi Government of Malawi Ministry of
Facility based FP services are usually provided by nurses
Health
midwives clinicians and health surveillance assistants HSAs who
generally start with a group counselling session for prospective clients
which is held in the morning During each session various FP methods
are explained to clients including their possible side effects After the
group counselling session has ended clients speak with providers indi
vidually to decide upon and receive a method as appropriate and
available
Methodology
This qualitative study was part of a larger mixed method study that
gathered data on clients and providers from FP units in health fa
cilities in three districts in Malawi from October to December
Peterson et al Peterson et al In the first part of the
study clients who were turned away from receiving a method of FP at a
facility on the day they sought one participated in a survey on the day of
turnaway Clients who agreed and provided a phone number were fol
lowed up six and weeks post turnaway At the time of the week
follow up visit or the six week follow up for those reporting preg
nancy at six weeks research assistants asked clients via telephone if
they would be willing to participate in a focus group discussion FGD
The two districts with the highest turnaway rates were selected for the
FGDs Data collectors attempted to reach all clients who lived in the two
selected districts and stopped when they had eight participants agreeing
to participate No alternate participants were selected Turned away
clients were eligible for an FGD if they had access to a phone were
willing to be contacted and expressed interest in participating
We chose to use FGDs to allow women to share their experiences in
J M Peterson et al
their own words Qualitative research including FGDs allows for a
greater understanding of complex issues than quantitative methods
alone and offers greater opportunities to bring unanticipated findings to
light
Baum Bryman Krueger and Casey
In our
case a qualitative methodology put the turned away clients in the po
sition of expert witnesses and allowed researchers to see the world
through their eyes Bryman In some cultures participants may
feel shy about sharing personal information in a group setting In
Malawi however local researchers advised that clients would feel more
comfortable sharing personal information in an FGD than in individual
interviews because they would know in a group setting that others were
also sharing such information thus the risk of social desirability bias
would be reduced
Elrofaie
Study design and data collection
The qualitative data presented here are taken from three FGDs with
turned away clients conducted three to six months after turnaway The
number of FGDs was constrained by cost and feasibility The turned
away clients came from two districts in Malawi Kasungu and Zomba
The team intended to include six to eight participants per FGD but in
two cases five participants attended Discussions took place in a private
space at available primary school classrooms in each district in late
March and early April Clients participating in FGDs were
compensated Malawian kwachas or approximately US IO for
their time as required by the Malawian institutional review board the
National Health Sciences Research Committee NHSRC Although
COVID had not yet been detected in Malawi at the time of the FGDs
rates were rising throughout the world To accommodate social
distancing in their transportation to and from the FGDs participants
were offered transportation reimbursement and encouraged to use
transportation that could best ensure social distancing motorcycle taxi
in place of minibus for example Those needing reimbursement for
transportation received US US depending on the distance trav
elled and means of transportation used
The data collection team consisted of a lead interviewer and a note
taker both Malawian women with bachelor s degrees in relevant fields
and previous experience with qualitative data collection in health
related studies Both had participated in the quantitative portion of
the study and were familiar with the research goals and objectives Prior
to initiating the FGDs they received an additional two days of training
on qualitative data collection including modules on key components of
effective facilitation such as not interrupting respondents not making
assumptions about what participants will say and clarifying points that
are unclear
During the FGD the interviewer used a semi structured open ended
discussion guide to lead the participants through predetermined ques
tions and topics The research team developed the discussion guide after
analysis of the turnaway and follow up survey data The aim was to gain
a deeper understanding of those results by allowing the women to ex
press their views on their FP visits The broad topics included experi
ences with and reasons for turnaway perceptions of the quality of the
services they had received including their understanding of why they
had been turned away what clients do as a result of being turned away
and subsequent outcomes after turnaway The FGDs were conducted in
Chichewa
Data management and analysis
FGDs were audio recorded and transcribed directly into English by
the lead interviewer transcriptions were reviewed by the note taker
present at the FGDs Transcriptions included bracketed notes from the
transcriber lead interviewer to add context to comments where neces
sary Further context was provided by Malawian members of the
research team to its non Malawian members
We used grounded theory to analyse the transcripts first by open
Midwifery
coding to find similarities and differences in results then using axial
coding to establish connections between categories and subcategories
and finally selective coding to establish core categories themes and the
grounded theory
While we expected some topics to
Priest et al
overlap with what we had found in the quantitative surveys regarding
reasons for turnaway we chose to use a grounded theory framework to
allow for new categories to emerge and to capture nuances in how cli
ents might describe the reasons for turnaway and other topics explored
We allowed themes to develop across questions rather than simply
quantifying responses to particular questions
The transcripts were imported into NVivo QSR International Pty
Ltd
for analysis We performed inter coder agreement checks
with two coders and discussed any discrepancies until we reached
agreement Demographic information for the FGD participants was
based on follow up surveys conducted six and weeks post turnaway
Specific comments made during FGDs were not linked to the de
mographic details given at the time of the initial survey
Ethics
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by FHI s Pro
tection of Human Subjects Committee in Durham NC USA as well as
the National Health Science Research Committee in Malawi All study
staff completed training on research ethics the protocol and informed
consent administration All participants provided their written informed
consent to participate
Results
Three FGDs were held two in Kasungu District with five partici
pants each and one in Zomba District with six participants for a total of
Participant quotes are presented verbatim with minimal editing for
clarity
Participant background and demographic data
Demographic data for FGD participants were collected during the
exit survey conducted at the facility the day they were turned away and
was available for of the participants The participants were on
average age years range All but one was married and all
had given birth at least once including eight who had given birth within
six months of the day we first spoke to them Nine had a primary school
education and six had a secondary school education One of the par
ticipants reported on the six week survey that her partner disapproved
of her use of FP the others reported their partners had approved FP use
Based on the six week post turnaway survey eight of the FGD partici
pants were able to start a method by that time and three more were able
to start by weeks post turnaway
Reasons for turnaway
After establishing the meaning of the term turnaway with FGD
participants as leaving a health facility without a method of FP on the
day a client wanted one facilitators asked about why clients get turned
away Using thematic analysis as a part of our grounded theory frame
work we classified the reasons for turnaway most discussed into eight
categories Table All were mentioned in two or more FGDs
No proof of not being pregnant
Women discussed being turned away when they could not demon
strate they were not pregnant If a woman had missed a period or came
in between periods health workers asked her to come back after taking a
pregnancy test or while she was menstruating In some cases not
menstruating was mentioned in the context of initiating a new method
but in many cases the participants were referring to clients coming for a
reinjection Participants noted this was particularly unfair for women

Medical reasons
who missed a reinjection date by just a few days given that missing
periods while using injectable contraception is common
If the day you were appointed to come for FP and you did not come
and go the following day they turn you away so that you get a
pregnancy test first so they see evidence that you are eligible to
access FP FGD
If a woman has gone after the appointed date has passed she is told
to come back when she is menstruating It s not right because some
methods make some women not to menstruate For example Depo
injectable most people stop menstruating when they are using this
method and yet the providers want you to menstruate first as proof
that you are not pregnant This is not right FGD
Method and or supply stock outs
Facilities can run out of methods or the supplies needed to initiate a
method such as the trocar needed to insert a contraceptive implant
Known as stock outs this reason for turnaway was frequently
mentioned by FGD participants Specifically noted by the participants
were stock outs of injectables implants intrauterine devices IUDs and
insertion materials In some cases participants said that during a stock

get the method or a future date when the method should be back in
supply Some women also mentioned being advised to use pills or con
doms while waiting for injectables to be available but other women
reported that they had not been offered any backup methods and had
simply been turned away One participant gave an example of the
consequences of stock outs
Sometimes they know that we are going to get our children checked
by the scale at the under five growth monitoring clinic but the
stock is little like for Depo injectable to cater for all of us They
communicate when we should come back but while waiting some
women end up pregnant FGD
Participants found it disappointing to be turned away for method or
supply stock outs but understood this reason for turnaway when all
women seeking that method were turned away
Arriving late
Participants explained that they can get turned away when there are
too many clients for providers to see by a certain time In one example a
participant reported that providers will see clients up until but any
clients still waiting at that time are asked to come back another day In
other cases clients who arrive late to the facility are turned away upon
arrival Like for Health Centre they open at clock so if you are
late beyond clock they send us away one client explained FGD
Another participant tried to access two services on one day making
her late for FP services
The second time I was turned away they said that I came in late
That day I was also weighing my child at the under five growth
monitoring clinic When I explained they said that I should only
come for one thing FGD
Being turned away for these reasons was frustrating for clients who
came long distances and preferred to receive more than one service in a
single trip to a facility but other participants saw it as fair
Provider unavailable
Providers must not only be present but also trained in all methods
Participants described being asked to return on a different day when the
provider trained to supply a particular method was not present on the
day they were seeking it For example if you want the method placed in
the arm the providers know that the person responsible to insert the
method is not around they advise that you come the following day when
the specific provider comes around FGD
Another client shared another example of a difficult to understand
reason for turnaway
Like when you go and you know that you don t react well to Depo
and you want to collect pills they tell you that we have no pills or
the person responsible to supply pills is not there You end up
disappointed because the pills are needed every day FGD
Clients also discussed that providers may get pulled in to work with
other clients such as those in need of immediate care leaving the FP
service area temporarily without a provider Although clients could
understand the need for FP providers to respond to emergency circum
stances they found this disappointing and frustrating
Provider refusal Participants described situations in which providers
refused to give them a method They had trouble understanding why
they should be turned away just because a provider was tired or wanted
to take a lunch break or had other responsibilities to tend to One
participant said The supplies may be available but the providers will
say they are tired and the clients won t get the methods FGD OI OI
More frequently mentioned was refusal when a client showed up for
J M Peterson et al
a reinjection but not on the assigned day One participant explained FP
days at our facility is Tuesday and Thursday If the appointment date
falls on a different day other than Tuesday or Thursday we are turned
back Sometimes we end up falling pregnant as a result of this FGD
In some cases that participants found frustrating providers appeared
to be saving the requested method for particular women such as those
who arrived in cars or who had personal connections to the providers
It also happens at our health facility that others access the same FP
methods you are going for and yet we are turned away Usually they
prefer well to do people those that have come by car go straight in
the provider room and get assisted while the rest of us are sent back
Sometimes they judge us with the way we are looking or are dressed
we are turned away without any assistance FGD
Needing to wait longer after delivery of a child Some FGD participants
had been told they had come to initiate FP too soon after delivery
Sometimes they tell us that the baby is still young so it is impossible to
get a method of FP before the baby reaches six weeks FDG
Participants said they had been told to wait until six weeks after the birth
of a child to initiate a method without mentioning the method they had
been denied or if they had been offered a backup method such as
progesterone only pills or IUDS which can be used immediately after
delivery
Payment requested Despite methods being offered for free at public fa
cilities FGD participants noted several examples of providers asking for
payments from clients Some participants mentioned providers selling
methods for a profit or needing to be connected to a provider to receive
methods that are in short supply One participant said It happens that
sometimes that some providers are selling the family planning
methods so maybe money is hard to find so we fail to access FP FGD
Another said
The providers share amongst themselves We go to the facilities and
they tell us that there is a stock out but the same provider will tell
you that the same method he has at home So I was wondering why
the FP services are found in their homes and not at the health facility
I did not go to their house to get a method FGD
Yet another participant mentioned making payments When asked to
clarify if the payment was for all services or particular services she
explained
It s mostly the method one is looking for to help build another
hospital Like when I went there they said we should pay
kwachas and then the person handling the records suggested that we
pay more the next time we go like add kwachas so that each one
should contribute kwachas approximately USD in total
FGD
Participants expressed frustration in these cases and did not under
stand why they should have to pay for methods that should be available
for free They reported refusing to pay and instead going without FP
until it could be obtained for free
Medical reasons Women also discussed medical reasons for being
turned away including showing up before a scheduled resupply or
reinjection date anaemia high blood pressure and risk of blood clots
One participant said For me when I was getting a removal they denied
me another method because I was told I have anaemia and so I was told
to wait for three months to observe the situation FGD
Participants understood that for medical reasons some methods
were incompatible with some women

What do clients do when turned away
Participants mentioned several approaches they take to cope when
turned away Most frequently mentioned was sleeping apart from their
husbands to abstain from sexual relations This was preferred to eating
sweets still in their wrappers the local saying used to describe having
sex with condoms But women also mentioned the failure to obtain a
contraceptive method leading to quarrels with their husbands who
sometimes felt their wives had deliberately failed to get a method
because they wanted more children
Other coping mechanisms discussed were returning to the facility on
a different day seeking FP through an outreach service and accepting a
second choice method in place of the one they preferred Accepting an
alternate method was usually noted in conjunction with a second or
third turnaway Going to an HSA who is a paid and trained community
health worker a traditional healer or an assistant at a private facility
were also mentioned One participant said there was nothing she could
do because other facilities did not exist in her area Several noted the
stress of the situation One participant said You get stressed when
turned away You go everywhere You ask friends neighbours and HSAs
for help FGD
Participants in all three of the groups discussed the advantages of
going to private facilities when they can afford it because at private
facilities all methods are in stock and available They tried other facil
ities either public or private when they felt they had not been treated
well by a provider or thought they had a better chance of accessing a
preferred method
I didn t take long before I sought a method I knew that my husband
sleeping alone was not a good idea so I tried hard to visit the Dis
trict Hospital to look for my method and so I got it a week later
FGD OI OI
Participants said they did not return to any facility when they were
geographically isolated and or had to pay large amounts for transport to
a facility Sometimes the transportation is tricky You see that you
travelled a long distance only to be turned away So you start
contemplating on not going back for fear of experiencing a similar
predicament FGD
Finally unwanted pregnancies were noted as an unfair consequence
of turnaway Sometimes you go to access FP methods and you are not
assisted it leads to an unexpected pregnancy so this is hurtful FGD
As described by another participant It s not right to be turned
away because if we get turned way there are high chances of us getting
pregnant and we will be giving birth frequently FGD OI OI
Multiple turnaways are common
Participants in the focus groups described being turned away one to
three times in relation to the time we first met them Many went back in
the week following the initial turnaway and were then able to initiate a
method But for others it was more difficult One participant said The
first time I was turned away was in December due to a holiday The
second time they told me there was a stock out of sterilizing materials I
got a method on my third try FGD
Another participant looking for an implant explained After being
turned away from my local health centre I went to another hospital
but I didn t find it again and then I found an outreach service and
that s where got it FGD
One participant spoke of finding implants stocked out twice and
then the materials for inserting implants were unavailable so she finally
agreed to an injectable instead Another participant said after two un
successful attempts at her local public facility she visited a private fa
cility and was able to initiate her chosen method

Perceived quality of services
When asked about providers during the FGDs participants expressed
several concerns about the quality of the services provided For example
participants mentioned that providers do not always take the time to
explain methods and can treat clients poorly when they are in a hurry
Like when they want to inject us with Depo they do not consider that
we are in pain they just bring in many people and inject us in a hurry
then we go back home we start swelling up FGD
Clients said sometimes there are not enough staff and providers get
tired One participant suggested that providers be rotated among facil
ities We need to reshuffle the providers because the ones we have now
are used to us and don t respect us anymore FGD Participants
also reported that providers can be mean and shout at us
Some participants provided positive feedback related to providers
giving them comprehensive information on all methods and helping
them find the right one for their circumstances One participant recog
nised that providers give better information than friends do
The problem that I noticed amongst women is that we listen to our
friends we find out they are complaining about FP services and we
take it from them that there is no help we can get from the providers
We get easily discouraged but if we could take the initiative to hear
from the providers themselves I believe it would help us all FGD
