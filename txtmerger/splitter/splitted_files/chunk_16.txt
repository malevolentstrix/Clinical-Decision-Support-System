portunity of ANC services
among reproductive age women in Eastern Ethiopia
sample size methods of assessment and the time gaps of the
study period Another possible explanation is that the study
population has lower access to information on maternal
healthcare services of which ANC is one of the vital compo
nents In contrast to this the findings from this study are rel
atively higher than those from studies conducted in different
settings such as Jimma Town The possible dif
ference may be due to the fact that East Ethiopia has a higher
level of ANC use which may be due to the fact that the area
was a cash crop area of Ethiopia and could have better
opportunities for information and better access to health
institutions than the other areas In addition seasonal vari
ability when the studies were conducted could explain the
observed difference among the findings
Findings from this study pointed out that the age of
women was a significant predictor of outcome variables
Thus women in the age range of were times
more likely to miss ANC opportunities than women in the
age range of and above This is consistent with the study
conducted in Kenya Malawi and Ghana It is crystal
clear that this cohort of the population is youth and adoles
cents Hence much has to be expected to enhance their con
cerns and complaints related to those of the ANC which in
turn plays a crucial role in reversing their absence from ANC
services Furthermore this is partially explained by the fact
that women in age groups above were more adapted to
and integrated into the services than their counterparts
The results of our research demonstrate that ANC
services were used more frequently as maternal education
levels increased This result is conceivable because increased
education will give women a greater understanding of and
awareness of ANC services Furthermore self independence
confident decision making and capability for managing
household and health all increased with better educational
levels Findings show that respondents who were
unable to read and write in elementary and secondary
education were and more likely to miss
ANC service than those who had college and above The odds
of missing an antenatal care service were reduced when educa
tional status increased This finding was supported by previous
research in Southern Ethiopia Northwest Ethiopia
and Western Ethiopia a systematic review conducted
in Ethiopia and EDS carried out in rural Ethiopia
Kenya Guinea Afghanistan Angola

East African countries India Nepal
and Nigeria Educated women might be empowered to
get services and education makes women have
decision making skills On top of this educated
women have knowledge of danger signs Educated
women might be aware of the advantages of antenatal care ser
vices provided at the service delivery points for the fetus and
themselves Moreover this may be linked to the
fact that more educated women are aware of the advantages
of using ANC which enhances maternal and fetal health
through early detection of issues connected to pregnancy
and the receipt of different preventative and health promotion
services Also educated women can have access to media out
lets that promote the importance of prompt ANC commence
ment and healthcare facilities that offer the treatment
Contrary to these illiterate women could not fully appreciate
the value of ANC services for the health and safety of their
unborn fetus because of the lack of knowledge about the pros
and cons of ANC
The likelihood of utilization of ANC services among
women who had five or more births was less likely to
be missed compared to women who had one birth This
study is supported by studies conducted in Eastern Ethiopia
and elsewhere in Cambodia One explanation for
this could be that first time mothers are more likely than
second or third time mothers to be afraid of getting preg
nant and want to deliver their babies in a hospital A
study showed that women perceive that the first pregnancy
could bring more risks than subsequent pregnancies and
they become less attentive when the number of pregnancies
exceeds a certain limit Furthermore women who had a
history of giving birth safely would feel they were healthy
and not intend to seek delivery services from health facilities
In addition evidence indicates that women who have
many children are less likely to give birth in a healthy insti
tution Therefore community health programs should
consider community awareness creation to improve institu
tional delivery among women with multipara
According to the WHO every expectant mother should go
to at least four antenatal care appointments and give birth
at a health facility with the assistance of a skilled healthcare
provider According to our study women who had three
ANC visits were less likely to miss ANC services than
who had only one ANC visit Our findings were consistent
with the research done in Eastern Hararghe However
it was less than the results of research carried out in the Tigray
Region and Dembecha District in Ethiopia as well as
in Nigeria The probable variations in the supply of high
quality healthcare services and limited access to transportation
could be the likely causes of the differences
This research showed that optimal ANC was better as
compared to the findings of previous studies done in
Nekmet Ethiopia and elsewhere in Kenya
The reason for this variation could be the
emphasis given by the government of Ethiopia to improve
maternal health service utilization considering that it is
one of the exempted services in Ethiopia
Furthermore this study pointed out that pregnant
women who came for ANC follow up in the fourth and

second trimesters were found to be important predictors of
outcome variables Thus pregnant women who came for
ANC follow up during the fourth and second trimesters
were and less likely to miss out on ANC services
as compared to their counterparts respectively Studies car
ried out in many contexts including Gonder Northwest
Ethiopia provide support for this study Addis Ababa
and Malawi The possible justification could be
the fact that pregnant women who came to ANC follow up
during the second and third trimesters may hugely
understand the benefit of ANC as they are subjected to the
thought that they missed plenty of benefits provided to preg
nant women This regression clearly enhances and tightens
the need to be actively involved in the services of the ANC
Furthermore because they joined this vital service late in
the pregnancy journey and after experiencing the vital bene
fits of ANC services they continue to use it
Finally in this study the source of information for ANC
services was found to be significantly associated with out
come variables Hence the study participants who heard
information from TV radio and relatives were and
less likely to use ANC services respectively This is
congruent with the results of EDHS conducted in
Amhara Holeta and Addis Ababa
Although a relative or a partner may be a trusted source of
information there is a chance of the dissemination of biased
information which in turn affects the utilization of antenatal
care Moreover nowadays people are fed up with main
stream media which leads them not to attend the media as
they think that the information disseminated through them
is not reliable
Practical Implications and Future
Research Direction
This investigation made it clear that some of those pregnant
women lost the chance to receive ANC Therefore people
who successfully and efficiently received concentrated ANC
visits profited considerably and immensely from the advice
and assistance of healthcare professionals working in the
setup More significantly it gave the women practical knowl
edge about birth preparation preparing for problems early
treatment and spotting concurrent issues We strongly urge
researchers to employ observational studies to ascertain the
impacts of the missed chance of ANC on the health of mothers
and their babies since we are only worried about the missed
opportunity of ANC rather than its result Furthermore
because the study was conducted at the community level
extrapolating results for those who worked in institutions
would be diffcult which in turn affected the external validity
of the study
Limitation
The limitation of this study is that it does not address the
qualitative aspects like the detailed reasons why mothers
missed their antenatal care follow up Therefore it is open
for researchers to conduct a qualitative study on why women
missed their subsequent antenatal care follow up
Conclusions
This study pointed out that relatively high proportions of
pregnant women experienced missed opportunities in ante
natal care follow up Factors such as those who are women
in the age range of years unable to read and write
elementary and secondary education status those who have
one parity those who have three round visits being in the
first and second trimesters those who heard information
Journal of Pregnancy
from a health care provider and TBA were identified as pre
dictors of ANC utilization Therefore in order to enhance
the uptake of four full visits health policy implementers
need to coordinate their tracking of pregnant women who
missed their antenatal care session

Artificial intelligence gives pregnant women another avenue for receiving
healthcare information With the advancement of information and
communication technology searching online for pregnancy information has
become commonplace during COVID This study aimed to explore
pregnant women s information seeking behavior based on data mining and
text analysis in China Posts on maternal and infant related websites were
collected during June and January A total of valid posts
were obtained Based on the data we performed correlation analysis topic
analysis and sentiment analysis The correlation analysis showed the positive
effects of population population with a college education or above and GDP
on post counts The topic analysis extracted six nineteen eighteen thirteen
eleven sixteen thirteen sixteen nineteen and fourteen topics in different
months of pregnancy reflecting different information needs in various
pregnancy periods The results of sentiment analysis show that a peak of the
posts emerged in the second month of pregnancy and the proportion of
emotionally positive posts reached its peak in the sixth month of pregnancy
The study provides important insights for understanding pregnant women s
information seeking behavior

Introduction
Artificial intelligence creates opportunities for enabling pregnant women to
receive healthcare information Pregnancy is a crucial period in a woman s life
accompanied by physical change psychological change and role transformation
Information seeking can play an important role in addressing the issue of a healthy
delivery Access to advantageous and concerned information contributes to health related
decisions and the life of both pregnant women and unborn children Kamali et al
Childbirth related information is considerable for performing beneficial interventions
and suggestions for pregnant women Kamali et al For example health related
information will enable women to prepare for pregnancy concentrate on balanced
nutrition and medication use during pregnancy and make decisions on exercise
intensity and mode
frontiersin org
Hou and Hou
Extant research on health information has addressed the
crucial role of research contexts such as the user group and
the domain of information subject in determining
information needs Pian et al Reifegerste et al
The development of information technology and the
spread of the mobile Internet enable pregnant women to seek
information in a more conveniently and fairly way Centered
on the information needs of maternal health recent studies
have shown that pregnant women s information seeking
behavior is crucial to enriching the knowledge of
childbirth and maternal health and improving maternal
health outcomes Kamali et al Ahmadian et al
Jin et al Kassim For example Kamali
et al found that pregnant women need information
such as psychological and physical complications after
delivery and pregnancy nutrition in the descriptive study
The qualitative study conducted by Kassim found that
the unavailability of health facilities and limited chances of
accessing professional health care could lead to the results
that pregnant women seek information from non
professional and informal sources Ahmadian et al
identified commonly searched topics during pregnancy using
the questionnaire However researchers have not treated the
topics of information seeking and pregnant women s
emotions in much detail by employing a relatively large
amount of data
The objective of this research is to explore pregnant women s
information seeking behavior during the whole pregnancy
including the factors that contribute to the information
seeking behavior the topics that cause pregnant women s
attention at different months of pregnancy and the change in
pregnant women s emotions at different stages of pregnancy By
collecting and analyzing the posts in the pregnant section
under Mama cn from June to January and
valid posts the current work provides a comprehensive
study
Materials and methods
Data collection
With the advancement of Internet technology pregnant
women s behavior of seeking online health information has
become a universal trend worldwide because of insufficient
information received from healthcare providers and the
natural advantage of the Internet to ask questions
anonymously Dahshan et al As one of the
largest maternal and child health websites in China
Mama cn has integrated websites APPS new media

Mama cn was selected as the research data source for this
study This study collected the posts in the pregnant section
under Mama cn from June to January
involving data from the first month of pregnancy to the
tenth month of pregnancy The current study extracted the
following information from the pregnant section under
Mama cn posts username post time duration of
pregnancy city and text A total of posts were
obtained Examples of our dataset are presented in Table l
We pre processed the original data before formal analysis by
the following procedures First the raw information may include
missing city tags irrelevant advertising messages or posts that
did not match the actual time of pregnancy We filtrated and
deleted the above data and finally obtained texts
Second the original message may contain distracting
information such as interpunction emoticons blank and
hashtags For excluding data noise and improving data
analysis efficiency we employed regular expressions
operations in Python for text filtering
Measures were performed to ensure data privacy
anonymity and security The data collection and analysis
did not disclose any privacy issues regarding pregnant
women s identifiable and sensitive information Favaretto
et al During data collection only username post
time duration of pregnancy city and text were extracted In
data processing and analysis only the duration of pregnancy
city and text data was used while the personal information of
users was not disclosed By involving as many samples as
possible more anonymity was preserved as a combination of
the variables will be repeated among the samples Leon Sanz

The process of topic extraction
Its model structure is more complete and clearer and the

Therefore LDA is widely used in text mining text
clustering language processing and other aspects The topic

Given other hyperparameters the selection process of topic

topic number When the number of topics is too large there
will be many topics without obvious classification semantic
information When the number of topics is too small broad
topics will be generated with a mixture of two or more
distributions
Panichella
Therefore the
determination of the optimal number of topics is an
important issue A coherence score was used to determine
the optimal number of topics with a higher coherence score
indicating better quality of topics et al
Panichella Shah et al This study used the
open source LDA tool in the Gensim library The LDA
model was evaluated by topic coherence to determine the
optimal number of topics According to the trained LDA
model the topic words under each topic were obtained and

Text sentiment analysis based on SnowNLP
In recent years there has been an increasing interest in
sentiment analysis Wang et al Sentiment analysis
also known as opinion mining is an application of text
mining and computational linguistics to mine subjective texts
with emotional colors and identify the emotional tendencies
contained in them It is a process of identifying information
from texts and analyzing processing induction and reasoning
subjective texts with emotional color Through sentiment

are mainly divided into three types sentiment dictionary based
machine learning based and deep learning based Xu et al
Li et al The machine learning based analysis
method trains the emotion classifier with emotion labeled
data to achieve emotion classification Classification accuracy
relies on high quality human annotated training sets and large

the results of human subjective data annotation will also affect
the classification effect The deep learning based analysis is based
on feature self learning and deep neural network It has a good
classification effect when dealing with high dimensional
unlabeled big data but it is difficult to accurately classify the
semantically ambiguous and short text content in social
networks The sentiment dictionary based method is an
unsupervised method which uses a sentiment dictionary to
discriminate the sentiment polarity of text containing
keywords to achieve sentiment classification for each text
There is no need for complex data labeling in the research
process and the accuracy of emotion recognition can be
improved by adjusting and expanding the vocabulary of the
sentiment dictionary according to the specific research
background
SnowNLP a Python library for Chinese natural language
processing is used to analyze the sentiment of texts The tool is
based on a sentiment dictionary to analyze the sentiment
orientation of texts SnowNLP employs a sentiment dictionary
to realize the sentiment tendency analysis of the text The main
functions include part of speech tagging sentiment analysis
