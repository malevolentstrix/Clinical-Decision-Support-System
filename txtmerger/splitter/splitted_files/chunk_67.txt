crease the demand for emergency care Maeng et al document that primary care visits appear to be com
plementary to multiple ED visits while Chen et al find that increased usage of primary care following increases
in Medicaid reimbursement rates does not decrease ED usage suggesting that primary care and ED care may not be
substitutes on the margin In our setting if a portion of prenatal care appointments are used to communicate common
signs of infant distress that require timely care prenatal care may make mothers more likely to recognize when an
appropriate threshold for seeking care has been crossed This information would induce a mother to seek care in either
an outpatient urgent care or emergency setting for her child depending on what is available at the moment the
threshold is breached Our results suggest this is the case and that the information effect dominates the health effect for
both well child and ED care
DATA
Vital statistics data
Although United States federal law requires the collection and publication of Vital Statistics data Federal Vital Statistics
do not contain personal identifiers However some individual states will release personally identifiable information for
specific research purposes In this study we use Natality Data from the State of South Carolina for the time period of
The data are collected from birth certificates and include nearly all births occurring in South Carolina

during the time period under investigation Researchers from the Division of Biostatistics of the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control linked mothers across time and provided de identified data for this
project These data include detailed information on infant health at birth including birth weight gestational age the
presence of birth abnormalities and whether the child was admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit NICU They
also contain basic demographic information pertaining to mother and child maternal education age race child s
gender detailed measures of maternal pre pregnancy and pregnancy risk factors and information on prenatal care
utilization We use these data to construct our main measures of infant health and provide summary statistics in
Table
The Natality data provide information on the number of prenatal care visits the month of pregnancy during which
prenatal care was initiated and the adequacy of prenatal care All of these measures have variously been employed in
different studies throughout the literature We focus on first trimester initiation of prenatal care which is indicative of
prenatal care timing and an early commencement of prenatal care is urged by doctors Additionally as pointed out by
Currie and Rossin Slater the number of prenatal care visits may not be an appropriate measure as the number of
visits are at least partially determined by the length of gestation which is an important determinant of birth weight
itself While our primary specifications compare first trimester initiation of care to an aggregated measure of any other
initiation our first trimester results are robust to separately controlling for second and third trimester initiation relative
to no prenatal care
Because early initiation of prenatal care may not fully capture the amount of prenatal care received by mothers we
employ an alternative measure as a robustness check the adequacy of prenatal care as measured by the Kotelchuck
index This index is constructed by calculating a ratio of observed to expected prenatal care visits adjusted for gesta
tional age classified into four categories inadequate intermediate adequate and adequate plus Kotelchuck We
compress this categorical variable into a binary indicator for whether a mother received at least adequate prenatal care
Finally in online Appendix E we re estimate our models with indicators for first trimester initiation third trimester
initiation and no prenatal care to allow for a finer gradation of the impacts of prenatal care than those of our binary
measures as presented in the main text
For outcomes we employ a continuous measure of birth weight as well as the incidence of low birth weight
g and very low birth weight g Medical and economic research has generally found convincing
evidence of the detrimental effects of low birth weight on infant survival and future health An additional indicator
for infant health is gestational age at birth Infants that are born prematurely less than weeks of gestation have a
much higher incidence of mortality According to Mathews et al health issues related to prematurity were
responsible for of all infant deaths in Additionally premature infants may suffer long term neurological
impairments developmental delays and physical disabilities leading to significant health care costs throughout life
Although gestational age can directly influence the number of visits it cannot influence the onset of prenatal care
Therefore we also estimate the effect of prenatal care on the likelihood of being born prematurely as well as on the
likelihood of being small for gestational age SGA and being admitted into a NICU Finally we estimate the impacts
of prenatal care on the incidence of high birth weight g maternal smoking during pregnancy and maternal
weight gain as these outcomes are likely to reflect the pure informational impacts of prenatal care as measured at
birth
Medicaid claims data
The South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs office provided data from South Carolina Medicaid claims of children
between and These claims are submitted to the state for reimbursement and provide a rich source of in
formation on health care utilization for Medicaid enrollees Specifically each claim provides information on medical
procedures that took place during health care encounters medical diagnoses indicators for whether the claim origi
nated in an ED or IP setting and includes a unique patient identifier Additionally each claim has an associated
encounter identifier which allows us to identify whether multiple claims are associated with the same event while we
use this encounter ID to generate all count variables we continue to refer to the encounters as claims for ease of
exposition We use procedure codes and to identify WCVs and ICD diagnoses to identify
children who have ever received care for several ambulatory care sensitive early childhood conditions ACSCs which
are referenced in online Appendix A We provide sample means for all outcomes of interest in results Tables and

exclude these children and only include claims from infants covered under the Pregnant Women and Infants provision
of Medicaid which provides coverage through the first year of an infant s life for families making less than of the
federal poverty level
We construct all health and health care utilization measures by aggregating observed claims for each child within
the first year of life We choose to focus on the first year of life because we only observe claims for children that are
covered by Medicaid The vast majority over of Medicaid paid births in our sample are observed to have
continuous Medicaid coverage in the year they are born limiting concerns about endogenous movements in and out of
Medicaid eligibility For health care utilization we create count variables for the number of claims each child has in an
IP setting or originating in an ED for all claims as well as all WC Vs
Sample construction
Because our identification strategy relies on mothers with multiple observed births we start with a sample of
singleton multiparous births between and that are observed to have any Medicaid eligibility before
From this we exclude observations with no observed claims during the first year of life births to mothers
aged younger than or older than and observations because of missing data Because this process leaves
some observations without sibling pairs we eliminate a further observations leaving us with a final unit of
analysis of multiparous children Of these births are from distinct mothers that change their
prenatal care utilization across pregnancies While our estimated impacts of prenatal care are only identified by those
mothers who change their utilization of prenatal care across pregnancies we provide summary statistics for all
observed births with Medicaid eligibility and no missing data for comparison We choose to exclude children
with observed claims because any child moving out of state or obtaining access to an alternate source of care or
insurance would not show up in our claims data Given that this group represents only about of our sample we
believe it is likely that the majority of these infants are obtaining care outside of the South Carolina Medicaid system
rather than truly forgoing all care including well child care Finally it should be noted that the children included
in our analysis represent approximately of the total births observed in South Carolina between and

ESTIMATION STRATEGY
CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
We assume outcomes for child i born to mother j at time period t in county c and in month m can be represented by
yt Ac V m Cijtcm
ijtcm
Yijtcm is a child outcome such as birth weight in grams or number of WCVs PCijtcm represents a measure of prenatal
care Xijtcm is a vector of observed maternal and child characteristics including mother s age race education reported
household income pre pregnancy BMI length of gestation in weeks indicator variables for whether a mother was
smoking before pregnancy pre pregancy diabetes and hypertension previous poor birth outcomes or preterm birth
previous c section child gender first born status indicators for ages of older siblings at the time of birth and prenatal
WIC participation We also include separate indicators yt Ac and l m for year month and county of birth respectively
Finally gj represents unobserved time invariant characteristics of the mother such as health attitudes or endowments
while Eijtcm represents unobserved time variant factors that influence health outcomes
As previously discussed one difficulty associated with obtaining causal estimates of prenatal care s impacts on
future outcomes is that unobserved maternal characteristics may simultaneously influence these outcomes and how a
pregnant mother utilizes prenatal care If this is the case unobserved maternal characteristics gj will be correlated
with the measure of prenatal care PC For instance health conscious mothers may initiate early and frequent
ijtcm
doctors visits and be more likely to give birth to healthy babies independently of prenatal care This will result in
positive selection and OLS estimates of Equation will overstate the benefits of prenatal care On the other hand
unhealthy mothers may compensate for their own poor health by utilizing more prenatal care In this case the OLS
estimated impact of prenatal care on birth outcomes will be biased downward
To circumvent bias stemming from the inability to control explicitly for maternal health endowments or attitudes
we employ mother specific fixed effects The availability of panel data allows us to compare birth outcomes to the same
mother and control explicitly for gj meaning the key identifying assumption is that the decision to utilize prenatal care
is only uncorrelated with time variant unobserved maternal characteristics Cijtcm We will obtain consistent estimates as
long as there are not unobserved time variant factors that influence both outcomes and prenatal care utilization and by
explicitly controlling for gj our estimated impacts of prenatal care are obtained from differences in outcomes for
mothers who change their prenatal care behavior across pregnancies
We attempt to mitigate any concerns about our identification strategy in a number of ways To control for the
possibility of feedback across pregnancies our preferred specifications include a rich set of controls related to outcomes
of prior pregnancies and add a full set of year month and county of birth fixed effects to control for geographic or
temporal factors that may influence access to care We mitigate concerns that changes in family income insurance
status or access to care could potentially drive changes in prenatal care utilization and future outcomes by limiting our
analyses to only those infants who are eligible for Medicaid within their first year of life and all reported results are
robust to controlling for the observed payer at delivery and further control for reported family income to address
concerns that changes to the Medicaid income eligibility threshold for infants during our study period are driving our
results Finally we present all fixed effects estimates with both the complete exclusion of controls and with a limited
subset of demographic controls to illustrate the stability of the estimates and the degree to which prenatal care is
correlated with observed time variant factors Our estimates are quite stable to the inclusion of these controls sug
gesting that prenatal care is not highly correlated with observed factors that also influence outcomes and diminishing
the concern that it is likely correlated with unobserved factors
We test for reverse causality using observed pre pregnancy maternal health factors as outcomes as correlations
may indicate other unobserved components of maternal health that are related to both the decision to seek pre
natal care and to future health outcomes Even with these robustness checks our identification strategy may still
be biased if there are unobserved factors that are specific to a given pregnancy such as low maternal weight gain
or vaginal bleeding during the first trimester that influence the decision to seek care and outcomes for that
pregnancy Although we cannot directly rule this possibility out factors such as these seem most likely to reveal
the potential for poor health status and would therefore bias our results downwards causing us to underestimate
any benefits of prenatal care Concerns that the decision to seek prenatal care is directly related to variations in
household income or insurance status are mitigated by the fact that all of our estimated impacts on future uti
lization are obtained within the sample of Medicaid eligible children While there may be some concern due to the
CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
BERSAK AND SONCHAK ARDAN
fact that our data span both the Great Recession and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act these events
would only pose identification problems if they changed the composition of Medicaid eligible births or directly
influence prenatal care utilization and future outcomes However South Carolina was one of the states which did
not expand Medicaid following the passage of the Affordable Care Act and we only observe slight no more than
from baseline increases in the number of Medicaid eligible births during the Great Recession Additionally we
observe between and of mothers with first trimester initiation of prenatal care for each of the years in
our data suggesting that if any changes in utilization patterns are driven by the Great Recession they are small in
nature
A final concern is that the subgroup of mothers who change their prenatal care utilization across pregnancies are
fundamentally different from mothers with consistent prenatal care In Table we present summary statistics for three
distinct groups of mothers all mothers in column multiparous mothers in column and mothers with differences in
first trimester initiation of care across different births in column Although the subgroup of mothers in column look
somewhat similar to the full sample of multiparous mothers along many dimensions most differences between the
groups are statistically significant due to the large sample sizes It is important to remember that inclusion in this group
is conditional upon having at least one pregnancy in both groups of prenatal care and it is therefore logical and to be
expected that the averages for the prenatal care variables as well as all potential outcome variables would be signifi
cantly different from the full sample averages
Equation assumes the impacts of prenatal care are constant and symmetric across the birth order and irre
spective of the direction of change meaning we will not identify any impacts of prenatal care that arise through
mechanisms which durably impact future outcomes For instance if an educational component of prenatal care
provides durable human capital then any mothers with adequate prenatal care in an early pregnancy would continue
to see impacts in future pregnancies regardless of future prenatal care utilization Broadly speaking we find no
consistent differential impacts of prenatal care for first born children when we relax these assumptions and we report
results from this set of estimates and provide a brief discussion of the theoretical implications in online Appendix C
Our approach also implicitly assumes that prenatal care from an early pregnancy does not influence observed
maternal pre pregnancy risk factors such as smoking status or BMI before becoming pregnant To the extent that
these assumptions are invalid they will bias us against finding any impacts of prenatal care and our estimates that
control for observed pre pregnancy risk factors can be interpreted as the impacts of prenatal care net of any impacts
arising through these channels
In spite of these robustness checks our results still rest on the key assumption of this identification strategy that
changes in prenatal care utilization across pregnancies are not related to unobserved changes in maternal charac
teristics There are a number of exogenous factors that could cause changes to prenatal care utilization stemming from
the supply side of the health care delivery system Low income Medicaid women may have difficulties finding a
physician willing to accept them scheduling health care appointments or having to wait for long periods in clinics
Beckmann et al Sunil et al Some studies identified changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates to
physicians for treating Medicaid patients as a determinant of the amount of prenatal care received by women
Gray Sonchak Other studies have exploited factors that influence access to care such as a lack of
transportation transportation disruptions or distance to clinics Evans and Lien estimate that a transportation
strike in Pennsylvania contributed to missed prenatal care visits while in related work Rossin Slater finds
geographic access to a clinic impacts a mother s likelihood of participation in the Women Infants and Children WIC
program
Unfortunately because our data only come from South Carolina and do not include particularly fine measures of
patient or provider location we are not able to empirically identify specific external factors that cause changes in
prenatal care over time in our setting However as mentioned above we control for a rich set of time variant personal
maternal characteristics as well as provide a battery of robustness checks that adds credence to our findings Addi
tionally this identification strategy has been recently used by Yan to estimate the impacts of prenatal care on
outcomes at birth and by Bersak and Sonchak and Chorniy et al to provide plausibly causal estimates of
the impact of receiving WIC on childhood health and health care outcomes To the extent that the reasons behind
changes in prenatal care are exogenous to changes in factors we are unable to control for these results will provide
causal estimates on the effect of prenatal care on infant health and health care utilization Additionally it should be
noted our that findings that primary care visits and ED visits are used in a complementary fashion in the production of
infant health do not rely on the validity of this identification strategy

RESULTS
Validity of fixed effects strategy
Table contains our estimated impacts of prenatal care on pre pregnancy smoking body mass index BMI hyper
tension diabetes and for second or later births prior poor pregnancy outcomes Because each of these outcomes
occur prior to pregnancy they cannot be influenced by prenatal care and therefore observed correlations are indicative
of self selection into prenatal care The OLS estimates contained in column suggest there is on net some negative
selection into prenatal care as early initiation of care is associated with a higher probability of pre pregnancy smoking
obesity hypertension and prior poor pregnancy outcomes Within mothers however we find more limited evidence of
selection into prenatal care across pregnancies with the exception of prior poor birth outcomes In column we report
fixed effects estimates that exclude all other controls and estimate that only pre pregnancy hypertension and prior poor
birth outcomes are associated with early initiation of prenatal care In column with the inclusion of demographic
controls we see a small and marginally significant relationship between prenatal care initiation and pre pregnancy
tobacco usage and a positive and statistically significant relationship between prenatal care and prior poor out
comes Finally in column we estimate that receiving adequate prenatal care is associated with a statistically sig
nificant percentage point decrease in the probability of maternal smoking prior to pregnancy While this result is
statistically different from it represents a decrease of less than from the baseline probability of smoking before
pregnancy and is therefore a relatively small change Taken on the whole the estimates in Table suggest that after the
inclusion of maternal fixed effects prenatal care is at worst weakly related to observed maternal risk factors while the

OLS results are indicative of negative selection bias with some mothers compensating for other risky behaviors by
initiating prenatal care earlier There is some stronger evidence that some prenatal care may be related to prior
pregnancy outcomes where some mothers may self sort into early initiation of prenatal care which is more concerning
for our identification strategy However the low baseline frequency of prior poor outcomes means that a relatively small
number of mothers are in this group and are therefore unlikely to drive our other results As a robustness check to
ensure that selection following prior poor outcomes does not drive our results in online Appendix D we exclude all
births occurring to mothers with prior poor outcomes and obtain qualitatively similar results
Impacts of prenatal care on outcomes at birth
Table shows the impacts of prenatal care on outcomes measured at birth We present OLS results in column for
comparison fixed effects estimates with the complete exclusion of controls in column and fixed effects estimates with
the inclusion of only demographic controls in column The point estimated impacts of prenatal care are remarkably
stable across all fixed effects specifications although they are somewhat more precise with the inclusion of controls
Using our preferred specifications in column which contain fixed effects and all controls first trimester initiation of
prenatal care is associated with an increased birth weight of g as well as a decrease in the probability of being born
below the low birth weight and very low birth weight thresholds of and g by and percentage points
respectively Because these are relatively rare outcomes this represents a decrease in the incidence of infants
born at low birth weight and a decrease in the incidence of infants born at very low birth weight
First trimester initiation of prenatal care is also associated with between a and percentage point reduction
in the probability of being SGA or being admitted to the NICU at birth which represent between a and
reduction in the baseline incidence Although all point estimates obtained from fixed effects specifications are smaller
than those obtained via OLS they are all statistically significant at a confidence level While we estimate that early
initiation of prenatal care is associated with a reduction in the probability of preterm birth in columns and when we
include controls the relationship is small and statistically insignificant In column we report estimates using the
Kotelchuck index as an alternative measure for prenatal care for the most part these results are similar to those ob
tained when using first trimester initiation with the notable exception that adequate prenatal care is associated with a
statistically significant increase in the probability of pre term births However this difference is not particularly sur
prising given that the number of observed visits relative to gestational age is a component of the index itself meaning
that a mother with a set number of visits will be classified as having received adequate care if her infant is born at a
younger gestational age
The final three outcomes in Table indicate the extent to which prenatal care changes maternal behaviors during
pregnancy and influences outcomes through informational rather than purely clinical mechanisms Across all fixed
effects specifications we estimate that first trimester initiation of care is associated with a statistically significant in
crease in the probability of an infant being born at high birth weight and of maternal weight gain during pregnancy
Excessively high birth weight is viewed as an adverse outcome meaning that the association between prenatal care and
high birth weight is almost definitely reflecting maternal behavioral changes during pregnancy rather than clinical
interventions We also generally estimate that prenatal care is associated with a decrease in the probability of maternal
smoking during pregnancy though this result is not statistically significant when controls other than maternal fixed
effects are excluded in column and the point estimated impact in our preferred specifications in column of
percentage points represents only a decrease from baseline
Impacts of prenatal care on early childhood health care utilization
Table presents estimated impacts of prenatal care on early childhood health care utilization for three distinct types of
care care received in an IP setting an ED setting and WCVs We estimate prenatal care is associated with a statistically
significant increase in both WCVs and ED utilization along with a small but statistically significant decrease in the
number of IP stays and all sets of results are qualitatively robust to the exclusion or inclusion of additional controls
though the estimates are somewhat attenuated after controlling for demographics and year county and month fixed
effects Additionally they are quite stable to the inclusion of maternal risk factors suggesting that feedback across
pregnancies is not a large concern The estimated impact of first trimester initiation of care on both ED and WC Vs is

On the whole the results presented in Table provide strong support for the theoretical prediction that prenatal
care influences maternal information outlined in Equation and provide evidence that the information effect in
creases the demand for certain types of future health care Our estimated impacts of health measured at birth as well as
the dissipation of any significant impacts on IP care after we control for birth weight suggest prenatal care likely
improves child health Given that IP care is usually not directly demanded by patients and is instead accessed through
either a primary care gatekeeper or referral from an ED finding that prenatal care does not influence IP care through an
information effect seems plausible However if prenatal care is associated with better health status as suggested by our
birth outcome and IP results these results imply that the information effect of prenatal care must increase the demand
for both well visits and ED care and that these impacts are larger than any reduction in demand caused by better health
Our estimates around WCVs can be interpreted in a similar way although it seems plausible that the health effect
would be negligible for well child care
Differential impacts of prenatal care by race

black mothers separately We report estimates corresponding to column in Tables and in columns and while
our results in columns and include controls for birthweight and correspond to column in Table We generally

estimated impacts being larger for infant birthweight and the probability of being LBW or SGA Because infants born to
black mothers tend to have worse outcomes on average the point estimated impacts of prenatal care on the probability

of VLBW and NICU admission are smaller in relative terms for black mothers even though they are larger in absolute
terms These results are similar to those found by Currie and Grogger and Sonchak who both estimated
that prenatal care visits had positive benefits on birthweight for white mothers but not for black mothers
This relationship however flips when we look at outcomes that are more likely to be influenced through the in
formation mechanism We estimate that prenatal care is associated with larger relative changes in the probability of
smoking during pregnancy having a high birth weight infant and maternal weight gain for black mothers Addi
tionally we estimate that early initiation of prenatal care only increases utilization of emergency care for infants of
black mothers and that it increases WCVs by nearly more for black mothers than it does for white mothers We
also estimate that prenatal care is only associated with decreased utilization of IP care for white mothers though this
effect is only marginally significant and dissipates after controlling for birth weight suggesting that these impacts may
largely be due to the improvements in infant health that are observed for children of white mothers
On the whole the results in Table provide interesting insights that deserve further investigation in future work
While they suggest that the direct health effects of prenatal care exist for both black and white mothers they do appear
to be larger for white mothers However the informational mechanism particularly as relates to future health care
utilization appears to be much larger for black mothers These results are quite consistent with the proposals suggested
by Gadson et al to reduce racial disparities in maternal outcomes during pregnancy and outline the many ways
in which non hispanic black mothers experience worse outcomes than other racial groups Many of these innovations
such as the CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care model which was rolled out in South Carolina during our study
period do not substantively change the clinical aspects of prenatal care but do offer a wider range of opportunity for
provider interactions and the provision of information and our results here support the hypothesis that these mech
anisms may be particularly important for black mothers
CONCLUSION
We estimate that prenatal care is associated with improved infant health as measured by observable outcomes at birth
Across the board our results for birth outcomes are consistent with the range of positive estimates reported in the
literature detailed by Corman et al If IP health care utilization is a reasonable proxy for latent health status our
results do suggest that prenatal care broadly improves child health during the first year of life though our results also
suggest that at least some of this impact is driven by better health at birth Finally our results on the utilization of well
child care are entirely consistent with Reichman et al lending them additional credibility
Our results also suggest prenatal care is associated with increases in the future utilization of health care in most
settings including ED care According to figures presented in Lu and Kuo the national average cost
associated with a pediatric IP stay for an ACSC in was with a median cost of According to
figures presented in McWilliams et al the average cost associated with a pediatric ED visit in in
Charlotte NC for a condition related to an ACSC was in dollars Under the assumption that our
estimated changes in utilization are associated with conditions that cost an average amount to treat in each of
these settings using the point estimates in Table suggests that first trimester initiation of care is associated with a
net reduction of in spending per child in emergency and IP settings within the first year of life and that
adequate prenatal care was associated with a net reduction of in spending per child in emergency and IP
settings within the first year of life While these cost savings are modest and are likely offset to some additional
extent by an increase in costs associated with additional utilization of primary care they do suggest that the cost
savings from reducing future hospitalizations are at least large enough to balance out any increased costs from
additional ED care caused by increasing access to prenatal care
As with all studies there are some important caveats and limitations to note regarding the external validity of
our findings First it is important to reiterate that only mothers with multiple Medicaid eligible births are included
in our sample meaning that our results may not generalize to mothers with only one child or those who are not
eligible for Medicaid During the time period we look at however Medicaid does pay for a majority of births in
South Carolina so the results are of interest even if they do not generalize beyond this group Our sample also
only contains births occurring in South Carolina and the results may not necessarily generalize to other states
When comparing births in our data set from with National Birth Certificates data for it is clear that the
Medicaid eligible mothers in South Carolina are more disadvantaged than the average mother with a Medicaid paid
birth In fact mothers in our sample are younger less educated and are more likely to have poor birth outcomes

and various pregnancy risk factors than their whole country peer group Finally there may be concerns that
tertiary factors such as low Medicaid reimbursement rates are acting as barriers to care and driving our results
While it certainly seems plausible that access to care may be a determinant of both prenatal care and WCVs
adequate access to care is not typically associated with increasing ED usage and so seems unlikely to drive our
results If a different unobserved factor such as infant wantedness were driving our primary results it would still
not jeopardize our conclusion that mothers of infants tend to utilize well child care and emergency care in a
complementary fashion
Although it is beyond the scope of what we are able to accomplish with this study one particularly fruitful area
for future research will be to look at the path dependency of health care utilization The totality of our results
appear most consistent with the explanation that prenatal care increases health care utilization perhaps through
educating mothers about potential warning signs that could require urgent attention and therefore helps mitigate
the severity of some early childhood ailments The model and results we present here suggest the demand for
health care at a point in time is a function of prior health care consumed and more work is needed in this area to
be able to make fully informed judgments as to the complete long run impacts and cost effectiveness of prenatal
care as well as whether prenatal care is the most efficient means through which to provide maternal information
Our results agree with the conclusion reached by Yan that expanding access to prenatal care would help
improve infant health at birth relative to the status quo However our hypothesized mechanisms also suggest that
expanding other community based programs providing educational resources and support to mothers could
represent exciting opportunities for additional low cost interventions that may prove equally successful at
improving infant health through informational mechanisms

In other words beliefs about the entire distribution of shocks in both the presence and absence of care
Procedure codes and are technically used for children age to age but we observe a small number of likely coding errors in
our sample from claims using these codes
The reported point estimated impacts of prenatal care which follow are virtually identical to those obtained if we restrict the sample to
only those mothers who change prenatal care utilization across pregnancies
Except for the outcomes of preterm birth and probability of being small for gestational age
We do not aggregate previous poor birth outcomes Rather the data element provided by the state of South Carolina is coded as Previous
poor birth outcomes It is our understanding that this measure along with our other prior birth outcomes are reported as true if a
mother experienced a poor birth outcome in any previous birth
For all reported estimates errors are clustered at the level of the mother to allow for the influence of unobservables to be correlated across
births for each mother However all statistical inference is robust to clustering the errors at the county level to allow for unobservables to
be correlated geographically
If for example changes in prenatal care across pregnancies are caused by unobserved changes in access to the health care system it
would then mean that mothers with greater access to the health care system utilize both more primary and emergency department care
Although not reported here we also estimate that early initiation of prenatal care is associated with increases of roughly additional
sick visits those which do not originate in an ED nor are inpatient or the conditions included in within the first year of life suggesting
that it is not solely access to care which is driving any observed increased utilization of emergency care
Though not reported here the results presented in this and all subsequent subsections are also robust to the inclusion of controls for
insurance payer at birth
Though not reported we find small less than impacts of prenatal care on the extensive margin of any inpatient claims any care in an
ED or any WCVs and these impacts are only statistically significant for ED visits or WCVs
Less than of our final sample do not identify as white or black in our data and so are excluded from this analysis
