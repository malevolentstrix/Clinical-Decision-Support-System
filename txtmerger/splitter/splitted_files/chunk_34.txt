 same conditions
decreased This change could be attributed to the
improved assessment at the time of admission
Moreover we have observed the same trend in iden
tification and referral of postpartum hemorrhage that
could be explained by increased administration of
oxytocin within min of delivery
Strengths and limitations
The results of our study contributes to the dearth of lit
erature on the role of CDSS in maternity care From the
onset of the program our team trained and worked
closely with the focal point in each facility to ensure
quality of data and timely reporting Furthermore as a
part of program implementation all providers were
trained in distinguishing and reporting fresh still births
Additionally data reported from facilities were regularly
validated by our team The availability of data before
and during the program implementation allowed us to
estimate the role of CDSS in improving quality of intra
partum care and delivery outcomes Our study has few
limitations Firstly it is possible that providers carried
out the patient management according to the standards
but didn t record it in application Secondly our assess
ment involved direct observation of provider practices
as a result potential Hawthorne effect would have hap
pened To minimize Hawthorne effect we trained our
project officers using standard observation checklist and
standard operating procedures Lastly due to utilization
of program data in our analysis establishing causal claim
is limited

Conclusion
To our knowledge this is the first study that provides
and evidence on the role of technology to improve the
quality of intrapartum care and delivery outcomes in
India However the results of this study could be gener
alized to another country with similar settings Our
study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality
of intrapartum care and delivery outcome Future studies
with rigorous study design are required to understand
the impact of technology in improving quality of mater
nity care These studies could provide evidence on redu
cing the burden of maternal and neonatal death
attributable to inadequate quality of care in India and
globally

University of Kuopio Department of Nursing Science P O Box Kuopio Finland
Open Access
Abstract The objective of the present paper is to review how pregnant women over years have been described in
previous research and to review the risks associated with pregnancy in those of advanced maternal age Computerized
searches of the Cinahl PubMed Medic and Cochrane Library databases were undertaken Research articles in scientific
journals relevant to the objective and published in English between and were included Data were extracted
based on the aims sample authors year and results
Results Advanced maternal age is associated with certain pregnancy related risks Being at risk causes anxiety and
concern which older pregnant women try to ease by being as well informed as possible This may be overwhelming to
some women due to the large amount of information available
Conclusions It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the different feelings and experiences of older
pregnant women in order to meet their individual needs within the maternity services
Keywords Maternal age risk advanced maternal age
INTRODUCTION
In developed countries such as Finland and Sweden
childbearing later in life is a phenomenon which has become
increasingly evident in the last three decades For
example in Finland in of primigravida women
were over years old By this had increased to
The situation is closely comparable with Sweden where
in of primigravidas were years of age or older
In of all women giving birth in Finland
were over years old whereas the figure in was
The risks related to pregnancy in those over years old
especially primiparity can be understood from two
perspectives first the actual medical risks and second the
acceptability of the risks as defined through social discourse
among different groups within society Medical risks are
related to an ageing reproductive system and an ageing body
whereas social discourse prescribes the way in which older
pregnant women are regarded as mothers and when it is
considered that women should have children It has
been said that pregnant women and healthcare providers
understand the risks differently pregnant women evaluate
the risks subjectively through their own experiences
whereas healthcare providers assess the risks in an
apparently more objective way
Advanced maternal age AMA is seen by patients and
healthcare professionals to be correlated with poorer
outcomes to pregnancies This is largely because of the
higher incidence of chronic medical conditions among older
women Women of AMA are often treated as if they are in
need of the level of care necessary for any high risk

pregnancy and they are treated differently even if there is no
scientific basis for different treatment and there are no
medical problems evident However pre existing and
pregnancy related morbidity combined with high maternal
expectations does put these women in greater need of
intervention during pregnancy and birth Despite the
perceptions of increased risks related to AMA it has been
suggested that the risks are manageable and positive
outcomes can be expected
In recent years several reviews concerning pregnant
women aged years or older have been conducted which
have focused on the risks associated with AMA the
relationship between AMA and pregnancy outcomes
the evidence of risks faced by women of AMA and the
association between maternal age and still birth Fewer
studies have focused on women s own experiences of later
childbearing and age related pregnancy risks The purpose of
the present review article is to provide an overview of how
previous research has described pregnant women aged over
and what the pregnancy risks related to AMA are
DATA AND METHODS
Research articles for this review were retrieved from
searches of the Cinahl PubMed Medic and Cochrane
Library databases Keywords used in the search were
Maternal age and over and advanced maternal age
The assistance of an information specialist librarian was used
to confirm the adequacy of keywords used in the search
terms The search was limited to the period between
and in order to focus on the most recent information
available We searched for original research articles
reporting studies conducted using qualitative or quantitative
methods and which had been published in English Other
review articles were omitted from the present review
Studies focusing on both primi and multiparous women
were included
Bentham Open
The Open Nursing Journal Volume
Searching Cinahl with the keywords maternal age
and over returned references searching PubMed with
maternal age over returned and with advanced
maternal age references Searching the Medic and
Cochrane Library databases provided no relevant references
Following retrieval the first phase of the review process
involved reading through the titles of all references in
order to delete references from the selection based on the
exclusion criteria listed below In the second phase abstracts
of all the remaining non excluded references were read
through
The exclusion criteria were the topic was irrelevant to
the objective of this study there was no abstract available
the study was focused on only a particular medical
problem related to pregnancy in older women for example
genetic
screening amniocentesis trisomies
foetal
abnormalities
different medical
conditions
or
developmental disorder with the foetus the study referred
to postpartum and maternity issues and the full research
article was unobtainable with reasonable effort
In the third phase when the final selection of articles had
been made all available full text versions of the selected
articles were read through A further manual search of cited
references in the selected research articles was also made
using the same exclusion criteria mentioned above This
provided two more articles for inclusion in the present
review PubMed produced five and Cinahl eight relevant
research articles so that finally a further articles were
included in the analysis Table
Qualitative studies were examined using content analysis
This inductive analysis revealed certain themes and subjects
within the selected articles which addressed the research
questions and which could finally be grouped together
thematically Quantitative studies which were mainly
focused on the medical risks associated with AMA and
which had been analysed statistically were analysed in the
present review by collating common subject areas and
grouping them together thematically with the articles from
the papers describing qualitative studies
RESULTS
Women s Knowledge of Pregnancy related Risks and
their Decisions concerning the Timing of Childbearing
The knowledgability of older pregnant women
concerning pregnancy related issues has not been the focus
of many studies we found only three research articles that
described women s knowledge of pregnancy risks related to
delayed childbearing and their knowledge base for making
decisions about the timing of motherhood These
studies revealed that women were well aware of the age
related decline in fertility but they relied on the
expectation of the assistance of reproductive technology
being available if needed Some researchers found
that women recognized there to be a higher likelihood of an
older mother giving birth to a baby with Down s syndrome
and of there being a greater risk of miscarriage and
having high blood pressure However the probabilities
of needing to deliver by Caesarean section having a
premature or low birth weight baby stillbirth or of
Lampinen et al
multiple births were not as well identified It has
been suggested that neither women nor men fully recognize
the link between increased maternal age and the
developmental and health related risks of low birth weight or
pre term infants Moreover both men and women lack
knowledge concerning conception pregnancy complications
and infant outcomes as related to delayed childbearing
In general both men and women should be much better
informed about the complications and declining fertility
associated with a first pregnancy at an AMA
Few studies discussed the timing of childbearing
Maheswhari et al found that sub fertile women
thought and years more acceptable as an age at which
to become a first time mother than pregnant women did
Another study revealed that while most women were
satisfied with their decisions of postponing childbearing
women of years of age and older would in retrospect
have started having children earlier in life A stable
relationship education and developing a career before
having a family influenced women s decisions concerning
the timing of childbearing Financial security and their
partner s suitability to be a parent were also important
factors In addition women described having a
feeling of a biological clock ticking away which affected
their decisions concerning the timing of motherhood
Information Gathering and Women s Preparation for
Pregnancy
Issues related to a woman s preparation for pregnancy
were described in five studies These
indicated that being well prepared for pregnancy seemed to
be a characteristic more typical of older pregnant women
Being considered at risk causes women anxiety which
they try to ease by preparing themselves for pregnancy and
seeking information Carolan showed that women
aged over years approached pregnancy as a project which
should be preceded by a stage of careful planning These
women described their main health concerns as the
likelihood of foetal genetic problems or maternal
complications during pregnancy e g gestational diabetes
postpartum depression multiple births or miscarriage
Prior to conception older women also prepared
themselves for pregnancy both mentally and physically
Such preparation often meant losing weight going on diets
and taking exercise Some women visited specialist
doctors to discuss existing health issues such as blood
pressure Choosing hospitals and birth care options was
another way in which women prepared for pregnancy and
being aware of the increased risks associated with their age
they especially valued the availability of emergency services
at hospitals Having become pregnant women adopted a
different range of health promoting activities in response to
their concerns and needs in relation to their pregnancy
These activities included following a healthy lifestyle and
taking special care of their nutritional status
Women also approached pregnancy by searching for
information from multiple sources which they sometimes
found offered contradictory advice Women
searched for information from the internet journal articles
childbirth educators and hospital telephone information

Results
Levels of amniocentesis ceasarean section assisted
delivery induction and augmentation were all higher
among older women Maternity service use also
increases significantly with age
Independence a stable relationship and declining
fertility influenced women s decisions about timing of
motherhood
Four risk related themes realizing the status at risk
hoping for reassurance dealing with uncertainty and
getting through it negotiating risk
Percentage of mothers approached childbearing as a
major project in their lives Project progressed through
clearly defined stages of information gathering
planning and preparing and finishing up tasks prior to
the birth
Mothers were found to have access to large volumes of
health information Midwives and maternal and child
health nurses revealed a tendency to provide older first
time mothers with considerable health information of a
medical orientation understanding that this is what the
women required
Increasing age was significantly associated with
miscarriage chromosomal abnormalities congenital
anomalies gestational diabetes placenta previa and c
section
Perinatal death intrauterine fetal death and neonatal
death increased with age Also intercurrent illnesses
and pregnancy complications increase with increasing
age
Pregnant women aged or older are at increased risk
of complications in pregnancy compared with younger
women
Older women were more likely to have hypertension
diabetes mellitus placental abruption or placenta
revia but they were less likely to be nulliparous and to
smoke Also preterm birth and small for gestational age
rates were higher
Despite awareness of the impact
of age on fertility of the subfertile group expected

networks Carolan b found that career
oriented educated women preferred information written for
a medical and midwifery audience rather than popular
reading material such as magazine articles Carolan
also found that pregnant women over years old
sometimes felt they had too much information concerning
age related pregnancy risk and foetal disorders which made
them anxious and made it difficult for them to focus on
positive outcomes However these women still wanted to be
as fully informed as possible
In one study Carolan found that healthcare
providers gave a lot of medically oriented information to
pregnant women aged over presuming that this was what
these older educated women needed and wanted However the
recipients found such information to be more overwhelming
than empowering and midwives and maternal and child health
nurses found it quite challenging to provide the right level and
type of advice to these women However although these
women felt themselves to be over informed which increased
their concerns they still thought that information about the
risks and benefits of delayed childbearing should be provided
and that the ideal time would have been at an age when they
were in their early
Manifestation of Risks and Women s Experiences of
Risks Pregnancy and Care
It has been shown that AMA increases pregnancy related
risks and the probability of obstetric complications Six
studies described the risks complications and obstetric
outcomes related to pregnancy in women aged over years
Compared to younger women the types of complications
that women over years are at increased risk of during
pregnancy include gestational diabetes placenta praevia
pre eclampsia miscarriage and pregnancy
induced hypertension as well as Caesarean sections
Induction of labour augmentation with
primiparae and assisted deliveries are also associated with
women of AMA Perinatal mortality perinatal and
neonatal death and intra uterine foetal death also increase
with increasing age Older women are also more likely
to have been diagnosed with conditions such as hypertensive
disorders diabetes mellitus and other chronic diseases for
which they are already taking medication These
chronic medical conditions may further complicate their
pregnancies
However some risks should be interpreted with caution
Bell et al found that age related increased
intervention rates were
independent of maternal
complications during pregnancy complications during
labour a history of infertility and other confounding factors
Age alone was not responsible for gestational hypertensive
disorders although chronic hypertension was found to be
more common among women of advanced maternal age
Adverse outcome rates were in fact higher among older
women even when there were no complications in their
pregnancies Interestingly the increased occurrence of
pre existing diagnoses or complications among older women
was not related to the increased risk of an adverse perinatal
outcome Despite the fact that increased risk with
increasing age has been clearly demonstrated studies
suggest that overall pregnancy outcomes are favourable
because perinatal death is such a rare event even with AMA
mothers
Being at risk is not always obvious to pregnant AMA
women Carolan and Nelson showed that AMA
women who were in good health during pregnancy were
surprised to learn that they were in fact classified in a high
risk category due to their age As already stated knowing
themselves to be in a high risk group can have a negative
impact on older pregnant women causing them additional
concern and leading them to seek higher levels of health
monitoring during pregnancy Zasloff et al found
that women over years were more worried about the baby
compared with younger women However knowing
themselves to be at risk does not necessarily prevent the
natural positive feelings of pregnancy from being
experienced although older women do seem to need to be
reassured more often that everything is well Pregnant
women years of age or older often wanted additional
ultrasonic scans and genetic testing to be assured that
nothing was wrong Robb et al found no

correlation between maternal age and emotional distress in
primigravidas when comparing pregnant women aged and
over to those aged years Feelings during pregnancy
were mainly positive or anxious described using phrases
such as being delighted overjoyed and extremely lucky
or worried about the baby AMA women also
appreciated the support received from healthcare providers
during the genetic testing process
Carolan and Nelson found that although AMA
women were generally pleased with the care received they
considered healthcare providers attitudes towards their
concerns to be somewhat insensitive and dismissive Older
pregnant women also expressed a need for more time for
discussion during maternity care visits Robb et al
again highlighted the importance of healthcare providers being
aware how the concept of risk is assimilated by AMA mothers
since the apparent over concern of health care professionals
towards maternal and foetal well being can increase the stress
levels of pregnant women Older pregnant women also benefit
from being given some favourable or positive information
related to delayed childbearing and motherhood as the
reassurance derived from this decreases stress Women over
years did not generally have negative feelings about the
forthcoming birth of their children but they did find childbirth a
more difficult experience compared with younger women
DISCUSSION
In the Western world the average age at which first time
mothers give birth is continually rising Complications and
risks associated with pregnancy among women of AMA have
been addressed in numerous studies from different viewpoints
mostly focusing on the medical risks associated with higher
maternal age The purpose of this review was to profile how
women over years and the associated pregnancy related risks
have been described in previous research
Studies examined in this review have shown an increased
likelihood of certain medical complications among women
of AMA However when exploring the risks associated with
AMA it is important to consider the influence of
confounding variables such as marital status economic
status smoking parity BMI pre existing diagnoses history
of using medications before conception and previous
adverse prenatal outcome
While the experiences and knowledge of the older
pregnant woman are described in the present review the role
of a father and family is not covered Although it was not in
the search terms for this review it appears to be a subject
area that has not been well addressed in the literature thus
how fathers experience later childbearing is not well known
Most studies reviewed here focused on the association
between AMA and its related risks while only a few focused
on the experiences of pregnancy in general
In summary during pregnancy women over years
prepare for pregnancy gather information receive
information from healthcare providers and worry about their
pregnancy and their status of being at risk Nevertheless
these women also experience positive feelings One of the
major difficulties to address is that while these women want
to be as well informed and prepared as possible the
information they receive can cause more anxiety rather than
alleviate their concerns There are therefore

challenges for maternity care workers to understand the
importance of a holistic approach which takes into
consideration the individual physical emotional and social
needs of older childbearing women
Included in the present review are studies that were
conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods The
original data varied from responses to small qualitative
interviews to large data sets obtained from birth certificates or
other archived records The majority of the studies reviewed
here were carried out in the USA Canada UK and Australia
but interestingly among these the number conducted in nursing
science was relatively small Although the phenomenon of later
childbearing is common in developed countries an analysis of
the experiences of pregnant women in Europe is still needed in
order to determine the most suitable ways in which maternity
care should be structured to meet the individual needs of AMA
women
This review is limited to the small number of relevant
studies that the literature search which focused on advanced
maternal age was able to retrieve Although AMA is
associated with increased pregnancy related risks and other
complications by excluding these and other specific search
terms the search results may have been constrained
However the principal aim was to gather information
specifically on older pregnant women for which purpose the
terms used in the search were relevant and verified by a
specialist librarian The search terms used should have
returned literature that encompassed the specific risk issues
related to AMA but they may not necessarily have done so
As already stated the number of studies included in this
review was quite small This was partly due to the fact that
all studies relating to either postnatal issues or to specific
medical problems associated with pregnancy in older
women were excluded Any literature not published in
English would also have been excluded from the search It
may be fair to criticise the exclusion criteria used for the
present review however the studies that were finally
included formed quite a diverse selection and the overall
breadth of issues covered in them means that the conclusions
that can be drawn from the present review are valuable
relevant and usable
It is important to remember that most women of AMA
give birth at term without experiencing adverse maternal or
prenatal outcomes Furthermore the fact that absolute
rates of prenatal mortality morbidity are low suggests that
the majority of older women do have a desirable outcome to
their pregnancy The level of information provided to an
AMA woman concerning the risks that similar women
might experience during pregnancy and the manner in which
such information is given during maternity care should
depend on her health status her existing knowledge and her
need for information This requires careful judgement by a
sensitive communicative healthcare professional who is
able to develop a good patient provider interaction and who
can allow and make available sufficient time for discussion
Older pregnant women must be made aware of the risks
related to later childbearing in order that they might be able
to make informed decisions about whether or not to become
pregnant but they should also be made aware of the
probability of successfully reach full term and of having a
completely problem free pregnancy and birth

CONCLUSION
Pregnant women over years old have issues and
concerns to which healthcare providers must pay attention
when in professional contact with these women In order to
meet the needs of older pregnant women healthcare
providers themselves need more information concerning the
experiences of older women during pregnancy in order to
increase their understanding and knowledge of age related
pregnancy risks Healthcare providers should remember that
pregnancy can evoke a broad range of feelings in women of
advanced maternal age which can vary from happiness to
anxiety
This review illustrates the importance of the nature of
available information and how it is given to older pregnant
women Older pregnant women have a desire for knowledge
and they are active information seekers Information given
by healthcare providers is therefore important for older
pregnant women during their process of becoming mothers
It is especially important that each woman of AMA should
be treated as an individual and not simply as a member of a
certain group Being aware of the diverse experiences of
older pregnant women can help healthcare providers to
understand better the needs of these women Such awareness
can also help health care providers to realize that it is
important to offer AMA women not only risk oriented
information but favourable information concerning later
childbearing as well In order to be a successful healthcare
provider they should consider their own persona
