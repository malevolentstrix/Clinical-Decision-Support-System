ch presents womenS experiences with and
perceptions of turnaway from receiving a method of FP in two districts
in Malawi Nearly all the reasons described for being turned away were
medically incorrect preventable and potentially harmful to women
seeking FP Clients described how not receiving FP on time either new
methods or resupplies was stressful for them and had real implications
Whether clients had to return to search for methods another day refrain
from sexual relations or adopt a second choice method it caused them
worry and inconvenience Although none of our participants mentioned
being pregnant at the time of the FGDs they discussed it as a possibility
Three additional reasons for turnaway were mentioned by women in
the FGDs that were not seen in the survey results Peterson et al
include provider refusal charging of informal fees and late arrival
Provider refusal included providers being tired or needing a
Table
break or giving preferential services for women assumed to be well
to do Providers charging informal fees another category of turnaway
not seen in survey results and preferential treatment have been seen
before for example in Kenya Tanzania Uganda Sierra Leone and
Malawi
Busse et al Tumlinson et al Tumlinson et al
Hunt Pieterse and Lodge Mamba et al
Identifying these barriers in interviews with the women seeking the
services but not in the survey illustrates the importance of applying
multiple research methods in exploring care seeking behaviour and its
outcome These practices raise issues of inequity of access to FP based on
socioeconomic status or personal connections to providers and should be
studied further to design and implement interventions to prevent them
Late arrival the third new category of reasons for turnaway
mentioned during the FGDs could be another aspect of inequity in
service delivery resulting from financial status women who cannot
afford to use transportation methods such as mini buses taxis or bicycle
taxis might be more likely to arrive late Women who live further from
facilities may also find it more difficult to arrive at a facility early in the
morning The impact of these potential inequities should be considered
when formal or informal policies on the availability of FP services based
on the day of the week or time of arrival at the facility are implemented

Stratton et al
The women frequently mentioned the need to be currently
Midwifery
menstruating to receive a method In the era of cheap accurate preg
nancy tests estimated to cost a facility US O US O each in
Malawi in this requirement seems unnecessary Kolesar et al
Also Malawian providers pre service training materials include
the option for providers to rule out pregnancy in many cases through the
use of the Reasonably Sure Not Pregnant Checklist
Kolesar et al
Although
Ministry of Health and IntraHealth International
providers usually do not control whether a pregnancy test is available at
a facility they could use this checklist more frequently to rule out
pregnancy Peterson et al For the women needing to come to a
facility when menstruating is both costly and inconvenient and presents
extra challenges and added stress Peterson et al At the same
time the providers are navigating the dilemma of potentially initiating a
method to a pregnant woman against preventing a loss in confidence in
the effectiveness of modern FP methods
In the FGDs the women felt especially frustrated being scheduled for
re injection of injectable contraception on a non FP day refused that
day and then denied a re injection again for coming in a day or two late
on the closest FP day to their scheduled appointments Officially
Malawi follows the World Health Organization s medical eligibility
criteria which state that women can come up to two weeks before or
four weeks after a scheduled appointment date to receive a re injection
but this does not appear to happen consistently in practice Ministry of
Health and IntraHealth International As noted by one partici
pant asking women who are current users of injectables to wait until
they begin menstruating again seems unreasonable especially given
that this can take several months
DEPO PROVERA medrox
yprogesterone acetate injection spi Providing FP services daily is
in line with MOHP expectations and is reasonable particularly for
re injections which require little time for counselling
Stock outs of supplies and methods lead to turnaway but are nor
mally out of the control of individual providers A worldwide shortage of
injectable contraception in due to the shutdown of a manufacturer
sterilizing facility U S Food and Drug Administration
likely
affected the supply of injectables in Malawi during our research In
addition ordering and delivering commodities is a complex process
involving a host of players including pharmacy technicians FP co
ordinators working for the Reproductive Health Unit in the MOHP the
MOHP Health Technical Services and Support Unit and the Central
Medical Stores Trust which is responsible for procurement
Govern
ment of Malawi This system has been noted to lack account
ability perhaps allowing individual providers to sell methods on the side
Government of Malawi an issue raised by the women These
findings are in line with other research in Malawi showing the leakage
of essential drugs from official health facility stocks as well as the fre
quency with which others have seen official drugs being sold through
unofficial channels Carlson et al Msoma et al
Conse
quently to effectively limit turnaway of women seeking FP and support
the providers better control around essential drugs is crucial
The FGD highlighted turnaway resulting from having too few pro
viders or providers not trained on all methods Low caregiver to patient
ratios are seen throughout sub Saharan Africa including in Malawi
where there are just seven nurses or midwives per people World
Health Organization Providers in Malawi have expressed
frustration with being short staffed or not having staff trained in all
methods Peterson et al Mwafulirwa et al
Overworked providers grow weary and frustrated when
et al
they cannot keep up with their workloads or do not have the supplies
and training needed to do so Yet lashing out at clients or treating them
in a rude and disrespectful manner as described in the FGDs and re
ported elsewhere Tumlinson et al Nalwadda et al
Mannava et al is unacceptable Furthermore providers should
not partake in selective practices with women who appear to be
financially advantaged having better access to services and methods
than those judged to be poorer as was described in the FGD
Stock outs and staffing issues including training on all methods as
J M Peterson et al
well as client eligibility are systemic challenges that should be
addressed by the MOHP and district authorities For example providers
should know that clients should be able to receive progesterone only
pills any time after delivery and that an IUD can be inserted within
hours of delivery or after four weeks as well as the medical eligibility
criteria for reinjections of injectable contraception Ministry of Health
and IntraHealth International Efforts should also be made at a
systemic level to eliminate the occurrence of providers privately selling
methods acquired through unofficial channels or giving preferential
treatment to some clients Providing turned away clients with alterna
tive options such as referrals to other means of initiating FP through
outreach facilities or HSAs and talking to them consistently about
second choice methods are other practical steps that can be taken to
ensure the FP needs of women in Malawi are met in a timely manner
In this study Malawian women draw attention to their experiences
of being turned away when seeking FP Most of the reasons they high
light are preventable indicating that these barriers can be removed if
there is a will for systemic changes and if providers adopt a client
centred approach that enables easy access to the methods of contra
ception Malawian women need and are entitled to receive If these
barriers are addressed while giving due attention to the provider per
spectives Peterson et al policymakers and program imple
menters will be able to reduce FP turnaway not only in Malawi but with
potential implications elsewhere
A strength of this study is that it provides information on an
understudied area the impact of client turnaway on women and their
families in their own words The study is unique because it recruited
women who had been followed longitudinally to understand their ex
periences with and the outcomes of turnaway Another strength of the
research is the diversity of the research team The composition of the
team which included men and women Malawians and non Malawians
and a generational spread allowed us to reflect on how these and other
characteristics may have influenced the research and to attempt to
mitigate any personal interference in how the participant voices were
heard and understood Nonetheless the sample was limited to clients
with access to a mobile phone who were willing to be contacted two
factors that could bias the results The number of FGDs is another lim
itation the research struggled with sample size because it started just as
the COVID pandemic began when people were becoming wary of
going out or gathering with others Given that most of the reasons for
turnaway were discussed in multiple FGDs however we consider the
results a reliable representation of the range of reasons why women have
been turned away
Conclusions
Clients are turned away without a method of FP on the day they seek
one for multiple reasons nearly all of which are preventable Many ex
amples given by the participants showed a lack ofknowledge and respect
for clients on the part of the providers At the same time the practical
constraints experienced by the providers can not be underestimated and
need to be simultaneously addressed Thus health policymakers aiming
to improve FP services need to consider the perspectives of the FP pro
viders as well as those of the clients as presented here
Ensuring providers have a client centred attitude and improving
their morale motivation and practices could improve client provider
interactions Changing attitudes and behaviour however may be diffi
cult and will require additional steps such as additional training and
oversight In addition increasing the availability and use of pregnancy
tests having a more reliable supply of methods and materials increasing
the number of providers including those trained well in all method
s and providing daily FP services would all help reduce turnaway
Enabling all medically eligible women who are seeking a method of FP
to obtain one the day it is first sought will help Malawi and other low
and middle income countries achieve their SDGs in women and chil
dren s health and beyond

moderate to severe psoriasis by their physicians perceived severity ratings were significantly
higher among women Psoriasis affected the women s desire to become pregnant or led to
their delaying pregnancy in in respondents They were concerned that their condition might
worsen if they had to discontinue or switch treatment or that the treatment might harm the
baby Approximately half of the women had not received family planning counseling from their
physicians and this was more likely to be the case among never pregnant women Women on
biologic therapy had better psoriasis control and a better quality of life than women
on other treatments Their sexual health was also less affected
Conclusions Women with psoriasis have numerous family planning concerns which in some
cases can lead them to delay pregnancy or affect their desire to become pregnant Dermatolo
gists need to receive better training regarding family planning in women with psoriasis so that
they can provide their patients with more and better information

Psoriasis has a negative effect on patients quality of life
In Spain the prevalence of psoriasis is affecting appro
ximately million persons with little variation between the
sexes Onset is between the second and fourth decades
of life in of cases that is coinciding with a woman s
reproductive years causing concern and uncertainty with
respect to owing to the lack of information on
family planning pregnancy and breastfeeding According
to the BIOBADADERM registry women with moderate to
severe psoriasis in Spain are less likely to become pregnant
and breastfeed than the general population
The course of psoriasis during pregnancy is unpre
dictable Symptoms improve in around half of pregnant
women remain unchanged in others and worsen in more
than Moreover symptoms worsen after delivery in
Uncontrolled psoriasis during pregnancy is associated
with complications for both mother and fetus
While
many psoriasis treatments are potentially teratogenic
current therapeutic options are compatible with pregnancy
and breastfeeding
The main objectives of the present
study were as follows to determine the impact of psoriasis
on the desire to become pregnant and on breastfeeding to
learn more about the concerns and fears of women with the
disease before during and after pregnancy and to analyze
Til
N A Cantero R Ruiz Villaverde et al
the information on family planning pregnancy and breast
feeding they receive at the clinic with the aim of ensuring
that the information provided by their dermatologist is as
complete and exhaustive as possible depending on their indi
vidual needs The secondary objectives were to evaluate
differences in the impact of the disease concerns and infor
mation depending on whether the woman had been pregnant
or had a child treatment with biologics and disease activity
according to the patient or to the physician
Methods
We performed a multicenter cross sectional descriptive
observational study Patients were selected during visits to
the dermatologist at Spanish clinics and included between
March and October
Study Population
The study population comprised women with plaque pso
riasis aged years who were candidates for systemic
treatment and who agreed to participate in the study We
excluded patients with psoriatic arthritis to focus on the
skin and minimize variability patients who did not wish to
participate and patients who were not sufficiently literate
to participate
Variables and Data Collection
We collected clinical variables including the Psoriasis Area
Severity Index PASI Body Surface Area BSA perceived
activity of psoriasis by the physician on a visual analog scale
VAS comorbid conditions and previous and current
treatment Quality of life was evaluated using a qualitative
scale
Supplementary material and the Dermatology Life
Quality Index DLQI
Patients responded anonymously with their sociode
mographic data and their perception of the activity of
their psoriasis on a hard copy questionnaire The ques
tionnaire comprised items addressing family planning
and was specifically designed for the study Supplementary
material The investigators drafted the questionnaire ad
hoc for this project taking into account the study objec
tives Items and addressed concerns and information
before pregnancy and the impact of the disease Item
evaluated the impact of the disease on the patient s sexual
health Items addressed concerns and information
during pregnancy and items and addressed these
areas after pregnancy The remaining items assessed
information provided by the physician and other media
The results were used to prepare a table covering areas
to address during visits

Discussion
Recent studies indicate that women with moderate
to severe psoriasis in Spain are less likely to become
and less given to breastfeeding than the general
population The underlying reasons for this finding include
psychological causes feelings of low self esteem stigma
tization and a loss of confidence that leads to sexual
problems social and family related problems and concern
over the effects of treatment on the fetus Our survey
showed that more than of patients believed that if
they received more information from their physician they
would reconsider the desire to have children Therefore
in line with a recent consensus statement I we think
that physicians should be more proactive in providing this
information
Table
Psoriasis in women is diagnosed at a mean age of years
with initiation of treatment at years that is when
reproductive activity is highest In our study the mean age
was years and the disease had been progressing for
years therefore our study population is representative
of women during their peak reproductive period Psoria
sis has a considerable physical and emotional impact on
women affects their quality of life to a greater extent than
it does that of men affects their sexual relations and gen
erates uncertainty over the possible effects of the disease on
motherhood
Little is known about these aspects which
may be undervalued in clinical practice
Our cohort brings together patients with a significant
disease burden The impact of the disease reduces the
desire to become pregnant or delays pregnancy in one third
of patients The survey revealed some of the concerns
that could account for these fears which are associated
mainly with the safety of treatment the course of the
disease and the lack of information Most women are wor
ried that the treatment could harm the baby although
they are also concerned that the disease could worsen by
stopping or changing treatment before pregnancy during
pregnancy or during breastfeeding
The data suggest that the information provided in the
dermatology clinic on family planning desire to become
pregnant and safety of treatment is insufficient both
before conception and during pregnancy and breastfeeding
especially in women who have not previously been preg
nant We think that all women of reproductive age should
receive appropriate information at the clinic Moreover up
to of pregnancies are not planned therefore in line
with other authors we believe that women of reproduc
tive age should be provided with a treatment plan that is
compatible with pregnancy irrespective of their intentions
with respect to family planning Furthermore it is important
to train and improve the role of dermatologists as providers
of information on family planning
Our results suggest that women taking biologics are fol
lowed up more appropriately and have a better quality
of life with less impact of the disease on sexual health
than patients not taking biologics Treatment of psoriasis

After delivery
Course of psoriasis after

Possibility of breastfeeding
Concerns over whether children
will inherit psoriasis
Concern over whether psoriasis
limits appropriate care of children
Treatments to be avoided during
breastfeeding
aSourced from reliable information on family planning in women with psoriasis e g information from scientific societies or patient
associations analyzed by specialists
during pregnancy and breastfeeding is challenging for the
clinician
While numerous therapies with potential ter
atogenic effects must be withdrawn before conception
some treatments can be used safely during pregnancy and
breastfeeding and we should inform patients in this regard
Certolizumab pegol is the safest biologic in both pregnancy
and breastfeeding given that its passage across the pla
centa to the mother s milk is minimal or nonexistent
Pregnant women treated with biologics can continue treat
ment during the first and second trimesters The risks and
benefits of continuing treatment during the third trimester
can be discussed with the patient However patients tak
ing certolizumab pegol can continue to do so throughout
their pregnancy if considered clinically necessary as well
as during breastfeeding
It has been shown that in both healthy women
and in women with other chronic diseases
attitude
toward pregnancy is influenced by perception of risk
Chronic diseases are associated with various risks dur
ing pregnancy and the perception of risk is unique to
each individual and not based only on objective information
with respect to the risk Therefore further research
is necessary to understand women s perception of risk
in specific chronic diseases In addition efforts must be
made to improve the information provided to patients on
objective risks
In the specific case of psoriasis recent
guidelines address patient management
Our study is limited by its cross sectional descriptive
and observational design and the fact that it lacks a con
trol group comprising women without psoriasis or male
patients with psoriasis However we believe that our sam
ple is representative of women of reproductive age seen
at dermatology clinics in Spain and who provide some
indication of their needs and concerns with respect to
family planning Our findings lead us to believe that it is
essential to provide more information to patients at the
clinic
Conclusions
The results of our study suggest that psoriasis has an impact
on family planning and desire to become pregnant Various
concerns may affect a woman s desire to become preg
nant or delay pregnancy The information provided on these
aspects during follow up is not complete
