Abstract
Objective
The morbidity and mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage has been increased since in China
in addition promoting vaginal delivery is an important task in China currently This study aimed to
develop a clinical decision support system CDSS to predict postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal
delivery women
Design
A retrospective cohort study
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records among vaginal delivery women who had
visited the obstetrics clinic at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from to
these women then were randomly divided into a training set a validation set and a test set
We adopted a univariate logistic regression model to select the significant features P
Afterward we trained several artificial neural networks and binary logistic regression to predict the
postpartum hemorrhage the neural networks included multi layer perceptron MLP back propagation
BP and radial basis function RBF In order to compare and identify the most accurate network we
used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic ROC curve We finally developed a
clinical decision support system based on the most accurate network All statistical analyses were
performed by IBM SPSS version and MATLAB software was applied to develop the clinical
decision support system

Initially potential variables were addressed by the univariate logistic regression significant
predictors were then selected to enter the binary logistic regression and neural networks P value
After validation the best performing model was the multi layer perceptron network with the highest
discriminative ability AUC Cl Followed by the back propagation model AUC
Cl the logistic regression model AUC Cl The radial
basis function model AUC Cl had lower discriminative ability
Conclusion
Page
In summary in terms of predicting postpartum hemorrhage the multi layer perceptron network performed
better than the back propagation network logistic regression model and radial basis function network
The developed clinical decision support system based on the multi layer perceptron network is expected
to promote early identification of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery women thereby improve the
quality of obstetric care and the maternal outcome
What Is Already Known About The Topic
Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide
Due to the heterogeneity of discriminant criteria and risk factors between cesarean section and
vaginal delivery there are some limitations in predicting postpartum hemorrhage using the same
warning model for different mode of delivery
Current prediction models for postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery are linear algorithm that
divide events into possible or not possible However most obstetrics events are not as black and
white
What this paper adds
We developed the first midwifery led clinical decision support system model based on artificial neural
network ANN algorithm for prediction of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery
This study demonstrated that the multi layer perceptron MLP network had the most accurate
prediction ability followed by the back propagation BP network the logistic regression model and
the radial basis function RBF network
This study could enrich the practice of artificial intelligence in nursing informatization
Introduction
Postpartum hemorrhage PPH is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide
l it
accounting for of maternal deaths and of adverse pregnancy outcomes respectively
In
makes up of maternal deaths in developed countries while in developing countries
developed countries postpartum hemorrhage has fallen to the third as a direct cause of maternal death
after pregnancy hypertension and thromboembolism however it remains the leading cause of maternal
death in developing countries
In China with the opening of two child policy from more and more elderly pregnant women have
become the potential population of postpartum hemorrhage The increasing trial of labor after a previous
cesarean section TOLAC and elective repeated cesarean section ERCS caused by previous one child
policy also deteriorate the risk of obstetric hemorrhage Maternal mortality has been decreasing and
seems to reach a bottleneck since in China but the mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage is
Page
increasing compared with the maternal mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage increased by
in to and increased to in
The cesarean section rate in China rose from in to in far from the
recommended by the World Health Organization thereby promoting vaginal delivery is an important
task in Chinese obstetrics department now As a decision maker for early warning of postpartum
hemorrhage during the vaginal delivery midwives often rely on their own experience to judge and have
not yet formed a unified decision standard On the one hand prediction and decision making for
postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery is a formidable task for midwives Multiple factors have
varying influence on the occurrence of hemorrhage among vaginal delivery women nonlinear relations
between risk factors and postpartum hemorrhage make it more complicate as well On the other hand
the qualification of most Chinese midwives is college or technical secondary school education and
standardized training of midwives is low in China as well
The objective of this study is to develop a clinical decision support system CDSS to solve above
problems A clinical decision support system is invented to help physicians make appropriate decisions
for patients it uses artificial intelligence algorithm to solve semi structured or unstructured clinical
problem Clinical decision support system not only is a principle and method based on the knowledge
reasoning and logic operation to acquire and process relevant patient data from the electronic medical
records automatically but also is an auxiliary decision making system which provide decision makers
with valuable information at the right time by the human computer interaction Clinical decision
support system is considered to be the inevitable trend of the combination of medicine and artificial
intelligence Chinese government issued many policies to promote the sustainable development of
the notice of national hospital informatization construction focusing on
medical informatization
electronic medical records by the National Health Commission in pointed out that clinical
nursing decision support system should realize intelligent input intelligent generation intelligent
reminder quality control and rectification of nursing records and other functions
Data driven clinical decision support system based on a large amount of electronic medical record data
can be divided into case reasoning system and machine learning system a good machine learning
algorithms can extract personalized features from data and summarize patterns to achieve high
Current algorithms of prediction model for postpartum hemorrhage adopted by the
accuracy
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG and the California Maternal Quality Care
decision tree
Collaborative CMQCC include logistic regression
random forest and extreme
gradient boosting Most of them are linear prediction that divides events into possible or not possible
However as real life has shown most events are not as black and white Rather than other liner
algorithms artificial neural network ANN is a multi layer complex model formed by connecting neurons
perceptron through synapses weights ANN has strong nonlinear mapping ability to address high
dimensional data it can also reasonably predict and modify the relationship between input variables and
output variables ANN models possess strong feature of self adaption self organizing self learning and
Page
tolerate faults In recent years ANN has been applied to medical research such as prediction of
disease diagnosis and prognosis prediction of nursing adverse events which has proven high superiority
Therefore this study aims to build a scientific midwifery led clinical decision support system based on
ANN algorithm for prediction of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery which will provide a practical
theoretical basis for improving the success rate of treatment and reducing the mortality of postpartum
hemorrhage
Material And Methods
Data source and data collection
In order to identify the potential variables we first conducted a literature system review and a Delphi
method with obstetricians and midwives We adopted the search strategy to find relevant literature as
follows postpartum hemorrhage OR PPH OR transfusion AND predictor OR risk factor AND vaginal
delivery OR vaginal birth in PubMed Web of Science Embase Springer Elsevier SD and Wiley We read
related papers published in English from Moreover we considered current medical evidence and
obstetricians consultations We identified potential variables regarding this however five of these
variables residence history of postpartum hemorrhage pre pregnancy weight antenatal steroids and
antepartum infection were not registered in the electronic medical records Hence we designed the data
collection form and collected another variables manually Appendix The needed data was
retrospectively collected from the medical records of vaginal delivery women who had visited the
obstetrics clinic at our hospital the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University in Zhengzhou
China from to We also tried to use the Maternal and Child Health Information Network of
Henan Province to collect large data but some essential elements were not available in the information
system so we collected complete data manually Two trained researchers first author and second
author extracted the data from the electronic medical records
Out of registered vaginal deliveries from the electronic medical records we excluded any patients
who underwent antenatal fetal demise gestations under weeks caesarean section late
postpartum hemorrhage hematological and neoplastic disorders severe liver diseases
incomplete medical records and death before childbirth According to these criteria only
of these deliveries were available and eligible for study The final dataset included the potential
predictor variables and bleeding or not outcomes of these cases Next these women were randomly
divided into a training set a validation set and a test set
Pre processing and feature selection
The outcomes event of postpartum hemorrhage was defined as blood loss at least within
hours after the fetus is vaginally delivered This outcome was selected because it was consistent with the
most recent definition from Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage
Page
issued by Obstetrics Division Obstetrics and Gynecology Branch Chinese Medical Association
the literature of obstetrics and gynecology published by People s Medical Publishing House in
Edition
as well as the consensus definition of the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists and the World Health Organization
There were data values missing for some variables we used the multiple imputation to impute missing
data values for variables in model This approach has been recommended by the prediction model risk of
bias assessment tool PROBAST and applied in previous study
Numerous variables will lead to over fitting of the model and increase the clinic burden Therefore the pre
processing techniques were frequently used to reduce dimension or select feature This step can
eliminate irrelevant weakly relevant or less important features Variable screening is an important
procedure to improve the overall stability of the model We selected variables using the backward
method and the univariate logistic regression performed by IBM SPSS software version variables
were finally identified as input neurons and the standardized importance of each variable was shown on
a scale with a maximum value of to understand the contribution of each variable in the machine
learning model Fig
Establishment of artificial neural network models and
logistic regression LR model
The artificial neural networks and LR models of postpartum hemorrhage were built based on the
identified predictors from the previous step

neuron is the basic component of the network Neurons include input neurons hidden layer neurons and
output neurons MLP is a multi layer feedforward neural network it has advantages of processing
nonlinear data good fault tolerance and strong self learning ability The MLP network model can pass
the data among each neuron in direction and excavate the internal deep connections between the input
data whose learning process mainly includes the forward transmission of data and the back propagation
of errors This kind of feedback learning method can reasonably change the weight and bias of each
input so that obtain the best prediction ability for the model The number of neurons in hidden layer
can be automatically calculated by SPSS software and the relative optimal number of neurons can be
get
The Back Propagation BP network
BP neural network is multi layer feedforward neural network based on gradient descent algorithm it is
trained according to the error back propagation algorithm and has been the most widely used neural
network which is composed of input layer hidden layer and output layer Activation function between

layer and layer is Sigmoid type differentiable function the error is propagated back to the input layer from
back to front layer by layer the link weight is adjusted constantly in order to realize arbitrary nonlinear
mapping between input and output The internal Sigmoid function was automatically calculated
by SPSS and the relative optimal function parameters were obtained
The radial basis function RBF network
The RBF neural network consists of input layer radial basis layer and output layer the input layer is made
up of signal source nodes the radial basis layer is a nonlinear radially symmetric function that is
attenuated to the center point according to specific needs the output layer is the output result of input
layer processed by radial basis function RBF neural network is a kind of forward conduction neural
network which is applicable to solve classification problems It can approximate any continuous function
with any precision so that achieve the optimal prediction ability by adjusting the parameters of the radial
The internal radial basis function was automatically calculated by SPSS and the
basis function
relative optimal function parameters were obtained
Evaluation of the networks and development of the
CDSS
Firstly in order to identify the best performed model based on a given dataset we not only developed five
models for the MLP network RBF network and BP network respectively but also constructed the binary
logistic regression to compare the performance of the traditional statistical analysis model and the
artificial neural network model Secondly the receiver operating characteristic ROC curves of each
model in training set validation set test set were plotted by R software We used the area under the
receiver operating characteristic AUROC sensitivity specificity and accuracy to evaluate and select the
most accurate model In addition we also conducted the internal validation by fold cross Finally we
designed the CDSS based on the most accurate network by MATLAB software to reach
visualization

Discussion
We preliminarily constructed and validated three ANN models to predict postpartum hemorrhage in
vaginal delivery women The MLP model indicated the best predictive ability in all groups of training
validation and test Moreover compared with the traditional logistic regression model both MLP and BP
models showed better discrimination ability to predict postpartum hemorrhage In addition A user
friendly CDSS was developed according to the MLP model
In terms of clinical application midwives could prepare full in advance for example triage expectant
mothers with high risk of postpartum hemorrhage to the corresponding obstetric care level and initiate
interventions Prediction of our model mainly focused on the time of labor and birth therefore we
adopted the variables available during the same instances It is also appropriate to construct prediction
model employing high risk factors after delivery such as cervical lacerations and newborn weight
Importantly in order to facilitate clinical use immediately we recommend the information departments in
hospital to integrate the aid decision making system in electronic medical records in the form of a risk
calculator or outputting the result automatically When a pregnant woman is laboring by an obstetrician
the midwife or other assistant could input the numerical values of the predictors into the built CDSS
Fig and the prediction outcome postpartum hemorrhage or non postpartum hemorrhage would be
output by clicking the button of submit in the designed interface of the system Once the system
identifies some pregnancy women as postpartum hemorrhage the one should be considered carefully by
the obstetricians According to the predicted outcome the obstetricians can make optimal decision for
the pregnancy women about personalized treatment in the next step In this way the obstetrician can
manage the labor stage more skillfully by early identification early warning early treatment in order to
mitigate adverse outcome for these high risk patients For example midwives can make pre transfusion
preparations for high risk patients in advance cross match blood tests and inform the blood transfusion
department to prepare blood products particularly fresh frozen plasma can take up an hour to thaw At
the same time it is conducive to the rational allocation of medical resources by arranging high risk
bleeding women for delivering in different time to avoid insufficient staff resources
In recent years medical institutions and obstetric experts at home and abroad have made a lot of
exploration in the early warning evaluation and prediction of postpartum hemorrhage The risk score
calculators formulated by them for different subgroups of people could indicate the possibility of
postpartum hemorrhage to some extent and achieved certain results Ana developed and validated a
predictive model based on the binary logistic regression and the ridge regression to measure the risk of
excessive blood loss in vaginal delivery women but this analysis only collected thirteen variables
and the sensitivity was low Michelle trained and tested a logistic regression prediction models
involving variables for hemorrhage and transfusion by a data set from deliveries however the
results were not visualized Kartic et al used two traditional statistical models logistic regression with
and without lasso regularization and two machine learning models random forest and extreme gradient
boosting to predict postpartum hemorrhage the extreme gradient boosting model showed the best in
both the discrimination and decision curve analysis but some variables in the model were difficult to
Page
collect so that limited the clinical practicability Ahmadzia et al developed an online calculator for
postpartum hemorrhage risk scores Dunkerton et al established a decision tree model for postpartum
hemorrhage prediction based on a non parametric recursion algorithm Bingnan Chen
created a
nomogram model to predict postpartum hemorrhage individually however all of them were only used for
cesarean section population Due to the heterogeneity of discriminant criteria and risk factors between
cesarean section and vaginal delivery there are some limitations in predicting postpartum hemorrhage
using the same warning model for different mode of delivery In addition most of current prediction
models for postpartum hemorrhage were linear algorithms logistic regression is a traditional statistics
algorithm which can screen out the limited variables associated with postpartum hemorrhage and
eliminate confounding variables However when there are too many variables to observe the LR
neither detect complicated nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables nor has
the ability to address collinearity between variables so some potential valid variables were removed
Compare with above models our study indicated that both neural network and logistic regression can
provide excellent discrimination for the prediction of postpartum hemorrhage hence a finally selected
model to build a CDSS should rely on a combination of model performance discrimination calibration
and net benefit clinical applicability and acceptability by obstetricians and expectant women
The ANN prediction model established in this paper aims to provide personalized prediction results and
achieve effective risk stratification The results of our study revealed that the ANN model was more
accurate to predict postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal delivery At present the ANN model has been
widely used in disease prediction and diagnosis chronic disease management medical image
recognition and other aspects it had shown superior performance than conventional predictive
models even employing the same input variables Postpartum hemorrhage as an obstetric
emergency has various factors and complex mechanism If we take the epidemiological data and use the
traditional linear discriminant function to predict it there are great limitations As an information
processing system abstracted from biological neural network ANN has the ability of self learning and
identifying the relationship between variables which can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions with
arbitrary accuracy Previous studies implied that neural network models reflected a stronger fit to
address complex nonlinear relationships and cost less effort to generate than the traditional regression
algorithms It is imperative that ANN techniques automatically conduct variables selection missing
values imputing and other data preprocessing procedures
There was a lot of literature support for the included variables as risk factors for PPH Almost all the
variables in our model are clinically available and have been identified in previous models including
newborn weight cervical laceration history of uterine surgery parity manual removal of placenta
episiotomy However one important predictor that has not been considered yet is the WBC count
during the first stage of labor it is identified of importance in this study which extended the
previous work in predicting PPH and may provide insights of underlying pathophysiology links between
inflammation participation and PPH onset In our results the WBC count of hemorrhage women were
higher than that of non hemorrhage women during the first stage of labor Possible reasons for this may
Page
be as follows infection leads to weak state of pregnancy women and those were vulnerable to PPH and
labor is a state of stress which also leads high WBC count Further more clinical laboratory studies
are needed to uncover the underlying pathophysiology mechanism between high WBC count during the
first stage of labor and postpartum hemorrhage Our outcomes for the WBC showed a standardized
importance this point maybe because the sample size was large but the morbidity of PPH was low and
the number of cases was small in this model Nevertheless another statistical algorithm was conducted
binary logistic regression to explore the odds ratio OR of the variables and confirm their statistical
significance
The second important risk factor was the newborn weight of standardized importance in our study
which again matched previous studies This may because that increased newborn weight is
associated with hyperextension of uterine muscle fibers and affects uterine contractions In addition
pregnant women with large fetal weight may have other complications such as cephalic pelvic
asymmetricity prolonged first and second stages of labor shoulder dystocia laceration of the soft birth
canal uterine contraction which also increases the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage The
newborn weight in our study was postpartum variable when the risk period of bleeding had passed we
can consider introducing a prenatal diagnosis of macrosomia or estimated fetal weight according to the
ultrasound into model Some other risk factors in our model for hemorrhage have been accepted
generally namely operative vaginal delivery induced labor manual removal of placenta episiotomy and
despite their fewer links to hemorrhage with standardized importance less than
cervical tears
the less noticeable whose effect is the more severe the situation goes
Limitations
Our study has several limitations Firstly neural network algorithms are driven by big data and rely on a
large sample size We developed a CDSS based on electronic medical record from only one center the
sample size was far insufficient the external validation was just conducted in our hospital so the result
may be not generalizable robust internal and external validation is needed before promotion and
application widely Secondly Missing data is another limitation of our study the study was restricted in
the part of valid blood loss data from the original dataset the missing value of the covariable accounted
for a considered proportion though we adopted multiple imputation techniques reported by the PROBAST
the proportion of incomplete data also limited the generalization of the model Furthermore it is more
likely that the missing values will continue to hinder integrating the models into electronic medical
records Thirdly the predictors in our study all were static hourly data such as temperature heart rate
systolic blood pressure oxygen saturation physical examination findings were not included
In addition despite embedding all risk factors in the CDSS will be promising but it may increase clinical
workload burden and could potentially delay intervention The impact of a model on aiding decision
making depends on multiple characteristics of health providers and circumstances including ability to
initiate immediately intervene response and weigh the risks against benefits capacity to take actions and
Page
Other
expectant women or obstetricians compliance with the recommended measures
environmental restrictions consist of staff space and facilities which are not considered into current
CDSS Meanwhile estimated blood loss EBL is considered to be inaccurate subjective and always
underestimated there is a mismatch between the actual blood loss and the vital signs urine volume and
mental state of the individual shown A physical compensatory period of blood loss exists in the early
bleeding stage Our definition of postpartum hemorrhage followed the current clinical guidelines
however we did not evaluate other relevant clinical indicators of acute blood loss including a deep
perineal hematoma from a laceration of the birth canal blood flow velocity and properties the bleeding
was fluid or turbulent or exudative and whether it clotted or contained clots The blood loss in
predictive models needs to be measured by means of the quantitative blood loss QBL methods such as
basic methemoglobin colorimetric method or image spectral analysis Shock Index Sl and so
on
Conclusions
In summary we developed a CDSS based on the risk factors identified by artificial neural network
algorithms This ANN model performed better than logistic regression in predicting the postpartum
hemorrhage of vaginal delivery women In the future these findings will enrich nursing informational
practice to promote the application of artificial intelligence technology such as ANN algorithm in the
field of nursing As predictive tools become more widely used in obstetric care they can be introduced
into clinical guidelines and care pathways after further testing Identification high risk mother of
postpartum hemorrhage on labor admission using the clinical decision making system will benefit
accurate prenatal diagnosis and prompt intervention which may lead to optimize obstetric care improve
maternal prognosis and rational allocation of medical resource
