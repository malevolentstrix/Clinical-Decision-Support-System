um and I understand but
all they cared about was the baby the baby the baby the baby
but okay if the baby is the baby the baby the baby what about
hydrating me so that the baby is well you know
Um it was traumatic I mean he was preemie The nurses were super
mean to me at the hospital You know every time I would go and
and visit you know he was in an incubator I could barely touch
him They d look at me and they d be like Look at him Look look
at what you did to your son So it was fucked up My mom visited
him more in the hospital than I did I just couldn t bear to take my
you know to go because they were just so fucking mean
Like at one point I seriously like like thought about just giving
birth at home Seriously For fear of them taking my child away at
the hospital when and because of the usage and like you know
once you re in the hospital setting like you can t just leave You
can t leave with your child They re gonna take the child because
they re gonna test their first urine And and it s downhill from
there I have no faith in the you know child protective services
people They re liars They you know they they set you up I
I think for for failure So I really considered just having my baby at
home and trying to you know Google that shit like how to have
a home birth Yeah That s how how fearful I was of of losing yet
again another child and not having family there for the support
In addition to the experience of being stigmatised in healthcare settings the
threat of child welfare involvement or possible criminalisation is also a the real
ity for women who use drugs The United States has an extensive history of puni
tive laws towards women who use drugs during pregnancy laws that are primarily
implemented through policing surveillance and child removal by the state Cur
rently punitive laws far outnumber the existing evidence based supportive policies
Thomas TrefTers Berglas Drabble Roberts While no law currently exists
explicitly criminalising drug use during pregnancy states have sought prosecution
against pregnant people who use drugs in a variety of ways such as declaring prenatal
Overdose Risks and Prevention Strategies for Pregnant Women
drug use as a form of child maltreatment doing drug testing without informed con
sent ordering treatment through civil commitment and mandating child welfare
notifications Thomas Treffers Berglas Drabble Roberts While an analysis
of the extent of these punitive policies is beyond the scoop of this article it is clear
that many of these policies violate basic human rights of pregnant women who use
drugs Notably the overwhelming majority of parents involved in drug related child
welfare investigations are primarily low income and disproportionately women of
colour Stone There is no evidence that prosecution or the threat of prosecu
tion deters drug use in pregnancy Patrick Schiff In fact research shows
that the threat of child welfare involvement instead deters many women from seek
ing healthcare including prenatal care supportive social structures evidenced based
drug treatment or overdose prevention Hui Angelotta Fisher Nielsen
et al Stone However opioid use during pregnancy is an easily treatable
temporary and non life threatening condition with no evidence of long term health
consequences for the newborn Mangat Kraft Thus punitive
measures are counterproductive to the health of pregnant women and newborns
Because I think they re at higher risk for overdose because they use
alone they use in secrecy Um you know the baby is is you know
pretty much taking half of what is going in their system so they re
feeling the effects less so they they might increase their amount of
usage which puts them at a higher risk of overdose
The participant s statement above noted several important overdose risk con
siderations specifically for drug using pregnant women an often overlooked
population in overdose prevention education While there is extensive research
in treating opioid use disorder during pregnancy with the use of buprenorphine
or methadone which is also shown to significantly reduce the risk of an opioid
overdose little research exists on responding to an opioid overdose to a preg
nant person with the use of naloxone World Health Organization WHO
There is a critical need to expand overdose prevention education for the pregnant
population Women who are pregnant may use alone due to increased stigma by
drug using peers partners or family members Using alone poses a significant
risk of dying from an overdose since it is unlikely that a bystander could intervene
with the use of naloxone To be clear naloxone should always be administered to
anyone experiencing an overdose regardless of pregnancy Blandthorn Bowman
Leung Bonomo Dietze While none of the interviewed participants had
heard anything about specific considerations when administering naloxone to a
pregnant woman a frequent inquiry at overdose prevention trainings all par
ticipants were correct when assuming pregnancy should never be a reason not to
give someone naloxone based on the medication s life saving purpose
But it s better to have someone alive whether they re pregnant or
not than to have someone two people dead as opposed to two
people the mother overdosing and the fetus dying in the process
Additionally the postpartum period creates a unique overdose risk for women
who have experienced pregnancy The limited research suggests that some factors
Bethany Medley
associated with overdose in the postpartum period include poor social sup
port inadequate healthcare coverage and recently having an infant experienc
ing neonatal abstinence syndrome Nielsen et al Similarly women may
self medicate with continued or increased drug use due to stress and trauma asso
ciated with the loss of child custody or child welfare involvement as one partici
pant described
The pregnancies where I was using probably increased after birth
only because of the you know just the shitty feeling the depres
Sion associated with the fact that I knew that I wouldn t be able to
take my baby home or be with my baby
Conclusion
This brief documentation sheds light on women not only surviving the overdose
crisis but also the punitive stigmatising multi structural social systems that often
affect intersecting with the lives of pregnant women who use drugs Several areas
of further research and programme development were highlighted including the
need for gender responsive overdose prevention provisions barriers to reproduc
tive health and harm reduction as well as effective interventions with supportive
trauma informed approaches Women who use drugs have proven their expertise
in identifying several devastatingly harmful barriers to their own care and criti
cal life saving interventions Policymakers researchers and practitioners need to
ensure that women are no longer adversely impacted by ineffective and harmful
policies and practices which can be accomplished by collectively increasing advo
cacy efforts to promote the inclusive involvement of women with lived experience
of pregnancy and drug use throughout the development evaluation and imple
mentation of impacting systems and policies

Maternal and Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality Among Pregnant Women With and Without COVID Infection
t the outset of the COVID pandemic the precise ex
tent of the risks in pregnancy was uncertain which was
affecting pregnant individuals mental health
The lack of clarity arose because in an early systematic
review only studies that involved small numbers com
pared outcomes between pregnant women with and without
COVID The question is relevant because of the known
deleterious effects of other coronavirus infections in preg
nancy eg severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East
respiratory syndrome Therefore the INTERGROWTH
Consortium conducted a prospective longitudinal observa
tional study INTERCOVID involving hospitals in coun
tries to assess the association between COVID and mater
nal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID
diagnosis compared with concomitantly enrolled pregnant
women without COVID diagnosis
Methods
Study Design
The Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee and all local
ethics committees approved the study which did not inter
fere with clinical management Informed consent oral or writ
ten was obtained from study participants according to local
requirements except when a waiver exemption of such con
sent was granted by a local committee We adhered to the
Declaration of and Good Clinical Practice guide
lines The study protocol including the laboratory tests used
has been previously published
For months from March we enrolled women
years or older at any stage of pregnancy or delivery with the
diagnosis ofCOVID during the present pregnancy based on
laboratory confirmation of COVID and or radiologic pul
monary findings suggestive of COVID or or more pre
defined COVID symptoms A range of different real time
polymerase chain reaction and antibody tests were used at par
ticipating institutions eBox in the Supplement Two imme
diately concomitant pregnant women years or older with
out any of those diagnostic criteria were enrolled per woman
with COVID diagnosis to create an unbiased sample of all
pregnant women without COVID diagnosis in these insti
tutions Women were enrolled from institutions in coun
tries Argentina Brazil Egypt France Ghana India Indone
sia Italy Japan Mexico Nigeria North Macedonia Pakistan
Russia Spain Switzerland UK and the US Data on race were
not collected
When a woman with a COVID diagnosis was identified
antenatally women without COVID diagnosis of similar
gestational age weeks receiving standard antenatal care
were enrolled that day If not possible or ifthose women with

Key Points
Question To what extent does COVID in pregnancy alter the
risks of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with
pregnant individuals without COVID
Findings In this multinational cohort study of pregnant
women in countries women with COVID diagnosis were at
increased risk of a composite maternal morbidity and mortality
index Newborns of women with COVID diagnosis had
significantly higher severe neonatal morbidity index and severe
perinatal morbidity and mortality index compared with newborns
of women without COVID diagnosis
Meaning This study indicates a consistent association between
pregnant individuals with COVID diagnosis and higher rates of
adverse outcomes including maternal mortality preeclampsia
and preterm birth compared with pregnant individuals without
COVID diagnosis
proached until women without COVID diagnosis were en
rolled per woman with COVID diagnosis We sought con
firmation from a biweekly random sample that the
women without COVID diagnosis were appropriately cho
sen we excluded women who had a COVID diagnosis and
the corresponding women without a COVID diagnosis
without such confirmation Live and stillborn singleton and
multiple pregnancies were included including those with con
genital anomalies However in keeping with reporting require
ments during the pandemic we excluded women neonates
from the final analysis if their data were already published in
any comparative study with women without COVID
diagnosis
Outcomes
The primary were unweighted indices ma
ternal morbidity and mortality index including at least of the
following pregnancy related morbidities third trimester vagi
nal bleeding pregnancy induced hypertension preeclampsia

Data Management and Statistical Analysis
We used a centrally coordinated data management system de

sociations between being diagnosed as having COVID and
morbidity mortality indices expressed as binary outcomes
were assessed using Poisson models with a log link function
and robust standard errors expressed as relative risk RR and

sessed using negative binomial models with robust standard
errors expressed as an incidence rate ratio and CI We
set statistical significance at P Models for our primary
outcomes were adjusted for country month entering study ma
ternal age and history of maternal morbidity including dia
betes thyroid and other endocrine disorders cardiac dis
ease hypertension chronic respiratory disease kidney disease
malaria or tuberculosis Models with preterm birth as an out
come were also adjusted for previous preterm birth We plotted
Kaplan Meier curves with the percentage of women remain
ing pregnant by gestational age to compare the distributions
between women with and without COVID diagnosis ac
cording to symptom status We evaluated women with
COVID diagnosis for the primary and secondary outcomes
using the women without COVID diagnosis as the refer
ence group We further categorized women with COVID di
agnosis as asymptomatic or symptomatic based on type and
duration of symptoms as well as according to past maternal
morbidity and normal weight or overweight to explore effect
modification We assessed the association of neonates test
ing positive for SARS CoV infection In separate sensitivity
analyses we adjusted for additional potential confounders re
stricted the definition of women with COVID diagnosis to
mothers with a positive laboratory test result and excluded
twins We also performed separate meta analyses for our pri
mary outcomes of interest using the stratified results to esti
mate pooled effects and assess heterogeneity by country
Results

comitant pregnant women without COVID diagnosis from

tion bias
We demonstrated that women with COVID diagnosis
compared with those without COVID diagnosis were at sub
stantially increased risk of severe pregnancy complications
including preeclampsia eclampsia HELLP syndrome ICU ad
mission or referral to higher level of care and infections re
quiring antibiotics as well as preterm birth and low birth
weight The risk of maternal mortality was ie times
higher in the group of women with COVID diagnosis These
deaths were concentrated in institutions from less developed
regions implying that when comprehensive ICU services are
not fully available COVID in pregnancy can be lethal Re
assuringly we also found that asymptomatic women with
COVID diagnosis had similar outcomes to women without
COVID diagnosis except for preeclampsia
Importantly women with COVID diagnosis already at
high risk of preeclampsia and COVID because of preexist
ing overweight diabetes hypertension and cardiac and
chronic respiratory diseases had almost times greater risk
of developing preeclampsia eclampsia which could reflect the
known association with these comorbidities and or the acute
kidney damage that can occur in patients with COVID
Our data support reports of an association between
COVID and higher rates of preeclampsia eclampsia
HELLP syndrome but it is still uncertain whether COVID
manifests in pregnancy with a preeclampsialike syndrome or
infection with SARS CoV results in an increased risk for pre
eclampsia Uncertainty persists because the placentas of
women with COVID compared with controls show vascu
lar changes consistent with preeclampsia but the state of
systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability found in non
pregnant patients with severe illness and COVID is also a
feature of preeclampsia
It is known that in nonpregnant patients distinct sub
types may be predictive of clinical outcomes We found the
presence of any COVID symptoms was associated with in
creased morbidity and mortality Specifically severe preg
nancy and neonatal complication rates were highest in women
if fever and shortness of breath were present reflecting sys
temic disease their presence for to days was associated with

b SNMI includes at least of the following morbidities bronchopulmonary
dysplasia hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy sepsis anemia requiring
transfusion patent ductus arteriosus intraventricular hemorrhage
necrotizing enterocolitis or retinopathy of prematurity
c SPMMI includes any of the morbidities listed in the SNMI intrauterine or
neonatal death or NICU stay days
severe maternal and neonatal complications This observa
tion should influence clinical care and referral strategies
The risks of severe neonatal complications including
NICU stay for days or longer as well as the summary index
of severe neonatal morbidity and its individual components
were also substantially higher in the group of women with
COVID diagnosis The increased neonatal risk remained
after adjusting for previous preterm birth and preterm birth
in the index pregnancy thus a direct effect on the newborn
from COVID is likely
Overall our results were consistent across morbidities and
mostly at an RR near or greater than for maternal and neo
natal outcomes with narrow CIs excluding unity and above
to in several estimates Sensitivity and stratified analyses con
firmed the observed results They are probably conservative
because overall of women with COVID diagnosis were
asymptomatic a subgroup with a low risk of complications
Hence higher morbidity and mortality risk should be ex
pected for the general pregnant population especially in low
to middle income countries
We found of neonates born to test positive women
also tested positive a higher figure than in a recent system
atic review We speculate whether contamination at the time
of cesarean delivery was responsible because the rate in this
mother neonate positive subgroup was Reassuringly
as SARS CoV has not been isolated from breast milk breast
feeding was not associated with any increase in the rate oftest
positive neonates
Our results mostly reflect COVID diagnosed in the third
trimester Thus women with COVID diagnosis or whose
pregnancy ended earlier in pregnancy are underrepresented
either because our study was exclusively hospital based or ear
lier infection may manifest with mild symptoms which are
either ignored or managed in primary care Alternatively most
women might have avoided the hospital until late in preg
nancy or when in labor Clearly the effect of COVID early
in pregnancy needs urgently to be studied
Limitations
Our study has expected limitations Ideally we would have
collected data prospectively from all pregnancies in the par
ticipating institutions but this was impractical because of

Instruction
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
ADHD is a chronic condition that affects
millions of children and often continues into
adulthood ADHD includes a combination of
persistent problems such as difficulty
sustaining attention hyperactivity and
impulsive behavior It is characterized by
problems paying attention excessive activity
or difficulty controlling behavior which is not
appropriate for a person s age l These
symptoms begin by age six to twelve are
present for more than six months and cause
problems in at least two settings such as
school home or recreational activities In
children problems paying attention may
result in poor school performance
it causes impairment particularly in modern
society many children with ADHD have a
good attention span for tasks they find
interesting
ADHD is one of the most common
neurobehavioral disorders of childhood
About I in children years of age in
the United States have been diagnosed with
ADHD based on parent reports The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention CDC is
working to understand the risk factors for
ADHD including smoking during pregnancy
so that more can be done to prevent the
disorder

Prenatal maternal smoking has been
associated with ADHD in children in a
number of studies but whether the
association is causal is still under debate In
line with a number of observational studies
smoking during pregnancy is associated with
the diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder HKD
as well as with sub clinical symptoms of
inattention and hyperactivity However these
observational studies are vulnerable to genetic
confounding Many of the studies relied on
retrospective reports of smoking and many
studies had small sample sizes especially for
less common conditions such as TS and
schizophrenia There are also many other
risks that are often present along with
maternal smoking that might explain the link
with neurobehavioral disorders Thus more
research studies are necessary to determine
how prenatal exposure to smoking is related
to developmental outcomes in children
This study aimed to examine the association
between mother smoking during pregnancy
and ADHD in children using case control
study design in national data collected by
CDC
Method
NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey
was used in this study The NHANES
National Youth Fitness Survey NNYFS was
conducted in to collect data on physical
activity and fitness levels in order to provide
an evaluation of the health and fitness of
children in the U S ages to The NNYFS
