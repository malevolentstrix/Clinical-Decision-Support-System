 label use in childbearing or pregnant women of the newly approved
medicine or existing treatment guidelines
Information on pregnancies
Identification of pregnancies start date might be diffcult to identify
Information on drug exposure
Drug exposure identified by prescriptions prescribed dispensed or reimbursed in
secondary sources may not fully represent actual exposure due to nonadherence or
irregular adherence
Not all databases have information on indication duration of prescription
Is all exposure captured For example are in hospital administrations
private prescriptions medicines that are not reimbursed included in the data
Nature of the database
Size of datasets
Whole population data
Representativeness of the national or regional population
Ability to capture all types of pregnancies in the database
The database best suited to the study depends on the purpose of the study
Explain selection of database
Timing of data collection prospectively collected data is free of recall bias
Completeness of data source number extent of geographies covered
Any regional differences may be related to prescribing guidelines or custom and practice
Representativeness of overall studied population e g not only the better educated
nonsmokers and older mothers
Is the medicine being used by childbearing pregnant women
Is the medicine prescribed in primary secondary or tertiary care
When in pregnancy for how long in pregnancy what doses for what indications
time trends
studies needing large samples would be premature mean
while voluntary adverse event reporting databases should
be scrutinized for serious adverse events including congen
ital anomalies
The studies identified addressed conditions generally man
aged in ambulatory care and ten of reported on long term
conditions However many new medicines are introduced in
secondary and tertiary care as this is where most severe condi
tions and sickest patients are treated New medicines are most
frequently developed for the most serious conditions for exam
ple in the UK in of new products launched were
to treat immunological and malignant disorders and for the
next highest categories cardiovascular and infectious diseases
However eight of publications identified had no in
hospital prescribing data and five had only primary care pre
scribing although some of the regimens recorded may be initi
ated by specialists based in secondary or tertiary care Table
DUS on new medicines for immunological and malignant dis
orders were not located despite this being the largest prescrib
ing category Large scale patient data on hospital
prescribing are scarce Many routine healthcare data
bases particularly in Europe do not include in hospital pre
scribing and therefore if the medicine is restricted to hospital
use it is not possible to undertake a DUS For example
most intravenous medicines particularly anticancer treatments
are administered in hospitals and not reliably recorded in pri
mary care Therefore restricting a DUS to ambulatory or pri
mary care without first ascertaining use in secondary care
may generate misleading and invalid conclusions regarding
prevalence of exposure in pregnancy
There was only one study that exclusively studied preg
nant women and only one study that focused on women of
childbearing age The other nine studies evaluated drug utili
zation in the general population for all users of the medicine s
in question as a stratification they estimated the frequency of
pregnant women prescribed the medicine of interest Three of
these studies stated in their protocol that they intended to
assess utilization in pregnancy however when the results were
published no data on pregnancy was presented EMA guide
lines on registry based studies state that feasibility analy
ses may be submitted separately or as part of a proposed
protocol for a registry based study However it is also impor
tant to publish information derived from pregnancies in feasi
bility studies as this can guide the protocols of future studies
The methods used for DUS of older products are very
similar to those identified for new products Most DUS for
new and established medicines focus on estimating the num
ber of pregnant women prescribed the medicine When new
medicines are considered initially few people are exposed
militating against a comprehensive evaluation of some areas
of concern particularly pregnancy and breastfeeding The
objective of a DUS for a new product should be to expedite
facilitate and guide the assessment of safety concerns during
pregnancy Drug safety studies can be planned in parallel or
sequentially using the same databases as the DUS As
observed in several of the studies the protocol of a DUS
can be written before the medicine is on the market When
planned as a phased approach the main objective may be to
determine when there is enough power to perform a safety
Journal of Pregnancy
study Determining sample size ensures that risk estimates
are precise if a study is too small it will yield wide confidence
intervals and imprecise estimates Other DUS objectives
include identification and prevalence of risk factors that may
be confounders such as comedications comorbidities smok
ing age education body weight substance misuse and any
differences between exposed and nonexposed populations
particularly women of childbearing age The DUS will also
generate knowledge of the unique characteristics of the data
sources regarding medicine exposure and can establish the
strengths and limitations of each database so that a range of
databases can be considered to account for known risk factors
For example the Nordic databases hold data on paternity
while Wales holds data on substance misuse When a
DUS is conducted in parallel with a safety study the informa
tion can inform decision points as to phasing and interpreting
the safety study results However complete and accurate data
linkage is essential for safety studies
Limitations and Strengths The biggest limitation of this
systematic review is that very few DUS for new drugs are
being published There were insufficient studies to illustrate
good practice however the available studies offered an over
view of the optimal structure for a DUS in this field
Tables These were considered in association
with existing reporting guidelines A central prob
lem with DUS for new medicines in pregnancy is the
absence of whole population databases for hospital prescrib
ing Prescription and administration data have been cap
tured electronically for many years in most hospitals
however even some well established national healthcare
databases have been unable to link this key data Therefore
pharmacoepidemiologists can only investigate potential
adverse effects of medicines amongst the less ill primary care
population while key signals for harm are missed due to the
fragmentation of data capture for the vulnerable unwell
hospital population New technical financial and gover
nance barriers are not immutable and integrated databases
may well emerge in the future While the majority of preg
nant women are healthy a few experience serious health
problems whose treatment can only be evaluated from hos
pital prescribing data the rarity of serious illness in preg
nancy necessitates combining data from large populations
Comprehensive information is even more important for
safety studies particularly where prescribing is expected to
be low or minimized due to manufacturers warnings
regarding unknown safety in pregnancy or contraindica
tions By accounting for all the items listed above
researchers increase the likelihood that the only remaining
plausible explanation for harm identified is the prescribed
medicine We made no recommendation in relation to
breastfeeding because no studies reported drug utilization
during or preceding breastfeeding very few databases hold
data on breastfeeding
Conclusions
This review of DUS for medicines new to the market illus
trates how DUS might add efficiency to the evaluation of
Journal of Pregnancy
medicines during pregnancy A DUS supports safety studies
by providing
i early confirmation as to whether there are suffcient
exposed pregnancies to provide adequate statistical
power to detect an association with an adverse preg
nancy outcome
ii context and information to evaluate whether addi
tional data from other data sources or more time
are needed
iii information on the most appropriate data sources
to use
iv guidance on the optimal methods for a safety study
such as selection of comparator medicines or
participants
These considerations are particularly relevant where
adverse outcomes are relatively common and with multiple
aetiologies for example small for gestational age or absence of
breastfeeding following antidepressant exposure This does
not detract from the reporting of major congenital anomalies
This paper offers suggestions as to considerations when
planning and reporting DUS for new drugs in pregnant
women Such studies may be planned before marketing
either embedded in a DUS in the general population or in
a retrospective cohort of pregnant women typically for the
first to years after release with annual interim progress
reports These reports may provide patient numbers or sta
tus progress updates to guide safety studies and augment
interpretation of spontaneous pharmacovigilance reports
which start as soon as the drug is marketed The results of
these interim reports final reports should be available in peer
reviewed journals so that researchers and physicians can
access the information easily DUS for new drugs and safety
studies can be planned with a phased or parallel approach to
expedite the knowledge generation regarding the safety of
medicines used during pregnancy and breastfeeding

Abstract
Background Pregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes Even in
uncomplicated pregnancies these changes can affect the quality of life QOL of pregnant women affecting both
maternal and infant health The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated
pregnancy and to assess its associated socio demographic physical and psychological factors in developed
countries
Methods A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines Searches were made in
PubMed EMBASE and BDSP Public Health Database Two independent reviewers extracted the data Countries
with a human development index over were selected The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of
the STROBE criteria
Results In total thirty seven articles were included While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout
pregnancy the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy Main factors
associated with better QOL were mean maternal age primiparity early gestational age the absence of social and
economic problems having family and friends doing physical exercise feeling happiness at being pregnant and
being optimistic Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction complications
before or during pregnancy obesity nausea and vomiting epigastralgia back pain smoking during the months
prior to conception a history of alcohol dependence sleep difficulties stress anxiety depression during pregnancy
and sexual or domestic violence
Conclusions Health related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical
mental and social dimensions of well being Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better
identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible
Keywords Quality of life Pregnancy Primary care Health related quality of life Measurement
Background
According to the World Health Organization quality of
life QOL is defined as individuals perception of their
position in life in the context of the culture and value sys
tems in which they live and in relation to their goals ex
pectations standards and concerns This is a very broad
concept and one that can be influenced in a complex
way by the physical health of the subject his or her psy
chological state and level of independence social

try to satisfy their patients with respect to their experi
ence during preconception and pregnancy periods
Traditionally used pregnancy outcome measures such
as morbidity and mortality rates remain essential How
ever they are not sufficient on their own because popu
lation health should be assessed not only on the basis of
saving lives but also in terms of improving quality of life
Over the past decades numerous instruments have
been developed to measure HRQOL in various patient
populations with basic approaches generic and
disease specific While generic measures for ex
ample the SF Short Form Item and
WHOQOL BREF World Health Organization s Quality
of Life Scale have broad application across different
types and severity of diseases disease specific measures
are designed to assess particular diseases or patient pop
ulations To our knowledge there is no review of the lit
erature to describe the quality of life of pregnant women
in primary care The objectives of this study were to de
scribe the quality of life during uncomplicated preg
nancy and to assess its associated socio demographic
physical and psychological factors in developed
countries
Methods
Type of study
The study consisted of a systematic review of the litera
ture in the PUBMED EMBASE and BDSP databases
BDSP is the French Public Health Database The
search was performed according to the Preferred Report
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses
PRISMA criteria
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The search strategy and inclusion exclusion criteria
were developed by the whole group of authors after
which two authors LN and IG individually con
ducted the literature search Key search terms in
cluded Pregnancy Quality of life or Health
related quality of life Search terms were selected
with reference to relevant index terms MeSH Emtree
or Thesaurus All observational studies e g cohort
cross sectional case control which were published in
English and French prior to March have been
considered no restriction in the starting date Devel
oped countries were chosen as a basis for the re
search to ensure epidemiological uniformity In order
to define a list of developed countries comparable to
France countries with a human development index
HDI of over were selected This list provided by
Page of
the United Nations UN is available online
Studies measuring quality of life with a single ques
tion were excluded Studies on specific popu
lations women with complicated pregnancy or on a
specific scale of quality of life sexual HRQOL or
HRQOL in relation to faecal incontinence etc were
also excluded as it is not possible to compare pa

Article selection and quality assessment
A preliminary selection was made from the titles then
another on reading the summaries and a lastly on a
reading of the entire article Publications related to the
selected articles as well as the bibliography of the se
lected articles were also examined Two independent re
viewers extracted the data LN and IG Disagreement
between reviewers was resolved by consensus The qual
ity of the articles was evaluated using the STROBE cri
teria ST rengthening the Reporting of OBservational
studies in Epidemiology
Analysis
The results were organised in two sections first a descrip
tion of the quality of life of pregnant women in developed
countries and second by the socio demographic physical
and psychological factors associated with their quality of
life When the study compared two quality of life scales
we used only the Gold Standard scale In the

subgroup we have retained the control group that was
most representative of the general population of pregnant
women where all subjects in the study would have re

Factors influencing quality of life
The results of studies on the factors associated with the
quality of life of pregnant women are presented in Ta
bles and Thirty three articles were selected for this
section
Socio demographic factors
The following socio demographic factors were strongly
associated with a better quality of life in studies
mean maternal age primiparity early gestational age
the absence of economic problems a high educational
level being employed being married having family and
friends With less consensus belonging to an ethnic mi
nority and alcohol consumption have also been associ
ated in studies with a poorer quality of life
Physical factors
Medically assisted reproduction obstetric complications
medical history possible hospitalisation and obesity were
factors frequently indicating a poor quality of life during
pregnancy in studies Physical symptoms associated

was a factor that improved the quality of life of pregnant
women With less consensus we found other factors as
sociated with a poorer QOL such as smoking during the
months prior to conception a history of alcohol depend
ence and poor comfort
Psychological factors
Eight studies have shown that symptoms of depression
anxiety and stress were factors that had a strong nega
tive impact on the quality of life of pregnant women
Sexual and domestic violence was linked to a lower
quality of life as well as the experience of
life threatening events and the experience of infertility
Happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic were
factors related to a better quality of life
Discussion
Summary of results
Pregnant women especially during the third trimester
had significantly lower quality of life scores than
non pregnant women of the same age Physically the
quality of life decreased significantly during the course
of the trimesters On a psychological level several stud
ies reported an increase in quality of life relative to men
tal health during pregnancy and in others psychological
stability was seen Many factors were associated with the
quality of life in pregnant women Some factors associ
ated with higher well being were socio demographic
first time pregnancy a favourable socio economic sta
tus social support partner support Similarly the desire
Page of
to be pregnant and moderate physical activity were fac
tors associated with a positive quality of life A lesser
quality of life was attributed to physical factors such as
complications during pregnancy medically assisted
reproduction obesity prior to conception physical
symptoms such as nausea and vomiting sleep difficul
ties and otherwise attributed to psychological factors
such as anxiety and stress during pregnancy and de
pressive symptoms
Strengths and limitations of the study
To our knowledge this is the only systematic review of
international literature aimed at synthesizing data re
garding the quality of life of pregnant women Many fac
tors have been studied considering the different
dimensions of the quality of life for pregnant women in
general good health This work also has its limitations
the research only included articles written in English or
French Therefore the issue of generalizability should be
discussed In addition two other articles could not be
read in their entirety Within the selected studies few
studies were multi centric and only one study used in
formation from a large national survey In addition we
found a high degree of heterogeneity in the methodology
for population selection in choosing the quality of life
scale as well as in the results presented dimensions of
SF composite scores etc complicating the synthesis
study Specific HRQOL questionnaires were not in
cluded because they are focused more on specific prob
lems in pregnancy such as nausea and vomiting rather
than on women s overall well being and their quality of
life With regard to the quality of these studies three
studies did not explicitly take into account the con
founding factors in the presentation of the results
which may lead to confusion bias In addition a
large number of studies were cross sectional These
studies did not establish an associative cause and effect
relationship
Research and policy implications
In some countries the quality of life of pregnant woman
has been little studied In France for example only one
study provided information on pregnant women
well being study not included in our analysis cf
exclusion criteria In this study the mental health of
pregnant women was measured through the following
question On a psychological level how did you feel
during your pregnancy Well Quite well Quite poor
Poor Of the women interviewed reported
poor self rated mental health during pregnancy More
over sociodemographic characteristics indicative of so
Cial disadvantage were associated with a higher risk of
poor quality of life sometimes a social gradient was ob
served Since SF is a generic scale it allows
