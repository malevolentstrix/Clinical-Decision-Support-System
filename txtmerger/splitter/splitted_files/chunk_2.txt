Abstract This study is aimed at providing companies with de
cision support in selecting the most suitable production processes
for producing diverse customized products belonging to a family
in attempting to achieve production efficiency while utilizing the
available manufacturing resources One of the measurements of
best suitability is the similarity of production processes for
producing product family members If the production processes
are similar there will be fewer production changeovers This in
turn helps achieve not only efficiency but also product quality
We develop an integer linear formulation for the selection of
production routings for each member of a product family and
for the assignment of an execution mode to each operation in
each selected routing We report on computational experiments
with an illustrative example instance

I INTRODUCTION
The objective of this paper is to formulate a mathematical
model that determines an optimal production process for a
customized product belonging to a family i e process family
planning In this regard both representation as well as
selection of alternative production processes are required The
output includes specific operations or operations modes and
their precedence relationships i e operations precedence the
total processing time and the total production cost
In practice for producing a product a routing consists of
a number of operations and operations precedence It can
be implemented by a number of production process alter
natives each of which is formed by operations modes and
the corresponding operations precedence Companies typically
adopt only one production process to produce each product
in the hope of reducing the difficulties and complexities
in production on the shop floors l Different modes
of a same operation may differ in manufacturing resources
such as machines tools fixtures thus leading to different
processing times and costs In process family planning all the
production process alternatives for a given customized product
are compared with the production process being used on the
shop floor for producing other customized products belonging
to the same family In accordance with the differences in
routings and manufacturing resources production processes
are compared with respect to the routing and manufactur
ing resource similarities That is the total similarity of two
production processes includes the weighted routing similarity
and manufacturing resource similarity The higher the total
similarity between a production process alternative and the
existing one the fewer production changeovers will be needed
which in turn contributes to production stability reduced
production cost and product quality
The total production cost is the total cost for producing
the given customized product using the selected production
process Since the cost for each operations mode is known
the total production cost is the sum of the costs of operations
modes which form the selected production process The total
processing time is obtained as the maximum length duration
of any sequence of operations that cannot be processed in
parallel According to the above the objective has three
parts to maximize production similarity to minimize total
production cost and to minimize total processing time
II OPTIMIZATION

We consider the following definitions

i th alternative routing for product p G P a
partially ordered set Qpi Api with Qpi C Q and
binary relation Api C Qpi x Qpi transitive and
irreflexive and
the set of all alternative routings RPi for product p
Each operations precedence set Api is such that WI G A
if and only if the output of WI belongs to the input set of
In this paper we work with hierarchical BOM structures
where each operation only has one output as opposed to flat
or inverse BOMs which may have more than one identical
or distinct outputs Each routing has one unique end product
which is the unique output component p G P of the unique
maximal element of Q A O Consequently each graph
G Qpi Api is an in tree We also assume that each operation
appears at most once in each routing
The routing similarity for two routings RPi Rqj for two
different products p q is defined as follows

We also consider a set of modes M w for each w G Q
Each mode m G M w has an associated cost cw
and an
associated duration dam For a given operations set Qpi C Q a
process alternative is a mapping of each operation w G
to a mode w G M w Each mode corresponds to a
selection of a set of manufacturing resources to perform the
operation in question The manufacturing resource similarity

identical operations in the two production processes More

B Problem statement and a linear model
Our goal is to select a set of production processes each
of which is formed by specific operations modes and their
operations precedence to produce a given set of products
such that an optimal performance with respect to production
similarity total production cost and total processing time can
be achieved These three objectives similarity cost and time
may conflict with one another Thus we include a composite
similarity measure in the objective and relegate cost and time
to the constraints where we impose an upper bound Cp and
Tp on the total cost respectively time for product p
The problem to be solved can be captured by a linear model
with the following two sets of decision variables
xpz G xpz
iff routing Rpt is chosen for
product p and
iff operation w for product p is
executed in mode m so if arp w m
We also use the following additional parameters in the model
Q p C Q is the subset of operations that occur in at least
one routing for product p
iff operation w appears in
routing i for product p
iff operation w can be per
pzwm
pawm
formed in mode m in routing i for product p and
L p i C is the set of operation sets that corre
spond with an inclusion maximal path in graph
Consequently
iff there is at least one mode m such
that
pawm
The following constraint applies
iGRp
where i G Rp stands for Rpt G Rp This constraint implies
that exactly one routing will be chosen for each product
If a routing Rpt is selected x pi such that Ypwm cannot
equal namely if
we need to enforce value upon
pzwm
the corresponding Y variable

We also impose that exactly one mode be chosen for each
operation in the routing selected for product p as follows

This constraint also ensures that no mode is selected if w does
not appear in the selected routing
The upper limits on the total cost and total duration for each
product can be imposed with the following constraints

In this expression the term RS Rpz Rqj is independent of X

are multipliers that can be tuned to balance the importance
of the routing and the manufacturing similarity respectively
In this paper for illustrative simplicity these weights are
set as each In practice companies can decide on the
values of these two weights based on their own production
characteristics
C Complexity analysis
Consider the following decision problem
EVEN ODD PARTITION
Instance A finite set A
and a size
s a G N for each a G A
Question Is there a subset N C A such that s a
s a and A contains exactly one of ly I am for
aGA A
This problem is known to be NP complete It can be shown
that the feasibility question for the optimization problem
defined in Section II B is also NP complete For a given
instance of EVEN ODD PARTITION consider a single prod
uct p with only one routing IRpl such that n
and Qpl Apl is a complete order on QPI the precedence
graph is one chain of n operations Each operation Wi
i n has exactly two modes M w
and consider the following
Define Smax
maxi I
costs and durations for each operation under each mode
s Lil S
s Let B
and
Li l It can
Smax
be verified that a feasible mode assignment for the thus
constructed instance exists with C B and Tp
if and only if the answer to the corresponding PARTITION
instance is yes
This complexity result implies that a polynomial time algo
rithm for solving the problem does not exist unless P NP
which is generally assumed to be very unlikely We therefore
solve the integer linear formulation developed supra by means
of a mainstream linear solver
III NUMERICAL EXAMPLE AND DISCUSSION
We consider a numerical example where a product family
consists of three product variants P The
maximal allowable cost and time for producing each product
variant are as follows Cl Tl
and Each product variant has two routing
alternatives the routing sets for each product variant are de
noted by Rp RPI for p The routing graphs
G Qpi Api are included in Appendix A The set of operations
for producing the product family includes operations in
total some of which are the same Most operations can be
implemented by different sets of manufacturing resources
leading to specific operations modes and the corresponding
durations and costs Some modes for identical operations for
different products are also the same Further details are given
in the appendix
The linear formulation contains variables all binary
in total for the example instance and constraints It was
solved by Gurobi Solver called from Python
The experiment was run on a Dell OptiPlex with an
Intel Core processor and GB of RAM running
Ubuntu LTS The instance was solved in less than
seconds this indicates that the runtime for any instance
of comparable size will be negligible The optimal production
similarity equals With the current values for Cp and
Tp none of the budget and time constraints and is
binding so the optimal objective value would equal
even if constraints were simply removed
Figure examines the optimal production similarity for the
example instance as a function of the upper bounds on cost
and time In detail the right hand sides of the constraints
for all three products in Equation respectively are
simultaneously decreased by the value on the horizontal axis
in the plot in Figure respectively Figure We observe
that the optimal production similarity remains constant until
one of the constraints becomes binding after which there is
a steady decrease until the constraints become too restrictive
to admit a feasible solution which is where the plots end
The plot for the durations displays a similar pattern This
implies that restrictive budgets and limits on processing times

therefore we intend to extend the model by taking into account
this situation From a more theoretical point of view we have
only shown NP hardness in the ordinary sense although we
suspect that the problem can also be shown to be strongly
NP hard In this regard showing either strong NP hardness or
developing a pseudo polynomial time algorithm is a subject
for future work as well Finally due to the complexity status
of the problem when the instances to be solved are of larger
size then it may be necessary to resort to heuristic procedures

I V CONCLUSION
This paper has introduced an optimization model to as
sist companies in planning production processes for diverse
customized products such that production efficiency can be
achieved by maintaining production as stable as possible
We have considered not only routing and manufacturing
resource similarities but also production time and cost The
optimization problem at hand turns out to be NP hard and
we have therefore employed a commercial solver to solve a
linear formulation of the problem We have reported our results
for a numerical example which demonstrates that our model
can provide decision making support in planning production
processes for product families
The optimization model has been developed by considering
the situation where all customized products belonging to a
family are launched at the same time In practice companies

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective This short communication demonstrates how short tandem repeat genotyping can identify
the origin of gestational choriocarcinoma
Materials and methods The origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in our three cases was determined
using the short tandem repeats genotyping technique which involved quantitative fluorescent PCR and
fragmentation analysis
Results In Case despite no medical history of molar pregnancy DNA analysis indicated that the
choriocarcinoma originated from a homozygous complete hydatidiform mole We conclude that the
patient s complete abortion years prior to the choriocarcinoma diagnosis was an undiagnosed com
plete hydatidiform mole In Case and Case the clinically presumed origin of choriocarcinoma was
confirmed
Conclusion Determining the origin of choriocarcinoma is essential for clinical application as it affects
the FIGO scoring system for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia which determines the patient s prog
nosis and treatment approach

choriocarcinoma is currently low because of its high chemo
sensitivity
Materials and methods
The origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in our three cases was
determined using the Short Tandem Repeats STR genotyping
technique which involved Quantitative Fluorescent PCR QF PCR
and fragmentation analysis Blood saliva and tissues from paraffin
blocks were used for DNA isolation with QIAGEN kits QF PCR was
performed using the GenePrint System Promega and Devyser
Extend Devyser commercial kits Capillary electrophoresis was
performed on ABI Prism and ABI Prism Genetic
Analyzer The recommended DNA concentration in reaction of
samples isolated from formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue
were adjusted increased because of poor quality of DNA and
fragmentation The GeneMapperTM Software was used to
analyze the data
To interpret the obtained data two main tasks need to be per
formed First the genome composition needs to be determined by
Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics Gynecology
comparing the STR allelic profiles of the choriocarcinoma and the
patient which allows the identification of the type of pregnancy
that gave rise to the cancer Abnormal genome compositions are
characteristic of molar pregnancies with complete hydatidiform
moles typically having two sets of paternal chromosomes Fig la
and c and partial hydatidiform moles having two sets of paternal
and one set of maternal chromosomes However biparental com
plete hydatidiform mole can have a physiological genome compo
sition which is a potential pitfall Non gestational choriocarcinoma
lacks identifiable paternal allelic sets Table
Matching the choriocarcinoma with a specific pregnancy based
on genetic analysis is important for determining both the type of
pregnancy that gave rise to the tumor and the time interval be
tween the end of the index pregnancy and treatment as illustrated

Discussion
STR genotyping can provide clinically significant information for
gestational choriocarcinoma cases
Genetic analysis revealed misdiagnosed complete hydatidiform
mole in Case The patient got point less in the FIGO scoring
system Supplemental Table what did not change the stratification
of the patient in this particular case she stayed in the high risk
group
In Case the gestational choriocarcinoma originated from a
term birth and genetic analysis was crucial in excluding any un
recognized pregnancies In Case a metastatic gestational
choriocarcinoma developed just two weeks after the evacuation
because of the malignant transformation of a dispermic complete
hydatidiform mole highlighting the highly aggressive nature of
these lesions
According to a study recently published by Jung et al copy
neutral loss of heterozygosity CN LOH and copy number al
terations CNAs are key molecular characteristics in gestational
choriocarcinomas arising from complete hydatidiform moles
CN LOH occurs in homozygous monospermic complete hyda
tidiform moles on a whole genome level because of the dupli
cation of a haploid set of chromosomes in one sperm like in our
Case The CN LOH pattern seen in heterozygous dispermic
complete hydatidiform moles is typically segmental what is
attributable to two independent meiotic events of the two
sperms fertilizing the ovum like in our Case According to the
above mentioned study malignant transformation of complete
moles into choriocarcinoma may happen by the accumulation of
CNAs
Using STR genotyping is possible to differentiate between
monospermic homozygous and dispermic heterozygous com
plete moles Finding out whether the complete mole is heterozy
gous or homozygous in clinical practice only points to a higher risk
of malignancy in the case of a heterozygous complete mole but
does not predict malignancy The close follow up of the hCG tumor
marker and the patient s clinical condition remains crucial
According to the FIGO scoring system the source of choriocar
cinoma is the antecedent last pregnancy DNA analysis can reveal
that this was not the case and that the choriocarcinoma did not
come from the last pregnancy but from the previous one This can
change the scoring system the number of points not only for the
pregnancy preceding choriocarcinoma but also for the interval from
the antecedent pregnancy Ultimately this can change the patient
stratification from low risk to high risk or vice versa which also
changes the chemotherapeutic approach monochemotherapy
polychemotherapy
In summary STR genotyping is an efficient and accurate method
for identifying the origin of both gestational and non gestational
choriocarcinoma Fresh frozen tissue is the preferred sample type
but formalin fixed paraffin embedded samples are also acceptable
The genotypes of the patient tumor and previous pregnancies are
compared to determine the type and time interval from the end of
the index pregnancy both of which are important for prognosis and
treatment It s worth noting that the last pregnancy may not always
be the source of gestational choriocarcinoma and occult non
diagnosed molar nonmolar pregnancies can also contribute to
this malignancy According to our experiences the described
molecular diagnostic method is economically manageable costs
L Gergely V Repiska R Petrovic et al
approximately as other standard laboratory diagnostic methods in
Slovakia In clinical practice identifying the origin of choriocarci
noma can change the FIGO score and optimize the chemotherapy
regimen

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objectives Family planning is a cornerstone to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals How
ever men s involvement in family planning has been a challenge in many countries This study aimed to
investigate the participation of men in the family planning programs and related factors from the per
spective of women referring to family planning organizations in Herat Afghanistan
Methods The study had a cross sectional design The participants of the study consisted of married
women aged years selected by simple random sampling The data collection tool was a valid and
reliable questionnaire to assess the participation of men in family planning programs To analyze the data
descriptive statistics and analytical methods including Mann Whitney and Pearson Chi Square tests were
applied in SPSS The answers to the open end questions were analyzed coded and classified in two
main categories
Results The average age of study participants was years and a significant proportion of them
were illiterate Most of the participants were housewives and their husbands were non
professional workers The husbands participated in family planning programs by choosing the
type of contraception provision of contraceptives and supporting their wives using them
There were statistically significant relationships between women s and their husband s education
level and husband s employment status with the type of participation in family planning The main in
centives for Afghan men to participate family planning were the increased attention of families to the
education and needs of children and the health and welfare of the wives However cultural norms sup
porting larger families the desire for having boy children the fear of contraception s side effects and
religious prohibitions discourage them in using family planning methods
Conclusion A large number of the respondents stated that their spouse participated in family planning
programs It shows the importance and success of family planning centers in promoting sexual and re
productive health and family planning Study showed that various factors affected men s participation in
family planning programs Recognition of these factors can help policy makers in designing behavioral
interventions based on social marketing and enhancing the effectiveness of these programs
One of the most important areas of population policies is hu
man reproduction Family planning has been a part of most socio
economic development plans around the world in recent years
Keshavarz et al It has been used by policy makers in mak

The International Conference on Population and Development
Cairo addressed this important issue According to this con
ference sexual and reproductive health programs should have a
couple oriented approach and not only focus on women but also
persuade men to fulfill their responsibilities Men by having im

in the promotion of women and children s health Simbar et al
In this conference the concept of men s participation was
defined as supporting the wife in receiving pregnancy care fam
ily planning and preserving sexual and reproductive health In fact
the participation of men means fulfilling their responsibilities in
supporting the spouse to deal with the diffculties of sexual life
childbearing and choosing and using contraception methods WHO
So far most family planning activities and studies have fo

Afghanistan is located within South and Central Asia With per
capita GDP of this country is ranked as a low income
country World Bank Annual population growth rate of
Afghanistan was in Wold Bank The effective
and successful implementation of family planning programs can
play an important role in the country s sustainable development
Starbird et al and as mentioned this will not happen with
out the participation of men and women Studying men s partici
pation and related factors is essential for planning and implement
ing interventions to improve the level and quality of participation
Considering the cultural context of Afghanistan and the predomi
nance of men s decisions in the family and the fact that according
to the Afghanistan s law polygamy is allowed Monsutti It
is especially important to involve them in the use of contraceptive
methods According to Shafiqollah et al the awareness of Afghans
about contraceptive methods is satisfactory but the contraceptive
prevalence is low Shafiqullah et al There is a knowledge
gap about men s participation in family planning programs in this
country The purpose of this study was to investigate the partici
pation of men in family planning programs from the perspective of
women in Afghanistan
Methods
This study has a cross sectional design The study population
included married women aged years who referred to the
clinics of Marie Stopes Institute in Herat city of Afghanistan in
Herat is the capital city of Herat province located in the west
of Afghanistan With a population of people in this
city was the fourth populated city in Afghanistan World Popula
tion Review Marie Stopes is a foreign NGO providing fam
ily planning and contraceptive services in Afghanistan It has two
clinics in Herat The population of the city has acceptable access to
these two clinics
Zwi et al
Based on the following formula due to the lack of similar stud
ies regarding the participation rate of men in the family planning
program in Afghanistan the participation rate p of has been
taken into account which by considering the first type error a of
the power of the test as and the accuracy d as
the sample size was estimated to be
Midwifery
Considering that the number of referrals to two clinics of Marie
Stopes Institute was almost equal the sample was se
lected equally from each clinic Sampling was done in four differ
ent weeks in four different months It was performed in all days
of each week and in three different times per day including early
working hours of the clinics samples mid hours samples
and the end of working hours samples Each time samples
were selected randomly according to the order of their arrival at
the clinic
To collect data a questionnaire which had been made and used
in a similar study by Pouransary et al was used Pouransary et al
The mentioned study aimed to determine the use of differ
ent methods of contraception among women of Iranshahr a dis
trict in southeast of Iran near the border of Iran Afghanistan and
the rate of their husbands participation in family planning The
validity of the questionnaire was confirmed according to the opin
ions of experts by calculating the content validity ratio CVR
The reliability of the questionnaire was examined by the test retest
method in a pilot study on samples with a week interval be
tween the two tests According to the calculated intraclass corre
lation coeffcient ICC of the reliability of the questionnaire
was confirmed Pouransary et al Because the offcial lan
guage of both countries Iran and Afghanistan was the same there
was no need for translating the questionnaire and only terminol
ogy edit was done by a person who was familiar with two dialects
of Persian Farsi and Dari However in order to ensure the con
tent validity of the questionnaire in the context of Afghanistan the
questionnaire was assessed and approved by a number of Afghan
experts in reproductive health and family planning programs
The questionnaire consisted of three parts In the first part de
mographic characteristics of the women participating in the study
and their spouses were asked The second part consisted of two
questions In the first question each participant was asked about
the status of her spouse s participation in family planning in the
form of a four choice question Lack of any cooperation Se
lection and cooperation in choosing the method of contraception
Preparation of contraceptives Supporting and reminding the
correct and effective use of the method In this case the respon
dents could choose more than one answer In the second question
the participants were asked to indicate their satisfaction with the
contraception method in a four choice Likert scale very satisfied
relatively satisfied neither agree nor disagree relatively
dissatisfied and dissatisfied The third part of the ques
tionnaire was about what encourages and discourages Afghan men
to participate in family planning
To analyze the data descriptive statistical methods including
percentage and mean as well as analytical methods including
Mann Whitney and Pearson Chi square tests were used Data anal
ysis was performed using SPSS software version Moreover the
answers to open end questions were analyzed coded and classified
in two main categories
