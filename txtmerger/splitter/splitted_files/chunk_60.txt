can limit patients ability to make fully voluntary choices

Borkowski Couillard Allina Wood Vaaler et al
For example clinicians may withhold information
about options available and or pressure patients to make
certain decisions either implicitly or explicitly Previous
research has also found that physician specialty age and
gender as well as county characteristics were associated with
contraceptive service provision to Medicaid beneficiaries
Bodas et al This research on clinician influence in
provision of family planning services aligns with other
research highlighting physician driven effects in health care
such as physician driven rates of cesarean sections Burns
Geller Wholey and medical device use Bergman
Grennan Swanson
Previous research has also examined how facility charac
teristics impact family planning service provision For
example studies have found that the types of services pro
vided differ based on clinic ownership and geography
Bornstein Carter Zapata Gavin Moskosky Frost

Previous research has found that almost all federally
qualified health centers FQHCs offer some type of family
planning services but there is wide variation in the type s of
services offered Wood et al Wood et al orga
nization and delivery of care Goldberg et al
and
availability of care to underserved and adolescent populations
Goldberg et al Mead et al However no studies
to our knowledge have simultaneously analyzed the associa
tion between facility and clinician characteristics and family
planning service provision while also stratifying by service
type
The objective of this study was two fold First we provided
descriptive statistics regarding the provision of family planning
services in outpatient care settings such as CHCs and private
physician practices excluding Planned Parenthood and Title X
clinics We aimed to better understand family planning services
that occur outside of family planning specialty settings because
primary care practices often face multiple challenges meeting
patients family planning needs amidst their many other con
cerns Biggs Kaller Harper Freedman Mays Second we
analyzed whether family planning service provision differed
based on facility and clinician characteristics using multilevel
modeling techniques to estimate the variation between indi
vidual clinicians In doing so we hope to provide valuable con
tributions to the literature on where and by whom family
planning services are provided in outpatient care settings This
knowledge will inform the larger discussion on the most effec
tive and equitable strategies to improve access to family plan
ning services In addition better understanding the role of
clinicians in family planning service provision can help to better
target resources and training so that patient needs and prefer
ences are met
Methods
Data
We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey NAMCS an annual national probability sample survey of
clinicians who are involved directly in office based ambulatory
i e outpatient care Observations were at the visit level and
sampled visits include those with physicians PAs nurse practi
tioners and nurse midwives Visits at Planned Parenthood Title
X clinics and hospital outpatient departments were not included
in the dataset NAMCS uses a standard clinician interview form
and automated tool to extract data from the patient record
which helps to minimize survey recall bias and missing infor
mation The annual survey is conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics of the CDC Methods used in the design
conduct and analysis of these surveys are fully described on the
NAMCS website where the data are also available National
Center for Health Statistics
We limited our sample to reproductive age years
individuals office visits between January and December
excluding because data were not collected and
made available that year Because of the COVID pandemic
is the most recent year where data were publicly available
NAMCS survey methodology includes a binary sex indicator all
visits in our sample were with patients who identified as female
at the time of data collection Our study sample ranges from
approximately to patient visits per year depending
on the year Given the deidentified nature of this public use
dataset analyses using NAMCS data are exempt from institu
tional review board approval

Analysis Variables
Our dependent variable was whether family planning ser
vices were provided at the visit We initially estimated models
based on whether any type of family planning service was pro
vided and then estimated models based on the specific type of
service provided For the purposes of our study we dis
aggregated family planning services into six categories contra
ceptive counseling contraceptive pill or shot IUD hormonal
implant sterilization and abortion These categories were
informed by NAMCS survey methodology and previous literature
Bello et al National Center for Health Statistics
Sarayani et al We used International Classification of
Diseases edition diagnosis and procedure codes medica
tions and reason for visit documented in the patient s record to
indicate if and what type of family planning service was pro
vided during the visit More than one type of family planning
service was provided in approximately of our sampled visits
e g contraceptive counseling and pill provided at the same
visit
Independent variables were facility location facility type
ownership type s of clinicians seen during the visit physi
cian specialty and whether the patient saw their primary care
provider PCP during the visit Facility location is urban if in a
Metropolitan Statistical Area and rural otherwise Types of
outpatient facilities in the sample include those owned by
private physician practices CHCs medical academic health
centers and insurance companies health plans or health
maintenance organizations NAMCS categorizes the following
types of facilities as CHCs FQHCs defined through the
Public Health Service Act that receive Section funding
FQHC look alikes or community based health care providers
that meet the requirements of the HRSA Health Center Pro
gram but do not receive Health Center Program funding and
urban Indian Health Service outpatient clinics We included
a categorical measure of team based care specifically types of
clinicians seen during the visit only a physician only a
PA or nurse physician and PA physician and nurse
physician and other clinician type nurse and other clinician
type and only other clinician type Nurses include nurse
practitioners registered nurses and licensed practical nurses
Other clinician types include mental health providers phar
macists and other allied health professionals If a physician
was seen during the visit categories of physician specialties
include general family practice obstetrics and gynecology
internal medicine pediatrics psychiatry and other specialty
e g cardiovascular health neurology Last we included a
binary variable indicating whether the patient saw their PCP
at the visit
The analyses control for patient characteristics associated
with use of family planning services including patient age in
surance type private Medicaid Medicare self pay no charge
charity care and other payment race ethnicity non Hispanic
White non Hispanic Black Hispanic and non Hispanic other
multiracial chronic disease substance use disorder and body
mass index Patient age was defined as a categorial variable to
to to or to years old We controlled for
chronic diseases that previous research has found could influ
ence use of family planning services specifically asthma chronic
heart failure hypertension diabetes obesity and depression
Chor Rankin Harwood Handler Phillips Bell
Sappenfield Robbins Hernandez We also include
state and year fixed effects
Statistical Analyses
For basic characterization of both outcome and predictor
variables we conducted descriptive statistical analyses for our
total sample of visits and visits where family planning services
were provided stratifying by specific type of service provided
Next we used multilevel random intercept logistic regression to
estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the relationship between
facility and clinician characteristics and provision of family
planning services Our models included clinician level random
intercepts e g clustered by specific clinician identifier and
therefore allow for nonindependence of the outcomes for
different patients treated by the same clinician given the cova
riates In addition random intercept models allowed us to
differentiate the residual variation in the outcome explained by
clinician level factors Specifically the random intercept residual
variance allowed us to quantify the impact of clinician level
factors not measured by covariates on family planning service
provision Maximum likelihood estimation with adaptive quad
rature was used to estimate the model parameters We also used
robust standard errors clustered at the clinician level using a
Huber White sandwich estimator
Across our models we reported measures of clinician level
heterogeneity controlling for covariates namely the residual
standard deviation intraclass correlation ICC and median odds
ratio MOR Residual standard deviation is a measure of the
variability at the clinician level Rabe Hesketh Skrondal
The ICC measures between clinician heterogeneity or within
clinician homogeneity and is interpreted in terms of the latent
response for logistic regression models Hedeker
Previ
ous studies have also used ICC as an indicator of reliability with a
higher ICC indicating higher reliability of estimates Rodriguez
et al
The MOR is a measure of heterogeneity between
clinicians after controlling for other covariates It is the median
value of the odds ratios when comparing the odds of family
planning service provision for a patient from one randomly
selected clinician cluster with another patient that has identical
covariates but is randomly selected from a different clinician
cluster The MOR can be conceptualized as the increased likeli
hood of family planning provision in median from seeing a
different randomly selected clinician who was otherwise iden
tical in terms of observed covariates Merlo et al
All hypothesis tests reported are based on two sided p values
We considered p values of less than to be statistically sig
nificant Data management and analysis were conducted using

Our measures of between clinician heterogeneity indicate a
high amount of variation in which clinicians provided family
planning services The ICC was meaning that of the
variation in our outcome family planning service provision for
the latent response was due to clinician level factors not
captured by the observed covariates in our model For compar
ison a systematic review analyzing between clinician variation
for different health care outcomes estimated an ICC of to
for clinician activity use i e ordering prescriptions laboratory
tests to for diabetes care and outcomes and up to
for patient satisfaction with PCPs Fung et al Researchers
have also theorized that a high ICC meaning high variability
between individual clinicians indicates high potential for qual
ity improvement at the clinician level Berwick The esti
mated MOR was meaning if two clinicians in our dataset
identical in terms of observed covariates were randomly
selected one would have a times higher median odds of
providing family planning services compared with the other
Overall these measures of between clinician heterogeneity
indicate that specific clinicians were much more likely to provide
family planning care compared with others after controlling for
observed covariates

Sensitivity Analyses
In our first sensitivity analysis we estimated the measures of
between clinician heterogeneity for specific types of family
planning services see bottom of Table The ICC ranges from
for IUD visits to for counseling visits and the MOR
follows a similar pattern We also estimated the ICC for common
facility ownership types and found the ICC was for private
physician practices and for CHCs Overall measures of be
tween clinician heterogeneity were relatively consistent even
when stratifying by type of family planning service and facility
type This further supports the hypothesis that certain clinicians
were much more likely to provide family planning services
compared with others
In our second sensitivity analysis we estimated random
intercept regression models during specific years Although the
survey is designed to be nationally representative every year the
NAMCS has used slightly different survey and sampling designs
over to so we wanted to ensure the robustness of our
regression results across years In Appendix Table A l we present
adjusted odds ratios for any type of family planning service being
provided These estimates indicate that our results are qualita
tively similar over the study period Owing to changes in sam
pling design and weighting schema we are not able to estimate
how the overall prevalence of family planning service provision
has changed in our sample between the years and

Discussion
This study analyzed the association between facility and
clinician characteristics and family planning services provided
during outpatient care visits in the United States We aimed to
better understand family planning services that occur in primary
care outpatient settings such as CHCs and private physician
practices rather than family planning specialty settings e g
Planned Parenthood and Title X clinics By clustering our results
at the clinician level we were able to quantify the variation be
tween specific clinicians in the odds of family planning service
provision To our knowledge this study is the first to empirically
investigate the role of facility and clinician characteristics on the
likelihood of family planning service provision using a large
nationally representative dataset and multilevel modeling
techniques The use of a large national dataset makes our find
ings broadly generalizable to the outpatient care setting
We find that any type of family planning service was provided
at of the total sampled visits Contraceptive counseling was
provided most commonly other family planning services were
not provided very often We also find that family planning ser
vices were more likely to be provided in urban areas at CHCs
and when patients received team based care Our results indi
cate that some clinicians were much more likely than others to
provide family planning services after controlling for observed
covariates which is consistent with other literature highlighting
clinician influence on health care use Flynn Smith Davis
Fred Fung et al This finding suggests that
diverse clinician beliefs and practices may influence what and if
family planning services are provided to patients

This study has several limitations Our data source NAMCS
does not include several variables such as patient sexual ac
tivity sexual orientation pregnancy desires or physician age
gender and race ethnicity that may influence our observed
outcomes Another limitation is that we were unable to ascertain
patient preferences or disentangle selection effects regarding
family planning service provision We would expect some vari
ation between clinicians owing to factors such as patient selec
tion and clinician experience and training However the
measures of between clinician heterogeneity in our study are
high relative to measures of between clinician heterogeneity for
other health care processes and outcomes in the literature Fung
et al
Future research should further explore these se
lection effects to better understand the causal impact of facility
and clinician characteristics on family planning service
provision
Implications for Policy and or Practice
Ensuring access to comprehensive patient centered family
planning services is a key strategy in advancing reproductive
autonomy Our results suggest that more work may be needed to
ensure clinicians are willing and able to provide family planning
care as recommended by the CDC and several professional
medical societies Studies have found that training and support
for patient centered counseling may be an effective approach to
increase access to comprehensive family planning services and
support reproductive agency Dehlendorf Grumbach
Schmittdiel Steinauer Harper et al Stulberg
Broader facility level system changes may also be
et al
needed to address barriers so that PCPs are able to incorporate
family planning services when appropriate and desired by pa
tients These changes may include expanded referral networks
modifications in team based care processes such as nonphysi
cian clinicians providing family planning services in some cases
billing and payment incentives and or patient engagement and
education tools In addition policy changes related to over the
counter contraception telehealth regulation and scope of prac
tice laws may decrease barriers to access
Conclusions
Our findings inform the broader discussion on the most
effective and equitable strategies to improve access to family
planning services Understanding the role of facility and clinician
characteristics in service provision can help to better target re
sources and training so that patient needs and desires are met
Given that primary care is the principal source of health care for
many pregnancy capable people increasing the proportion of
clinicians who offer patient centered contraceptive counseling
in primary care settings is key to improving access and outcomes
On June the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs
v Jackson Women s Health Organization no longer acknowledging
the constitutional right to an abortion
National Constitution
Abortion access has been further restricted in
Center
the wake of this ruling highlighting a need to integrate family
planning services in particular contraceptive counseling to
ensure patient reproductive needs and desires are met Future
work should focus on understanding barriers and developing
interventions to incorporate recommended family planning
services into primary care and other appropriate outpatient
settings

immediate neonatal outcomes were assessed A total of pregnant women with a positive test
for SARS CoV were included among which presented with severe COVID disease
Risk factors for severe maternal outcomes were pulmonary comorbidities aOR Cl
hypertensive disorders aOR Cl and diabetes Cl Pregnant
women with severe maternal outcomes were at higher risk of caesarean section n
preterm delivery n and newborns requiring admission to the neonatal intensive
care unit n In this study several risk factors for developing severe complications of
SARS CoV infection among pregnant women were identified including pulmonary comorbidities
hypertensive disorders and diabetes Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes appear to be influenced by
the severity of maternal disease
Altered immunity reduced respiratory capacity vascular and hemodynamic changes put pregnant women at
higher risk of complications while specific harm to the exposed fetus newborn may be observed Although
early reports from the SARS CoV epidemicl suggested that the clinical course for infected pregnant women
was similar to the general population more recent data suggest a higher risk of severe outcomes in pregnant
women compared to the general population at an equivalent age with severe outcomes observed in to
In the general population preexisting health conditions namely pulmonary pathologies hypertension and
diabetes have been associated with severe Information on the impact of these determinants on the
maternal disease evolution and other risk factors specific to pregnancy is still fragmented although evidence
suggest that they might contribute to the severity of the Furthermore fetal newborn risks still need
to be better assessed as vertical transmission of the virus and placental infection appears to be possible with
newborns potentially demonstrating related symptoms
while a significantly higher rate of preterm deliveries
among women with Coronavirus disease COVID has been
Information on specific risks among pregnant women are urgently needed to provide evidence based guide
lines for the management of this vulnerable population To accomplish this we developed an international web
in March to promote a structured collection of data regarding pregnant women and their fetuses
exposed to SARS CoV Using this dataset we performed a case control study to assess the risk of severe mater
nal outcomes and associated risk factors as well as a description of pregnancy neonatal outcomes stratified for
the severity of the disease among pregnant women with a confirmed SARS CoV infection
Materials and methods
Study setting and population The patients enrolled in this study are part of the COVI Preg international
registry investigating the consequences of SARS Cov infection during All pregnant women tested
for SARS CoV infection at any stage of gestation were eligible for inclusion in this multicenter study except
those years of age as well as individuals declining to consent or not able to consent for themselves Informed
oral or written consent was obtained for all participants Deidentified data were prospectively recorded by each
center Table Sl using the REDCap Research Electronic Data Capture electronic data capture uality
checks were performed as described in the Supplementary Materials Using this dataset we performed a case
control study among pregnant women with a confirmed SARS CoV infection
The study was approved by both the Swiss Ethical Board CER VD and the local ethics boards
at each participating center The study was conducted from March to July All methods were
carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations in the manuscript
Inclusion criteria and SARS CoV status Pregnant women were tested for SARS CoV either
because of a suspected infection due to ongoing symptoms compatible with COVID or an history of potential
exposure or through routine systematic screening instituted during the pandemic in some hospitals depending
on local capacities and guidelines Maternal testing was performed using a nasopharyngeal RT PCR for SARS
COV swab test Pregnant women with a positive RT PCR test result at any stage during pregnancy irrespective
of clinical signs and symptoms were considered as having a confirmed infection and included in the present
study Pregnant women with a SARS CoV negative test and no other positive test result during the entire
follow up period were excluded
Case and control definition Pregnant women with severe adverse outcomes defined as any of the follow
ing the need for advanced oxygen support i e high flow cannula non invasive ventilation through CPAP
or mechanical ventilation admission to the intensive care unit ICU and maternal death were classified
as cases The control group included pregnant women with either mild adverse outcomes defined as maternal
hospitalization requiring oxygen supplementation or no adverse outcomes defined as outpatient management
or hospitalization not requiring oxygen supplementation
Identification of risk factors for severe adverse maternal outcome Pregnant women with severe
adverse outcomes cases were compared to pregnant women with mild or no adverse outcomes controls
The effect of maternal characteristics known to be risk for SARS CoV severe adverse outcomes in
the general population were tested i e maternal age years old obesity defined as a BMI hypertensive
