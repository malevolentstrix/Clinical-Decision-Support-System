 on average in other countries this figure is
times In addition while over the last years the gap between
men and women and older in most countries has narrowed
in Ukraine it has widened In our opinion this indicates an
extremely unsatisfactory state of health of the male population
of the country in general and older age groups in particular

Taking into account the world experience of digital
transformation of the social sphere and developed domestic
approaches it is possible to verify further vectors of digital
transformation of the healthcare sphere of Ukraine which
should include introduction of valeological approaches in
providing medical services through prevention and health
promotion digital ecosystem of medical services which will
unite all subjects of their provision the transition from a
fragmented approach to health care delivery to the integration
and coordination of services during treatment
Covid stressed the vulnerability of an aging population
to new diseases Therefore at present the issue of healthy
aging is especially relevant
V METHODS OF CONSTRUCTING THE INDEX OF
POPULATION HEALTH
Health status index models have received a great deal of
attention in as a new quantitative approach for health
planning and health policy making Although at the present
time the models are mainly theoretical and experimental in
nature it is hoped that when they are fully developed and
ready for implementation they will contribute to rational
health planning in two ways first by providing a combined
morbidity mortality health index to measure the overall
health of a population and to allow comparisons of
populations on both a cross sectional and longitudinal basis
and second by providing a method of measuring the health
benefits of a health care program in general units to facilitate
the comparison of different programs in the establishment of
program priorities and in the allocation of limited resources
In Kaltenthaler et al published a systematic review
to identify articles describing population health indices and
their development Nevertheless Kaltenthaler et al
argued that a review on population health indices is beneficial
because indices may facilitate the consideration of allocating
and targeting health resources based on health needs from a
multidimensional perspective
In addition the development of health indices is
knowledgeable for understanding the nature of the factor
consequence relationships between the factors of health and
its level After all a population health index therefore
provides a summary measure of a certain health characteristic
at the population level
In order to better illustrate the aging process and the
impact on it of various factors it is advisable to use the health
index ISH which was proposed by one of the co authors of
the article Shushpanov D The health status index is
defined for each person as a composite index which consists
of the individual health index of the IIP person and the life
expectancy index of the ILE person according to the
The life expectancy index ILE is defined as a person s
age plus life expectancy at that age taking into account gender
and type of area The maximum life expectancy is assumed to
be years The minimum is years
According to the methodology of construction ISH
combines individual and general individual characteristics of
a person s health and general characteristics of the whole set
of persons taking into account their gender and living
conditions in a particular country It should be expected that
with age IIH will tend to decrease and ILE on the contrary
to increase Accordingly the compositional index ISH
balances these trends and thus adequately reflects the state of
health of a person based on potential expected processes and
the actual age reached in a particular country
Consider examples of calculation and use of indices and
characteristics of inequality for the population of Ukraine
Individual health characteristics are determined according to
a sample survey European Social Survey conducted by the
Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of
Ukraine in At the same time five levels of self esteem
are set for each person Accordingly the standardized values
are equal to
In fig show the features of the change of indices by age

It was found that for both men and women IIH is quite high
at a young age years but with age it significantly
decreases in men to at the age of years and older and
in women up to at the same age This is due to a decrease
in self esteem which is usually overestimated at a young age
and underestimated at an older age Especially women have
low self esteem Therefore they have a lower IIH

ILE on the other hand tends to grow As a result in men
aged years and in women aged years ILE and
IIH as well as ISH have the same values ISH is calculated as
the average between IIH and ILE We believe that such a
combination of macro level indicators life expectancy and
micro level indicators individual self assessment of a
person s state of health gives the most complete picture of the
state of health and can serve as a starting point for determining
policies to maintain and improve health
VI CONCLUSIONS
Many countries have been facing the problem of
population aging for more than a decade This list is updated
every year Thus this problem has become global The causes
of population aging are deformations of the sex age structure
of the population a decrease in the birth rate and an increase
in life expectancy
The study established the role of socio economic
development in the aging process and their relationship with
the reproduction regime It is established that there is a
relationship between the level of economic growth and
population aging although with some exceptions in particular
for Ukraine Peculiarities of aging by sex are revealed It is
determined that in Ukraine there is a significant differentiation
in the aging rates between men and women which is
associated with high mortality rates among men
In the conditions of aging it is important to ensure a
healthy old age The realities of today during the COVID
pandemic have shown that the most vulnerable and
vulnerable are the elderly In Ukraine the mortality rate of the
population aged and over remains one of the highest in
Europe especially mortality due to diseases of the circulatory
system According to the results of the author s research the
structure of the prevalence of diseases among the elderly
includes diseases of the circulatory system diseases of the
digestive system musculoskeletal system and connective
tissue
Sociological research has identified determinants that
largely determine the health of the elderly population The
chance assessment method found that the chances of having a
chronic disease of the circulatory system increase with
declining socio economic status among divorced widowed
and smokers
The main task of the health care system in aging is a
systematic and comprehensive approach should cover all
periods of life and is relevant not only for those who are
currently healthy

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objectives This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of contraceptive methods self
reported by men in England over years focusing on condoms in comparison to any male method
and explore condom as a contraceptive method by region and ethnicity
Study design Data were from the Sexual and Reproductive Health Services Contraception England
census data set from to Once missing data were removed this left a total of
men Two binomial logistic regression models were performed Model examined ethnicity region and
time on condom as a method of contraception and Model examined ethnicity region and time by any
male contraceptive Descriptive statistics were run for natural family planning and spermicide
Results Model revealed a significant model P and predicted that condoms as
a method decreased in London with a greater decrease in Midlands London saw the lowest rate of
decline among the non White ethnic group whereas North and South regions increased probability over
time The North started at a higher probability and the South at the lowest Model also revealed a
significant model P with a similar pattern to Model Contingency tables
showed natural family planning and spermicide were the least reported methods and decreased over
time
Conclusions As any male contraceptive method appears to be decreasing in both models reproductive
health promotion is required This study has implications for commissioning funds and for identifying
regional areas of further investigation

A rich history of men and family planning as part of the global
agenda and how this relates to the United Kingdom have already
been documented l While the United Kingdom has yet to report
successful interventions several low and middle income coun
tries have already reported success engaging men For example
research in Malawi suggests that increased communication among
couples is mediated by an increase in knowledge and a decrease in
male opposition within the couple this is described as an essential
part of the intervention s success Despite the United Kingdom
having a history of providing aid for family planning to low and

middle income countries for targeted programming albeit this aid
has recently been cut the United Kingdom has invested very little
funding into research on their own men s family planning practices
including men s use of condoms for contraception natural family
planning or spermicide as a method of contraception leaving little
understanding of men and contraception There is now a public
health movement beginning in the United Kingdom for men to
responsibly ejaculate or in other words take primary re
sponsibility for contraception for which there are currently bar
riers The literature suggests there is a need to further understand
men s choice of contraception to be effective with increasing up
take and overcoming barriers to primary responsibility However
before we can begin to overcome barriers we must start with more
effective data collection techniques and advanced analysis in pub
lished reports to guide decision making For a more in depth re
view of the literature see Supplemental Materials

Aims and exploration
This study objective was to build upon the research of Pearson
and Pearson and Clarke using the same source of national data sets
to understand condoms natural family planning and spermicide as
a contraceptive method of men by region in England over years
from to The data sets available from the National
Health System NHS clinics have some identified limitations by
Pearson and Pearson and Clarke for example the data set lacked
complete demographic information on men such as age although
age was recorded for women Furthermore the data were un
available on men who attend for family planning purposes as part
of a couple because the patient in a couple was recorded to be the
woman partner However some limited information was provided
regarding the ethnic background of men again little is currently
known about how ethnic background informs contraceptive
method reported among men in the United Kingdom Therefore
the second objective of this study was to then explore ethnicity and
contraceptive as a method by men in England It is to the authors
knowledge the first study to begin to understand condom as a
method by region over time It is also the first study to look at
natural family planning and spermicide as a method of contra
ception by men in England
Method
The study was a secondary analysis of data from the NHS Con
traceptive Services England Community contraceptive services
therefore according to the University Ethics Committee this study
was exempt from ethical approval as the data are in the public
domain The primary focus of the data is contraceptive care and the
variable for condoms is labeled by NHS Digital as contraceptive
method and implies that the data collected is for family planning
purposes Therefore it is assumed that the data collected is on
condoms for contraceptive purposes The census is run on a yearly
basis from April to March each year and is considered the most
comprehensive sexual and reproductive service information
resource for the United Kingdom The non disclosive data set
census used for this study included
and The cutoff year was as
these data were collected before the COVID pandemic which
has affected those men who use contraceptive clinics and would
not make for a meaningful comparison at this stage A total of
men participated in the national census from to
The data points are entered by the service provider which includes
national regional and local authorities
Previous research sug
gests this is predominantly nurse practitioners in the United
Kingdom
Data set characteristics
The female participants were removed from the data set using
an excel macro to ensure only male responses were used Similar to
Pearson and Pearson and Clarke there was only one classification
value for males H Male all ages and all observations matching
this value comprised the overall dataset N A robust
sample was an essential part of the inclusion criteria and the
sample consists of data only from the regions of England North
Midlands London and South for a map of these regions see Office
for National Statistics ONS The rationale for
excluding responses outside of England is that there was not
enough data collected over the years on participants from
Northern Ireland n Scotland n and Wales n to
warrant inclusion in the analyses However while limited to En
gland participants did not have to be British nationals to be
Public Health
included as participants foreign nationals could present at services
and were recorded as part of the data set although nationality was
not recorded The remaining men s contraceptive method was
either not recorded or they were using no contraceptive at all
potentially reliant on female methods but exactly how many men
fell into these subgroups was not clear within the data set Once
missing data on contraceptive method was removed from the data
set there was a total of men s data left to analyze With
speculation that some of the excluded with missing data
may have been using the service for sexual health not contracep
tion however without better data collection methods this could
not be confirmed Method as a variable meant the patient reported
what their method of contraception was to the clinician To create
the contraceptive method variable the main method secondary
method and third method were combined into one variable to
measure any method of contraception It did not mean that the
method of contraception was given to the participant or used by
them in practice Therefore this data set then looked at self
reported methods of contraception not contraceptive use Each
year s data were initially combined into a singular data set with
filtering then occurring for each year s data to provide a view of
self reported contraceptive methods over time
Analytic techniques
Two binomial logistic regression models were performed The
first model examined the effect of ethnicity region and time on
condom as a method of contraception The second model examined
the effect of ethnicity region and time on any contraceptive as a
method in comparison to no contraceptive method All P values
reported were two tailed Furthermore two contingency tables
were performed to understand both natural family planning not
defined in the data set by ethnicity region and time as well as for
spermicide by ethnicity region and time R studio was used to
analyze the data All statistical analyses were conducted using
packages in the R statistical environment version
Pack
ages in the R statistical environment refers to additional modules
within R that allow specific analyses to be conducted All the data
were prepared using the R package dplyr
Results
Sociodemographics
The number of males per year were
and from to This shows a steady
decrease from to with the number of men attending
contraceptive services reduced by more than half In the overall
data set were White and were non White The
responses for the ethnic group not known stated were filtered from
the data set because of the lack of clarity whether this was missing
data or the participant refused to answer the question For any
method of contraception overall men reported condom as
a main method of contraceptive reported natural family
planning reported spermicide and men did not report a
main contraceptive method Overall n of men
were recorded as using the clinic as their main contact
n were contacting the clinic for the first time of
men attended a primary healthcare center n with the
majority choosing to maintain their current contraceptive
method n It is acknowledged that n
of men received both contraception and sexual health advice
suggesting they may choose condoms for dual protection contra
ception and sexually transmitted infections STIs However
whether the sexual health advice was sought by the men or
A Jordan and A D Wilson
whether condoms were chosen for dual protection or for non
contraceptive use cannot be distinguished in the data collected
While of men in this study reported that it was their first
contact for their contraceptive method of men reported that
it was not their first contact and they were maintaining their cur
rent contraceptive method Patient identification numbers are used
for every visit to ensure accurate reporting such as ensuring mul
tiple visits are accurately recorded but these identification
numbers are not shared as part of the data set for confidentiality
The researcher therefore chose to include men with
reasons
first and second contacts for contraceptive method as it could not
be determined when the men first accessed the service although
this may bias the data set The frequency and percentages for the
overall data set by demographic category can be found in Table
Model Ethnicity region year and condom as a method
The model used simultaneous forced entry of the variables and
dummy coding of the ethnicity and region variable with those of
White ethnicity and the North region treated as the reference
values respectively This resulted in a significant model
P see Table
for parameter estimates
standard errors and P values
The model revealed that when compared with those in the
North region condom as a method for those of White ethnicity in
the South region had a significantly lower log odds of method at
year O Those of White ethnicity in the London region
had significantly higher log odds and those of White ethnicity in
the Midlands region had no significant difference compared with
those of White ethnicity in the North region Furthermore those of
non White ethnicity had a higher log odds of using condom as a
method at year O when compared with those of non White
ethnicity in the North region The log odds of condom as a
method for those of non White ethnicity at year were lower in the
South and London regions but higher in the Midlands region in
comparison to those of non White ethnicity in the Midlands see
for parameter estimates standard errors and P values
Table
The model also revealed that the log odds of condom as a
method increased over time for those of White ethnicity in the
North region This increase was of a larger magnitude in the South
region but there was a decrease over time in log odds of the
method in the Midlands and London regions Those of non White
ethnicity in the North region had no significant difference
compared with those of White ethnicity in the North region in log
odds of condom as a method over time Compared with the log
odds of condom as a method of those of non White ethnicity in
the North region there was an increase in log odds over time for
those of non White ethnicity in the London region However there
was no significant difference in log odds of condom as a method for
those of non White ethnicity over time in the Midlands and South
regions when compared with the log odds of the method for non
White ethnicities in the North
Overall the model shows that the predicted probability of
condom as a method of contraception for non White and White
ethnicities decreased in the London and Midlands regions over
time and this decrease was at a greater rate in the Midlands region
The rate of decrease over time was slower for non White ethnicities
in the London region The North and South regions had an increase
in predicted probability of condom as a method over time but the
North started as a high predicted probability of the method and the
absolute change is not large in magnitude In contrast the South
started with lowest predicted probability of condom as a method
than all other regions but had the highest rate of increase White
ethnicities had a lower predicted probability of the method across
all time points for all regions

Discussion
Principal findings
In summary the results from our study show that the Midlands
of England have the lowest rates of condom as a main method of
contraception followed by men in London The North and South of
England showed slight increases in condoms and other male con
traceptives Irrespective of year the White ethnic group self report
condoms as a method of contraception less than the non White
ethnic group For the White ethnic group the odds of self
reporting condoms as a contraceptive method decreased yearly in
the Midlands and London regions but the North and South regions
increased yearly Comparatively the overall pattern was almost
identical in the non White ethnic group although at higher odds of
condoms as a contraceptive method across all regions at all time
points However a key difference between ethnicities was seen in
the London region where the White ethnic group decreased over
time at a significantly greater rate Model predicted the self
report of any male contraceptive method and showed a similar
pattern to Model where any male method was decreasing and
uptake was less among men who identified as White than men who
did not identify as White Any male contraceptive method included
condoms natural family planning and spermicide A comparison
was run to understand if the decrease in condoms could be
explained by an increase in other male methods The results sug
gest that the decrease in condoms cannot be explained by an in
crease in any male method Furthermore the White ethnic group
did not self report any form of male method at a higher rate than
the non White ethnic group
rate of increase White ethnicities had a lower predicted probability
of any contraceptive method across all time points for all regions
However in the South and North regions the probabilities appear
to be on a converging path

Methodological implications of ethnicity as a variable
Ethnicity is an irrational variable in the data set it has been
oversimplified and service users are limited to choose from three
categories White non White and other unknown This creates a
binary other White vs non White This approach is an essentialist
view of ethnic background that problematically stereotypes groups
as having one true identity that is biological driven Instead
research suggests that the option should be provided to service users
to self identify as well as providing the ability to give non standard
responses for the complexity of the variable to be explored and new
constructions of ethnic categories to emerge without stigmatization
and discrimination
Furthermore by taking a homogenous
approach to the White ethnic group this ignores other groups that
face disadvantage such as White Irish individuals residing in En
gland While ethnicity is commonly characterized in a problematic
way of race by using skin color the relationship between ethno
cultural group and sexual behavior is important when developing
health based interventions
For example research on Black
Caribbean and Black African heterosexual men show differences in
health care utilization and prognosis for sexual health and STIs
Individuals from mixed racial backgrounds also have differences in
sexual health behaviors for example risk taking among heterosex
ual sexual health clinic service users was highest among Black mixed
Caribbean heterosexual men with this group being most likely to
test positive for STIs These studies show how further ethnic
categorization within a subgroup such as Black and mixed ethnic
backgrounds could be beneficial to better understand how culture
informs condoms for reproductive purposes They suggest that for
the purpose of interventions both social and cultural identities
cannot be isolated from the public health approach Overall there
is a need to provide a more precise understanding of ethnic identity
for the purpose of data collection Owing to the barriers with
ethnic grouping very little can be generalized from the data set but
the model does show that ethnicity and condoms as a method for
contraception are a point requiring further enquiry
Research implications
What the above critical lens suggests is this study s regional
information would be helpful not only to target certain regions for
interventions but also to tailor the interventions to each region
differently Historically and currently there is no published record
of an intervention around improving the use of condoms by men
for contraceptive purposes in England Any larger intervention or
randomized control trial should focus on clinics from all four re
gions to account for variations in condoms as a method of contra
ception or focus on the Midlands to understand why condoms are
reported less for contraception in this region to aim to improve
condom uptake over time For a discussion of natural family plan
ning and spermicide as well as recommendations for the NHS see
Supplemental Materials
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is it provides the first insight into
research on men who live in England s self reported method of
contraception for condoms natural family planning and spermicide
Future research is also needed on male contraceptive methods
because this census data was unable to capture use only self reports
of a method Both the models on condoms and any contraceptive
were significant at the level suggesting the models are a good
fit The limitations of the study included that the data were not
collected by the research team therefore there was little that could
be done to influence the variables available for analysis
Public Health
Furthermore although the focus is stated by NHS Digital to be pri
marily on contraceptive care and the variable is labeled as such in all
data sets the three types of men using this service contraceptive
sexual health both cannot be determined Dividing the three data
points in future data collection is important before any causation can
be determined as it would be advantageous even in this data set to
know whether when separated if the three groups decreased or
increased their choice of contraceptives respectively to better inform
targeted services and programs In addition NHS Digital should add
variables to the data on sexual and reproductive care activity to
include divisions between sexual health advice sought and sexual
health advice provided This division could be a quality check for if
men were using condoms for contraception sexual health or both
purposes which cannot be determined or quality checked in the
census currently Also in this study a comparison was run to see if
the decrease in condoms could be accounted for by other male
contraceptive methods increasing In the future to address the issue
in this study of causation it would be key to have a balanced sample
of men using each of the male methods for an in depth comparison
With a more extensive set of sociodemographic variables for men
greater understanding can be applied including possible explana
tions and implications for clinicians and policymakers For further
limitations see the NHS data quality statements publicly available
online by following the citations for the data sets For example the
data lack representation where a male patient contacts an outpatient
clinic a General Practice a community pharmacist or a retail setting
reporting condoms as a contraceptive method Including both men
who made first contact for their method of contraception and men
for whom it was not their first contact that they were maintaining
their method did not influence the trends of the regression models
in this study but could have biased the results This was because the
sample of men maintaining was too small to change the analysis
outcome or to make a meaningful comparison but it could have
implications in a larger data set and seeking a balanced data set is
important for making conclusions and comparisons in the future
research The data set was limited in reporting patient identification
methods and the NHS Digital should devise a system to reduce
duplicate data points in the data sets and to allow for longitudinal
analysis Finally if the individual is or years their data are
also not included which is problematic as they may have a method
of contraception at this age
Conclusion
In all this is the first study to take a comprehensive overview of
several contraceptive methods including condoms natural family
planning and spermicide all male methods The results from the
regression models predict which regions and which ethnic groups
are more likely to report condoms as a method of contraception and
which groups report any male contraceptive method These models
are helpful to begin to explore differences between regions to inform
commissioning and determined that the decrease in condoms is not
explained by an increase of any male method Several important
targeted approaches toward data collection have been suggested to
improve our understanding of men s contraceptive methods in En
gland with health promotion and policy makers requiring more
evidence based research to inform messages commissioning and
policies when aiming to engage men in family planning behaviors

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Increased efforts have focused on reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in the United
States US Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy chronic hypertension diabetes mellitus very advanced
maternal age and grand multiparity are known contributors to various maternal morbidities as well as
maternal mortality We aimed to evaluate the trends in these risk factors complications among US pregnan
Cies during the last three decades
Methods This is a retrospective study based on the CDC natality database We calculated the annual preva
lence of each risk factor complication from to Joinpoint regression analysis was then used to eval
uate the trends Annual percentage changes APC were calculated for each of the segments identified by the
joinpoint regression and average annual percentage changes AAPC were calculated for the entire period
Relative risks RR comparing the prevalence of each risk factor complication in to its prevalence in
were also calculated Subsequent analyses evaluated the trends of the main risk factors complications
by maternal age groups Statistical significance was determined at p and results were presented with
confidence intervals
Findings Between and the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increased by
AAPC CI that of chronic hypertension increased by AAPC CI that
of diabetes mellitus increased by AAPC CI that of very advanced maternal age
increased by AAPC CI and that of grand multiparity increased by AAPC
CI Chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus increased mostly during the past two decades while
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and grand multiparity increased primarily over the most recent decade
Additionally women of very advanced maternal age had significantly higher rates of hypertensive disorders
of pregnancy chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus throughout our study period
Interpretation Our study shows a marked increase in the prevalence of five pregnancy risk factors complica
tions over the past three decades This may point to a significant deterioration in the health of
US pregnant women which potentially contributes to both maternal morbidity and mortality

Maternal mortality rates in the United States US have more than
doubled during the past three decades increasing from per
live births in to per live births in
Significant increases have also been documented throughout
the years in the prevalence of indicators for severe maternal morbid
ities and pregnancy complications such as acute renal failure pulmo
nary embolism adult respiratory distress syndrome ARDS acute
