Abstract The Study was aimed to explore the relationship
between nature experience activities and the multiple
intelligences with year old children with autism The
results showed that the integration of nature experience
activities can significantly enhance the language of autistic
children self reflection and naturalist intelligence logical
spatial musical interpersonal intelligence also effectiveness
but improved in body intelligence less significant Nature
experience activities designed for children with autism from
tactile sensitive part to play according to the different
characteristics of children with autism to find a suitable
stimulus or reinforcements to help autistic children s
emotional stability Although children with autism often
rejection characteristics of the new things but in this study
found a high acceptance of autistic children to the natural

INTRODUCTION
Touching with nature could contribute to the
development of children s positive emotions including
increased self confidence promoting peer social relations
and racial integration and to enhance the relationship
between teachers and students Crompton Sellar
and to reduce anger and aggression Ulrich Kaplan
and Kaplan Harting et al Brown Odom
Conroy also pointed out that doing activities in the
natural environment for handicapped children could
contribute to the development of their interpersonal
relationships
Generally there are some problems on communication
and interaction behavior for children with autism When
they face to inhuman things such as nature the children
with autism often become more comfortable The teaching
method on autism children emphasizes multisensory Wang
and the experience of touching nature would be the
original and appropriate way
The objects of this study were year old children with
autism and would explore the relationship between nature
experience activities with their development of multiple
intelligences For autistic children they often have some
cognitive sensory emotional and social interaction
problems and it could be stimulated sensory sense through
the experience of contact with nature
METHODS
A Research Objects
The object of this study was one NGO Foundation
special class for children with autism There were
in class and of which four mild autism and for the
moderate autism
B About team teaching teachers
This study was designed on theme courses by the
original class and we tried to involved nature experience
activities into lesson plan content We discussed lesson
amendments with team teaching teacher and the class was
leading the activities by them
C Nature experience activities design
Nature experience activities were designed in accordance
with original theme and integrated with natural materials
such as natural adventure treasure hunt collect leaves
twigs or other natural objects trunk rubbing grass skiing
on coconut leaves imitated small ants crawling roll in the
grass We implemented the curriculum in adjacent park
and the implementation time of IOctober to December
every Thursday morning to OO
D Data collection
This study used participant observation to collect the
change of status of the multiple intelligences of children
before and after each class The scales of multiple
intelligences were assessed by researchers team teaching
teachers as well as Occupational Therapist in accordance
with the status of children on activities The multiple
intelligences scales were modified by each activity
including before and after assessment comprehensive
assessment and special event records
E Analysis methods
The analysis methods were used by descriptive statistical
analysis and paired t test to analyze the difference of the
multiple intelligences and observation records were
extracted and summarized the related conditions of children
in various intelligence activities
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A The linguistic intelligence
In linguistic intelligence it was found significant
differences between before and after activity by paired
t test From Figure I we could see there was no consistency
trend on before and after score of first children but the
score of after activity higher than before for the second and
third child Therefore it was increased on linguistic
intelligence

In addition it was found that children in the nature were
proactive attentiveness than indoor course from the
observation records even for easily distracted children
After the teacher explained most of them could perform
activities in accordance with instructions especially some
activities children more interested in such as pushing ball
looking for natural objects
B The logical intelligence
In logical part there were significant differences of the
two children before and after the activity by paired t test
From Figure there was no difference at four times before
and after scores for first child but the score of after activity
all higher than before for the third child So it was found
two trends were enhanced and another less obvious on
logical intelligence In addition activities associated with
the logical intelligence all could be completed for children
from observation records
D The body intelligence
There was significant differences just on one child before
and after the activity by paired t test in body intelligence
From Figure there was no difference at before and after
scores for the second and third child but the score of after
activity higher than before for the first child So it was
found one was enhanced and another two less obvious on
body intelligence Children could put in activities happily
about body activities such as pushing balls grass skiing
rolling body creeping forward

C The spatial intelligence
There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t test in spatial
intelligence From Figure there was no difference at
before and after scores for the second child but the score of
after activity all higher than before for the first and third
child So it was found two trends were enhanced and
another less obvious on spatial intelligence In addition
children could perform well at activities about spatial
intelligence such as finding trees picking up nature
objects
P O

The difference between before and after on body intelligence
In fact activities with touching nature were excluded by
some children at beginning but they accepted quickly This
is difficult to do for children with autism Moreover
touching different nature materials could usefully reduce
their tactile sensitivity
E The musical intelligence
There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t test in musical
intelligence From Figure there was no difference at
before and after scores for the second child but the score of
after activity was little higher than before for the first and
the after score was obviously higher than before for the
third child So it was found two trends were enhanced and
another less obvious on musical intelligence In addition
children actively participate in activities and nature
experience activities stimulate children to opening their
mouth to sing from observation records

F The interpersonal intelligence
There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t test in interpersonal
intelligence From Figure there was no difference at
before and after scores for the first child but the score of
after activity was obvious difference than before for the
second and third child So it was found two trends were
enhanced and another less obvious on interpersonal
intelligence The nature experience activities were helpful
for children with well order and learning waiting

materials were excluded by some children and loved by the
others even concentrated natural materials only and just

G The self reflection intelligence
and

In Self reflection intelligence it was found significant
differences between before and after activity by paired
t test From Figure there was the great difference than
before for the third child Therefore it was increased on
self reflection intelligence The emotion of children was
reflected when they contact with nature at beginning They
were gradually concentrated on the activity in nature and
more stable on emotion later

In nature observation intelligence it was found
significant differences between before and after activity by
paired t test From Figure the score of second and third
child was the great difference than the first one Therefore
it was increased on nature observation intelligence Natural
A
B
C
Involved with nature experience actives could
significantly enhance the development of language
self reflection and naturalist intelligence of children
with autism and also be promoted on the logical
spatial musical interpersonal intelligence But there
was no significant change on body intelligence
The nature experience activities could be exerted by
tactile sensitivity of children with autism according to
the different characteristics of them to find a suitable
stimulus or reinforcements to help the stability of their
emotion
It was found children with autism have high
acceptance for nature materials although they often
reject to touch new things Therefore the nature
experience activities integrated into the curriculum will
contribute to their learning of children with autism

preservation with a health care provider with lower rates among youth participants P
From a family planning perspective of respondents described counseling as adequate
described it as inadequate and reported not receiving any counseling Participants who
endorsed strong or uncertain parental desire were more likely to report inadequate counseling
P
Gender diverse individuals interested in or undecided about future parenthood were more likely to
consider cryopreservation and report inadequate family planning counseling Therefore current
counseling practices may be insufficient and referral to a fertility specialist should be considered

Literature evaluating the perceived quality
GAHT
of family planning counseling is sparse but study found
that of participants at a gender health program did
not think they received adequate information
To better describe perspectives about fertility preserva
tion and family planning in the transgender population of
the United States we surveyed adults and youth pursuing
GAHT at an endocrinology clinic about fertility related
care We assessed desires for future parenthood and
obstacles to parenthood Furthermore we evaluated for
the presence and adequacy of family planning counseling
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This cross sectional survey study utilized an anonymous non val
idated online survey built on the REDCap electronic data cap
ture platform The study was conducted at a single academic
medical center in the adult and pediatric endocrinology clinics
Individuals referred to these clinics between February and
May for GAHT were screened for eligibility Only individ
uals no older than years of age were eligible for participation
Individuals unable to provide informed consent and vulnerable
populations were excluded This study was reviewed and
approved by an Institutional Review Board
Participant recruitment and informed consent occurred in
person during a clinic visit or post hoc via telephone only for
adults At the conclusion of a clinic visit or after conclusion
for telephone recruitment eligible individuals were offered the
opportunity to participate Informed consent to use de identified
data was verbal for adults and written for youth Participants
were then given a QR code and or emailed a link to the RED
Cap survey The survey was completed at a time and location
convenient to the participant
The REDCap survey was divided into sections demo
graphics family planning and fertility preservation We
included a screening question to ensure the survey was not com
pleted more than once by a single individual In the family plan
ning section we asked about current children desires for future
children and obstacles to parenthood Gender affirming care
priorities related to cryopreservation and participant experien
ces with family planning counseling were addressed in the fertil
ity preservation section The survey instrument is available as a
supplemental document
Our primary measures of interest were the desire for future
parenthood and interest in fertility preservation among transgen
der individuals In addition we assessed obstacles to future par
enthood and the adequacy of family planning counseling in this
cohort Survey responses were compared according to age group
sex assigned at birth and self described parental desire Descrip
tive statistics were ca culated for continuous variables Univari
ate t tests were used to analyze continuous data and chi square
tests of independence were used for categorical data Missing
data points were excluded from analyses All statistical analyses
were completed using SPSS software IBM SPSS Armonk

only another planned to pursue it Notably those who
were interested in or undecided about future parenthood
reported higher interest in gamete cryopreservation but did not
have statistically significant higher planning or completion rates
They were however more willing to stop GAHT for cryopreser

to cryopreservation with higher rates among those with strong or

displays reasons that may prevent future parenthood
selected by survey participants There were individuals either
interested in future parenthood or undecided these participants
more frequently cited financial status and the complexity of the
medical process as reasons that may prohibit future parenthood
In contrast individuals expressed no parental desire they
more frequently identified current parenthood as a reason they
may avoid future parenthood Participants who considered a
future biologically related child important also frequently listed
complexity of the medical process vs P OOI as a
reason that may prevent parenthood However financial status
was not a statistically significant barrier for this group vs

LGBTQ parenting as acceptable however most also
indicated that societal views have no influence on their family

parental desire between adult and youth respondents We
found that transgender individuals with strong or uncer

high rates and were more likely to report inadequate fam

participants completed cryopreservation Our findings add
to the ongoing characterization of family planning desires
among transgender persons Importantly we demon
strated that many gender diverse people of reproductive
age are undecided about future parenthood while pursuing
GAHT and would benefit from further counseling
A recent multi center survey based study of Ameri
can transgender adults reported similar rates of parental
desire as our study They found a mean desire for parent

of transgender adults living in Belgium found that

cohort was years for AMAB and years for AFAB
participants compared with years for our study of trans
gender adults and youth Most studies of transgender
youth comment on desire for future biologically related
children however Canadian study did find that of
participants expressed desire for any future parenthood
Our findings regarding parental desire are very similar to
these studies that show a little more than half of transgen
der persons have interest in future parenthood

related child was important to of participants similar
to prior studies All respondents who placed importance
in a future biologically related child were adults consis
tent with recent observations that biologically related
children may not be important to transgender youth
Adoption appears to be the preferred alternative with
more than of respondents endorsing it in this study
and the existing literature
Furthermore there was sig
nificant variability in desire for a biologically related child
depending on parenting intentions among unde
cided and interested vs among not interested This
is particularly important given evidence for the fertility
impact of GAHT and our finding that one third of indi
viduals presenting for GAHT have not solidified their
intentions for future children
While of respondents in our study considered gam
ete cryopreservation less than either planned to pur
sue or previously completed fertility preservation As
expected participants who expressed strong or uncertain
parental desire were much more likely to consider cryo
preservation compared with those not interested
in parenthood Importantly they did not pursue or com
plete fertility preservation at statistically significant higher
rates Our results are consistent with other published
results study found that of transgender men con
sidered gamete cryopreservation and another found that
of transgender women would have considered fertil
ity preservation if it had been offered In contrast rates
of cryopreservation are usually less than
Simi
larly several studies identify that less than of trans
gender youth in North America complete fertility
preservation with higher rates among transgender
Interestingly studies out of Australia and the
women
Netherlands found rates of sperm cryopreservation among
AMAB gender diverse youth between and pos
sibly related to lower costs
Cessation of GAHT is an important consideration for
gender diverse individuals pursuing cryopreservation as
the impacts on fertility potential are at least partially
reversible when stopped Prior studies indicate that stop
ping GAHT is a barrier to fertility preservation for
of transgender adults
but willingness to stop
GAHT increases with self reported parental desire
From the youth perspective only indicate willingness
to delay GAHT for fertility preservation In our study
only of respondents expressed willingness to stop
GAHT for fertility preservation however respondents
with interest in or uncertainty about future parenthood
expressed a much higher willingness and
respectively to stop hormones We also found that indi
viduals AFAB may be more willing to stop GAHT This
finding accentuates the importance of appropriately timed
counseling prior to the initiation of GAHT which would
eliminate the need to consider stopping hormone therapy
Transgender individuals include cost as a barrier to fer
tility preservation as frequently as of the
We had similar findings in our study with
time
of survey respondents citing cost as a barrier to
gamete cryopreservation and higher rates among those
with strong or uncertain parental desire Fewer respond
ents endorsed their current financial circumstance
as an obstacle to future parenthood Notably individuals
AFAB compared with AMAB were more likely to con
sider cost a barrier to fertility preservation This associa
tion did not persist when considering the financial
implications of future parenthood As such cost may
influence parental desire separate from the price of fertility
preservation Other commonly endorsed reasons that may
prevent future parenthood included lack of desire
and the complexity of the medical process with
complexity more frequently listed by individuals AFAB
Our findings corroborate the obstacles to fertility preserva
tion listed in recent studies as well as the greater influence
of medical complexity on individuals AFAB
Professional societies recommend counseling gender
diverse individuals about the fertility consequences and
family planning options prior to the initiation of
GAHT Despite universal knowledge of the potential
fertility implications of GAHT only of our cohort
reported discussing fertility preservation with a health
care provider with lower rates among youth These find
ings are consistent with counseling rates reported in the
adult and pediatric literature
they indicate an
opportunity to improve fertility counseling for gender
diverse persons Comparatively research indicates clini
cians providing transgender care perceive they perform
counseling at a higher rate While self
reported provider level barriers in that study were low
of clinicians providing transgender care
reported lack of knowledge about fertility implications
and preservation options as an impediment to well
informed discussions with patients
Few studies assess the perceived adequacy of family
planning counseling received by gender diverse individu
als In our study of respondents described counseling
as adequate described it as inadequate and
reported not receiving any counseling whatsoever Ade
quacy of counseling varied with age sex assigned at birth
and parental desire Adults reported adequate counseling
and youth reported no counseling at higher rates respec
tively AMAB individuals also reported higher rates of
adequate counseling than their AFAB counterparts Of
note AFAB individuals were younger in this study which
may explain some of this variability Perhaps most impor
tant individuals pursuing GAHT with strong or uncertain
parental desire reported significantly higher rates of inade
quate counseling These data suggest that current counsel
ing paradigms may be insufficient for those most at risk of
GAHT impacting future family planning Referring this
subset of people to a fertility specialist could improve the
counseling they receive
Our study is not without limitations It was conducted at
an academic endocrinology clinic among gender diverse per
sons of reproductive age presenting for GAHT using a non
validated survey instrument which means the results may
not be generalizable to the larger transgender population
UROLOGY
For example not all gender diverse individuals choose to
medically or surgically transition This decision could influ
ence their response to questions related to fertility related
care Furthermore our survey did not query participants who
provided counseling when that counseling occurred ie
before or after GAHT or which provider ie our institu
tion vs another institution they were considering when
answering the survey Thus our survey may reflect partici
pant perception of counseling provided by our institution
which we hypothesize may be an overestimate due to the
specialized nature of our clinic and limits measurement of
counse ing adequacy prior to initiating GAHT Furthermore
participants in this study were more insured than most
descriptive studies of transgender persons and we likely
underestimated the influence of cost on decision making As
a cross sectional survey based study the influence of response
bias must be considered Approximately of eligible peo
ple declined to participate in the study and of con
sented participants did not complete the online survey it is
difficult to predict how their responses would change the
results of this study Response bias may have also contributed
to the age difference between AMAB and AFAB individu
als Despite these limitations many of our results uphold
findings from population level studies Our findings are also
limited by a small sample size especially for transgender
youth and non binary persons This likely made our study
underpowered to highlight small to moderate differences
between these groups and the general cohort Finally due to
the cross sectional design we could not assess how responses
changed over time For example we could not measure
whether differences between youth and adults remained con
stant or narrowed as adolescents mature
CONCLUSION
Gender diverse individuals interested in or undecided
about future parenthood constitute a sizable portion of
individuals presenting for GAHT Current family plan
ning counseling practices appear to be insufficient for edu
cating and supporting transgender people undergoing
hormonal gender transition especially those interested in
future parenthood As such all persons presenting for gen
der affirming care should be queried about future parental
desire to guide clinician attention to counseling and refer
ral to fertility specialists
