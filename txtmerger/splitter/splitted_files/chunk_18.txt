to see it through it was a flat No there is nothing you can

nancy You just have to see it through I just believed her I thought
Right okay
I was worried that if I did then go ask anybody
else or try and take something it wouldn t be safe for my baby
Like I say she was really friendly She was very personal She
built a good relationship up with you quickly so I felt like No she
knows what she s doing Trust her I was so unwell that I spent
most of my days sleeping
Several participants reflected that the use of carbon monoxide
testing undermined their relationship with midwives who they felt
were trying to catch out women who underreported their smok
ing levels
I always thought it s bizarre asking someone for their subjective
answer and then you are almost like Right well that means abso
lutely nothing because we need to do a test of the carbon monox
ide in your blood anyway I think that s rubbish really because
the relationship between midwife and mother is really really im
portant I think we should be making sure that s as strong as
possible throughout pregnancy l think testing strengthens that
power imbalance between clinician and patient
Several survey respondents also reported their data being
shared with third parties such as Slimming World which further
undermined trust between them and their midwife
Because of my weight high BMI I was offered an additional ser
vice about losing weight which I did not want I declined and it
still was pushed on me and she turned up to my appointment
without my consent survey respondent
A breakdown in trust has serious implications for women s rela
tionships with their midwives and other care givers Although
n of survey participants reported feeling trusted to decide
what was best for themselves and their babies n re
ported that they sometimes felt judged by HCPS for their choices
and actions Some described lying to their midwives about their
behaviours because they felt judged
I generally felt I was judged for some of the foods I ate and the
occasional alcoholic drink As a pharmacist I used my professional

midwife about my choices survey respondent
Stigmatised communication of risk
We identified that younger women years old and women
with higher BMIs had a distinct and stigmatised experience of ma
ternity care
Younger mothers
Women who became mothers under the age of had a dis
tinct experience of risk messaging and several described the ad
vice they received as instructional One woman explained that she
felt like if I didn t do something with my first baby especially
that they d take my baby off me or something One in
terview participant with four children said that the advice
she received during her pregnancies changed as she got older Dur
ing her first pregnancy she found the support from a health visi
tor to be useful but condescending In contrast during her later
pregnancies she found HCPS to be more respectful of her wishes
One woman WRIII suggested that family and friends compen
sated for a lack of information provided about labour and birth by
HCPs and was concerned that women even younger than herself
may find the paucity of advice and information scary sug
gested that all first time mothers should be treated the same re
gardless of their age
I think they should be treated like any other first time mum
because I bet there are odd year old mums out there that prob
ably know the same amount as an year old who s pregnant for
the first time If you ve not done it before you don t know
Another younger participant reflected on how partial advice left
them unprepared for the consequences of obstetric injuries
I wish I d known more about obviously tears and stuff
it
was the sort of situation where they said about it but they sort
of went Oh you re young you won t have to worry about that
sort of thing Third degree tears normally happen to older ladies
Women with higher BMIs
of survey respondents reported
Approximately n
feeling judged because of their weight and described dehumanisa
tion and depersonalisation within the maternity care system This
is exemplified by one woman who was present for conversations
about how staff would move her should she become incapacitated
in labour
I accept that there is also the risk of the idea of my body as an
object which is large Therefore in itself poses a risk to staff who
R Blaylock H Trickey J Sanders et al
are handling my body That is a very depersonalising way to think
about oneself I m aware that is something that has to be consid
ered but I feel quite strongly that risk needs to be considered in
private and not in front of me
Another described how her weight dominated every interaction
with HCPs leading her to feel like her pregnancy would not end
with a healthy baby
My weight dominated every conversation held with every single
medical professional and led me and my partner to be absolutely
convinced we wouldn t bring the baby to term We were told re
peatedly that the birth would be difficult I wouldn t cope and that
there would be complications I was told to have an epidural at
the first signs of labour as I would def need emergency interven
tion so it made sense to do it at the beginning as I wouldn t be
able to control myself enough once the labour had started to do
it later on I was almost convinced I wouldn t be bringing my
baby home and even didn t do things like put up a cot survey
respondent
Participants also described a failure to recognise efforts they
had made in the preconception period to mitigate against risk
I was overweight and many of my appointments seemed to fo
cus more on my weight than anything else despite the fact that I
proved I had lost more than stone in the months before falling
pregnant survey respondent
and a failure to contextualise risk
As I m overweight I felt very anxious all the way through the
pregnancy as I was constantly being told I was at a higher risk
but no one could tell me by how much It regularly made me feel
like I wasn t good enough to have a baby survey respondent
Discussion
Overall participants wanted a balance between a better safe
than sorry approach and evidence based information and advice
Whilst most women were happy to adopt the precautionary prin
ciple others wanted more detailed information relating to risk A
need for a well informed layered approach to information provi
Sion was evident to support honest discussions about risk includ
ing where there was uncertainty
Other research on pregnancy related COVID public health
messages found that women felt it was better to be safer than
sorry and over interpreted advice to stringently socially distance
shielding from the outside world Sanders and Blaylock
Reflecting the hesitancy amongst pregnant women to accept the
COVID vaccination Skirrow et al Blakeway et al
in this research we found that even when counselled on the im
portance of using medication by HCPs some women preferred not
to do so out of fear of harming their baby leaving them vulner
able to serious deterioration in their health Whilst the adoption
of the precautionary principle may be considered effective public
health messaging we found concerning examples that the precau
tionary approach enacted through self policing behaviours can lead
to negative outcomes for the woman herself We found that dif
ferent women had different appetites for risk and this was often
shaped by previous experiences Whilst cognisant of the fact that
there was unlikely to be a causative link between a behaviour such
as carrying something heavy or drinking a small amount of alco
hol and miscarriage some women having experienced miscarriage
felt that no avoidable risk was acceptable when it came to sub
sequent pregnancies However this was not universal and what
may have been a small or negligent risk to one person e g drink
ing a small amount of alcohol may have felt like a huge risk to
another
Midwifery
Women have different appetites for risk with their tolerance
often changing over time shaped by their own experiences In the
absence of any evidence of harm about a particular behaviour
they should be free to adopt or reject the precautionary princi
ple
McDonald et al However it becomes more challeng
ing where there is a known risk to the fetus such as in the pre
scribing of drugs with teratogenic effects such as Sodium Valproate
Valproate Pregnancy Prevention Programme Whilst being
well motivated formal healthcare guidelines that mandate a pre
cautionary approach undermine women s autonomy are stigma
tising and remove their ability to make decisions for themselves
Royal College of Midwives Lee et al Increasingly
women who make what others deem to be risky decisions are
seen as transgressive according to social norms which dictate what
an ideal mother should do
Kukla
Our participants explained that there was a mismatch between
the topics they received a lot of information on and areas in
which they felt they needed more advice and support For ex
ample smoking and drinking alcohol in pregnancy were identi
fied as topics which participants received a lot of information
In contrast participants wanted more advice on managing men
tal health conditions during pregnancy Some participants felt that
this over focus on certain topics caused them to experience bad
outcomes such as post natal depression Gaps in the information
provided to pregnant women and conflicting advice may leave
them to make their own decisions without any support With
out any guidance from healthcare professionals on issues such as
whether it is safe to take particular medications in pregnancy they
are left to the mercy of the sea in which they swim the prevail
ing cultural ideas about what is and is not appropriate behaviour
in pregnancy and the imperative to protect the foetus at all costs
even at their own expense Maternity Decisions Induction Survey
The attention given to some topics in public health messag
ing during pregnancy arguably reflects the research agenda and
accessibility of data There is a trend particularly within the De
velopmental Origins of Health and Disease DOHaD paradigm to
use large cohort studies to ascertain associations between mater
nal exposures and foetal outcomes There is an implicit assumption
about the causal primacy of maternal pregnancy effects and this
sets the agenda of DOHaD research which is reinforced and repro
duced rather than challenged Sharp et al Our research on
the reporting of pregnancy related studies found that the majority
of studies that were reported in the UK mainstream media frame
mothers rather than protective towards their unborn infants as
vectors of potential harm to their children who are the focus of
the health outcomes Marshall et al A recent report found
an imbalance between women s research priorities such as peri
natal mental health and research funding suggesting a realign
ment of research priorities with women s needs is urgently needed
Guthrie et al
The use of carbon monoxide testing to validate women s self
reported behaviours and referrals to additional support without
consent were described as undermining the relationship between
women and their midwives Others have also identified the use of
carbon monoxide testing in maternity care as having the poten
tial to do more harm than good Bowden By not trusting
women s self reports testing for carbon monoxide exposure leaves
women feeling judged and not trusted which could lead to disen
gagement with services and is at odds with shared decision mak
ing
O Brien et al We found that when they felt judged
women were more likely to lie or hide their behaviour which
is consistent with findings from other research on working class
mothers and smoking in Wales Grant et al
Women with higher BMIs and younger mothers reported rou
tine stigmatisation dehumanisation and a lack of kindness within
R Blaylock H Trickey J Sanders et al
maternity care Younger women described feeling they risked hav
ing their baby taken into care if they did not comply with instruc
tions To receive care under such a climate of fear hinders the for
mation of trusting relationships between women and their health
care providers Sanders et al McLeish and Redshaw
Furthermore around a quarter of women felt judged for their
weight As mentioned previously when women feel judged they
are less likely to engage in healthcare which can have ramifications
for maternal and foetal health
Women with higher BMIs described the distress caused by hav
ing to repeat their story multiple times and a failure to recog
nise the weight loss journey they may have been on prior to each
appointment meeting each new midwife Within expanding mid
wifery continuity of carer MCoC teams midwives should be able
to provide more individualised care
Some of our participants described being told they were at
risk or had a high risk pregnancy but not being told how much
greater their risk of a poor outcome was This was particularly
the case with risk factors which were unmodifiable at the time
of pregnancy such as having a high BMI or suffering from a pre
existing health condition This failure to contextualise risk derives
from how risk is calculated from population level epidemiological
studies and extrapolated and applied to the individual in a clinic
setting
WRISK
Pregnancy is often characterised as a teachable moment dur
ing which healthcare professionals can educate women and im
prove their health Atkinson et al This leads to a greater fo
cus on the individual determinants of health rather than the social
or structural determinants of health which require a longer lead
time and collective population level efforts to resolve This fo
cus on the individual determinants of public health is a departure
from current trends within public health more broadly which fo
cus on social determinants Acknowledging the diffculty in trying
to solve public health problems in a month window there is a
growing focus on improving women s health in the pre conception
period regardless of their pregnancy planning intentions Budds
Whilst we did not interview HCPs we identified that system
level constraints also contribute to the poor communication of
risk and public health messages The sheer volume of pub
lic health initiatives and information provided on a wide range
of topics means that antenatal care appointments can become
tick box exercises rather than tailoring the appointment to
meet a woman s individual needs Midwives are constrained
by short appointment times a lack of training and resources
Sanders et al which inevitably means that some infor
mation is prioritised This is compounded by serious staff short
ages NHS Again MCoC may contribute to more individ
ualised care but plans for universal implementation have been
delayed
Sandall et al Delivering Midwifery Continuity
These structural issues mean the quality of a woman s ante
natal experience is contingent on who they happen to see that
particular day how knowledgeable they are and whether they
have time to meet their individual needs This is evidenced by
our findings that a woman with Hyperemesis Gravidarum was
told by her midwife that there was no safe medication that
she could take More recently anecdotal evidence emerged of
pregnant women being turned away from COVID vaccination
centres or being told by their midwives that vaccination for
COVID is not safe in pregnancy contrary to the evidence
base
The Guardian Ultimately we are yet to decide who
gets to choose what is an acceptable risk to take in pregnancy
Women s and HCPs appetites for risk might be different and when
they are discordant this can lead to gatekeeping and conflicting
advice
Midwifery
Strengths and limitations
Our study included over women from across the UK
Our purposive sampling frame ensured our interview population
included higher proportions of ethnic minorities and women on
low incomes than at the UK population level ensuring the most
marginalised women were represented However the sampling
frame design may have shaped our findings and focused atten
tion on certain experiences of risk communication at the expense
of others for example the stigmatisation of women with higher
BMIs
Our survey was self selecting and may reflect the views of
those more motivated to participate in research Given the survey
was hosted online we are mindful that it excluded those with
out access to the internet Furthermore our survey and interviews
were restricted to those who could speak English and therefore ex
cluded non English speakers who are likely to have more diffcul
ties accessing and navigating the maternity care system in the UK
Conclusion
Our research shows the importance of risk communication that
respects women s autonomy and trusts them to make decisions
about their own pregnancy Our findings support principles which
have been previously identified in aiding high quality risk com
munication and we recommend that HCPs involved in delivering
risk messages familiarise themselves with these Freeman
We identified a need for a layered approach to risk communica
tion Whilst some women are happy to adopt precautionary be
haviour without discussion others will want a thorough exami
nation of the evidence base and its limitations Our findings sug
gest that more individualised care continuity and less judgement
and stigmatisation from HCPS will improve experiences for women
and may lead to better engagement with services A realignment
of research priorities with women s own needs will likely lead
to improved evidence to support their care Ultimately our re
search demonstrates that women want what is best for their preg
nancy and children Women should be well informed and then
trusted and supported to make decisions based on their own
circumstances

option
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to compare viral suppression at delivery
among patients on dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors com

higher with the use of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
backbone combined with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor than with
the use of a dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone
combined with a protease inhibitor

Comment
Principal findings
In this year cohort of pregnant
patients with HIV who delivered at our
institution complete viral suppression
at delivery was associated with an
INST I based combined ART regimen
instead of a PI based combined ART
regimen Among patients who did have
viremia at delivery there was no differ
ence in viral load among patients on an
INST I based regimen vs among patients
on a P I based regimen in a cohort with
viral load representing the main objec
tive marker of adherence Over time
during the study period the use of
INSTI increased whereas the use of PI
decreased likely reflecting evolving clin
ical guidelines and increasing safety and
efficacy data for INSTI in individuals of
childbearing age and pregnancy More
over we theorize that this trend demon
strates indirect evidence of improved
patient adherence and patient and pro
vider preference over a decade

In our large referral center our practice
is to continue virologically suppressive
regimens in pregnant patients who report
adherence with frequent viral monitoring
Moreover these patients were included in
the INSTI cohort In our experience a
once daily complete regimen with low
pill burden and few side effects is ideal
for adherence and leads to successful viral
suppression at delivery Over the past
decade vertical transmission of HIV has
become extremely rare with the transition
to an INSTI based dual NRTI regimen in
our patient population

known

among the regimens studied In addi

suggested more rapid viral suppression
with the use of INST I based regimens
compared with the use of non lNSTI

ence in undetectable viral load among
pregnant patients near delivery on an
INST I based regimen compared with a
P I based regimen However the authors
found that patients in the INSTI group
demonstrated a lower median viral load
and a greater viral load reduction near
delivery Most patients on an INSTI
based regimen in that study were on ral
tegravir as opposed to dolutegravir and
this may explain the lack of statistical
difference in viral load at delivery
However acceptance and preference
for INSTI during pregnancy have not
been without challenges An interim
analysis of a birth outcomes surveillance
study in Botswana released online in
published in by Zash et al
highlighted a slightly higher prevalence
of neural tube defects in patients taking
dolutegravir at conception with per
deliveries compared with per
deliveries in patients taking other
types of ART at conception The result
ing transition away from the use of
INSTI was swift among infectious dis
ease providers caring for individuals
with childbearing potential and this
effect is suggested by a dip in INSTI use
reflected in pregnant patients in
Figure However the final analysis
of the data published by Zash et al in
demonstrated that this difference
was not statistically significant and that
the trend in INSTI use again increased
in our cohort after
Clinical implications
In the absence of a randomized controlled
trial to determine superiority between
INSTIs and PIs in pregnancy we demon
strate superior viral suppression at delivery
with INSTI vs PI based regimens over a
decade of treating underserved patients liv
ing with HIV The results of our study may
help clinicians considering regimens for
ART nai e pregnant patients or for their
patients who have not achieved complete
viral suppression on a given regimen We
now prescribe dolutegravir with dual
NRTI backbone as a first line treatment
for all patients initiating ART in pregnancy
regardless of trimester

Background Pregnancy risk perception affects a pregnant woman s decision about health care services such as prenatal care
place of birth choices about medical interventions adherence to medical procedures and recommendations Therefore the
study is aimed at assessing pregnancy risk perception and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal
care at health centers in Jabi Tehnan District Methods An institutional based cross sectional study was conducted among
mothers attending ANC at health centers in the Jabi Tehnan District from April to Data was collected
through a face to face interview using a structured questionnaire which was developed according to the health belief
model The logistic regression model was used using an adjusted odds ratio with CI and pvalue to declare
significance and associations Result Four hundred twenty four pregnant women were interviewed of which nearly
half of the respondents had good pregnancy risk perception Women who had a history of obstetric
complications AOR CI those who knew at least one pregnancy danger sign AOR CI
pregnant women who had a bad obstetric history AOR CI and knowing women who
died due to pregnancy related complications AOR were more likely to have good perception
towards pregnancy risk compared to their counterparts Conclusion Obstetric complications awareness of pregnancy danger
signs bad obstetric history and known women who died due to pregnancy related complications were found to be
significantly associated with pregnancy risk perception
Background
Risk perception means an individual s expectation about the
probability characteristics and severity of an event and it is
an important construction for different health behavior theories
such as the health belief model protection motivation theory
and prospect theory An individual making a judgment
about the probability of an event is based on experience
A greater perception of health risks leads to conducting
protective action Therefore it is important to understand
the perception of health risks of pregnancy and the accuracy
of those perceptions Pregnancy risk perception affects a
pregnant woman s decision about health care services like
prenatal care place of birth choices about medical interven
tions adherence to medical procedures and recommenda
tions and health behaviors
Pregnancy is a normal physiological process but some
of the common discomforts of pregnancy may make the
pregnant woman feel ill Ranging from mildly irritating to
life threatening conditions pregnancy and childbirth
are often perceived as normal life events without justifica
tion in many developing countries including Ethiopia
Obstetric complications are high among normal pregnan
cies These complications occurred following warning signs
called obstetric danger signs
The top commonly manifested danger signs during
labor and childbirth are severe vaginal bleeding prolonged
labor convulsions and retained placenta Besides danger
ous signs might occur during the postnatal period which
include severe vaginal bleeding unconsciousness and fever
Every pregnant woman is at risk of facing
pregnancy related complications that could end in death
or injury to both herself and the newborn From
pregnancy related complications hemorrhage obstructed
labor pregnancy induced hypertension puerperal sepsis
and unsafe abortion are the five leading causes of maternal
death in Ethiopia from to Early detection and
management of those complications are important to
reduce maternal mortality
Pregnancy and childbirth complications are major causes
of maternal death Complications that develop during
pregnancy account for of maternal deaths are called
direct causes of maternal death Globally the magnitudes
of direct cause s maternal death are hemorrhage
pregnancy induced hypertension puerperal sepsis
and unsafe abortion In Ethiopia hemor
rhage obstructed labor pregnancy
induced hypertension puerperal sepsis
and unsafe abortion are major causes of maternal
death
Due to obstetric complications globally every day
women died The developing countries accounted for
of these deaths Of these eighty six percent
of deaths are occurred in both Sub Saharan Africa and
Southern Sub Saharan Africa has the highest maternal
mortality ratio at of maternal deaths
annually In Ethiopia the maternal mortality ratio is sig
nificantly reduced from deaths per live births
to death per live births but it
remains high
The maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in
is twenty times higher than in developed countries
The difference in maternal mortality ratio is also present
within countries between urban and rural residents and
between high and low income women
Pregnancy and childbirth related mortality are unavoid
able due to three delays These are delays in deciding to
International Journal of Reproductive Medicine
seek care delays in accessing and reaching appropriate
care and delays in receiving appropriate care once a
health facility is reached The first delay influences the
probability of the second and third delay Their poor per
ception of pregnancy related risks and complications leads
pregnant women to delay decision making to seek obstet
ric care
Therefore this study is intended to determine pregnancy
risk perception and associated factors among pregnant
women attending antenatal care at health centers in Jabi
Tehnan District Amhara Northwest Ethiopia
Methods
Study Area and Period The study was conducted in
Jabi Tehnan District West Gojjam Zone Amhara Region
Northwest Ethiopia Jabi Tenhnan is bordered on the
southwest by Dembech on the west by Bure on the
northwest by Sekela on the north by Kuarit and on the
east of Degadamot district It is located at km from
Addis Ababa in the northwest part of Ethiopia According
to the report from the district in it has kebeles
with a total population of and adults In
the district there are health centers and health
posts The health centers give different clinical services
such as family planning antenatal care delivery and test
ing of HIV for the nearby community All health centers
provide ANC services for the nearby community The
majority of the inhabitants practiced Orthodox Christian
ity while were Muslim This study
was conducted from April to April
Study Design Institution based cross sectional study
design was employed
Source and Study Population The source population of
this study was all pregnant women coming to antenatal care
service in Jabi Tehnan District health centers and the study
population was all pregnant women attending to antenatal
care service in Jabi Tehnan District health centers during
the data collection period
Sample Size Determination The sample size was calcu
lated using the single population proportion formula by con
sidering of the population has good pregnancy risk
perception The size of the sample was calculated as follows
x p l p
i n was the sample size
ii was the confidence interval standard
value of
iii P was the estimated proportion of patients with
good pregnancy risk perception
