ent The study focused on women
actively seeking healthcare services during both
ante and post natal periods at hospitals or
clinics
Ethical clearance was diligently obtained from
the relevant authority of
the hospital
Subsequently informed consent was secured
from all participants selected through random
sampling for the study Prior to obtaining
consent the purpose of the research was
thoroughly explained to each participant It was
emphasized that participation was entirely
voluntary and individuals had the right to decline
or withdraw from the study at any stage even
after providing initial consent Importantly
patients who opted not to participate were
assured that their decision would not affect their
access to routine care available at the facility
The study included a cohort of pregnant
women regularly attending the antenatal clinic at
the hospital The age range of the participants
spanned from to years Exclusions from
the study comprised women currently on any
form of malaria chemoprophylaxis those testing
positive for human immunodeficiency virus HIV
and individuals with sickle cell disease These
exclusions were made to ensure a more focused
and homogenous study population
Design
and Adminstration of
Questionnaire
Two hundred self administered semi
structured questionnaires were meticulously
designed and then distributed to pregnant
women to assess the impact of malaria The
questionnaires sought information on various
including
socio demographic
aspects
characteristics the distribution pattern and
prevalence of malaria fever among pregnant
women Additionally the survey delved into
environmental factors contributing to the spread
of malaria the socio economic status of the
mothers and the public health management of
malaria This comprehensive approach in
questionnaire development aimed to capture a
broad spectrum of data enabling a thorough
analysis of the multifaceted factors related to
malaria among pregnant women
Data Collection
and Sampling
Techniques
Primary data
To bolster the reliability of the research and
achieve its objectives the study employed pre
coded and semi structured questionnaires
These instruments were administered to a
sample of pregnant women attending
antenatal care The collected information
encompassed various domains including socio
demographic characteristics the distribution
pattern and prevalence of malaria fever among
pregnant women Additionally the questionnaires
delved into environmental factors contributing to
the spread of malaria the socio economic status
of the mothers and the public health
management of malaria The use of structured
questionnaires ensured a systematic and
standardized approach to data collection
facilitating a comprehensive analysis of factors
related to malaria among pregnant women
Secondary data
In addition to the questionnaire based data
collection information was gathered by visiting
multiple Health Centers in the study area This
involved procuring records of malaria distribution
in pregnant women over the past four years
By including this retrospective data
the study aimed to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the trends and
patterns of malaria prevalence among pregnant
women in the specified timeframe This dual
approach combining current survey data with
historical health center records contributes to a
more nuanced analysis and interpretation of the
factors influencing malaria distribution in the
study area
Sample Selection
The sample selection for this research was
conducted through a random process among
pregnant women registered for antenatal care at
the selected hospitals Specifically every third
woman attending the antenatal clinic occurring
every other day was chosen to participate in the
study Selected individuals were provided with
detailed information about the research including
its purpose and their consent for participation
was obtained before any sample collection took
place This approach to sample selection
ensures a degree of randomness and
representation among the pregnant women

participating in the study enhancing the reliability
and validity of the research findings Additionally
the informed consent process upheld ethical
standards by clearly communicating the study s
objectives and obtaining voluntary agreement
from the selected participants
Validity and Reliability of the
Questionnaire Instrument
Content Validity The questionnaire was
carefully designed to ensure content validity
Experts in the field of public health and malaria
research reviewed the questions to confirm that
they effectively addressed the intended
variables This process enhances the content
validity ensuring that the instrument accurately
measures the desired constructs
Face Validity Before distribution a pilot test
involving a small group of pregnant women was
conducted to assess
the clarity and
appropriateness of the questions Adjustments
were made based on their feedback contributing
to face validity by confirming that the instrument
appeared relevant and understandable to the
target population
Construct Validity The questionnaire aimed to
measure a variety of constructs related to
malaria including socio demographic factors
prevalence environmental contributors socio
economic status and public health management
This comprehensive coverage enhances the
construct validity ensuring that the questionnaire
effectively measures the intended variables

admission records for pregnant women from
to reveal distinctive patterns At the
General Hospital Ikire there has been fluctuation
in admission rates ranging from a peak of
to a low of Notably this suggests a
relatively low overall rate of hospitalization
among the registered pregnant women during
this period A similar trend is observed at Omoda
Health Centre Ikire where admissions were
notably low reaching non admission for all
registered pregnant women in Although
there is a slight increase in admissions in
infrequent
the overall pattern
indicates
hospitalizations Emmanuel Hospital Ikire also
reflects a relatively low admission rate with the
highest recorded rate being in In
contrast Boluwatife Convalescent Home Ikire
categorized as a primary health center with
limited facilities primarily treated pregnant
women as outpatients resulting in recorded
admissions of NIL This collective data across
healthcare facilities suggests a noteworthy
observation a substantial number of pregnant
women may not have undergone malaria
parasite tests unless prompted by specific
complaints indicating a potential gap in
systematic testing practices This highlights the
need for a more comprehensive and proactive
approach to screening pregnant women for
malaria parasites ensuring early detection and
appropriate management for the well being of
both the mothers and their unborn children
The findings from the conducted study reveal a
concerning prevalence of malaria among
pregnant women in the study area A substantial
of the tested pregnant women were positive
for malaria parasites indicating a high burden of
the disease within the community Further
analysis of the results shows that of the
cases exhibited a high level of malaria parasites
suggesting a significant proportion of individuals
with a more severe and potentially complicated
infection Additionally displayed scanty
malaria parasites which may point to early or
mild stage infections
In contrast of the tested pregnant women
showed no detectable malaria parasites while
had no parasites of any kind While this is a
positive aspect it highlights the need for a
nuanced understanding of the varying degrees of
infection within the population
The overall prevalence rates underscore the
urgent need for targeted interventions to address
the high incidence of malaria among pregnant
women in the area Implementing robust and

These findings bring to light the importance of
implementing effective control measures for
malaria in the general non pregnant population
The prevalence among non pregnant women
signals the need for comprehensive strategies
including widespread testing
preventive
interventions and appropriate treatment to curb
the impact of malaria on the overall health of the

The findings from Table highlight a
commendable level of awareness and
understanding of malaria among pregnant
women in Irewole LGA Osun State All
respondents demonstrated knowledge
about malaria its transmission and had
experienced a malaria attack aligning with
similar studies globally The timing of
recent malaria attacks with reporting
incidents within the past week emphasizes the
urgency for timely intervention strategies and
continuous monitoring consistent with findings in
a neighboring state
Moreover
the majority of
respondents
recognized the potential fatality of untreated
malaria and common symptoms
consistent with studies in different
countries illustrating a global understanding of
the severe consequences of untreated malaria
during pregnancy

contributing to the spread of malaria Similar
studies in malaria endemic regions have
highlighted the significance of environmental
factors in malaria transmission The
acknowledgment of poor sanitation and
overgrown weeds aligns with a study in
a different Nigerian locality suggesting that
interventions addressing environmental factors
could be universally applied in various regions
Table Socio economic Status of
Mothers Regarding Malaria Epidemics
Table explores the socio economic aspects
influencing malaria epidemics among pregnant
women The belief that one s occupation
determines the density of malaria
echoes findings from a study in a neighboring
state However the majority disputing the
impact of income on the effect of malaria fever
on pregnancy contrasts with a study in a
different African region emphasizing the need for
context specific
interventions
The
recognition of the role of education in the spread
of malaria fever suggests a potential
knowledge gap that requires targeted health
education campaigns resonating with a study in
a similar context
Table Public Health Management of
Malaria
Table delves into treatment seeking behavior
and practices related to malaria management
The diverse range of health seeking practices
including visits to quack traditional men or
prophets reflects a complex health
landscape that requires culturally sensitive
interventions The preference for specific
antimalarial drugs such as Sulphadoxine or
pyrimethamine fansidar by
of
respondents is consistent with regional drug
preferences documented in a study in a
neighboring state However the varying

Several parallels with existing
research
underscore the consistency of findings regarding
environmental factors
socio
awareness
economic influences and healthcare seeking
behaviors among pregnant women in malaria
endemic regions However nuanced
differences highlight the need for tailored
interventions considering local contexts and
perceptions
CONCLUSION
Malaria remains a significant public health
challenge in Africa affecting approximately
countries including Nigeria where about
million people are at risk Pregnant women and
their unborn babies are particularly vulnerable to
malaria infection posing a threat to life in
communities The study focused on Irewole
Local Government
revealing the typical
characteristics of a malaria endemic area
Despite the challenges the study emphasizes
that concerted efforts community awareness
and effective strategies can bring about positive
change
The research uncovered overlooked intricacies
that if addressed could contribute to reducing
the scourge of the disease It shed light on the
strengths and weaknesses of both governmental
and non governmental approaches to public
health problems Governments are urged to
move beyond lip service and take substantive
actions to address issues affecting citizens
RECOMMENDATIONS
To address the prevalent challenges of malaria in
the study area a multifaceted approach is
recommended Aggressive vector
control
strategies should be implemented at both
community and household levels integrating
them into a comprehensive plan to manage and
reduce malaria transmission Promoting the use
of insecticide treated nets and exploring
innovative methods to enhance net effectiveness
can significantly interrupt human vector contact
Intermittent preventive treatment particularly with
sulphadoxine pyrimethamine during the second
Oladeji et al Asian J Preg Childb vol no pp Article no AJPCB
and third trimesters is advised for pregnant
women with special attention to those who are
HIV positive
Prioritizing
environmental
sanitation coupled with aggressive information
dissemination campaigns will further contribute
to a robust malaria prevention and control
strategy Engaging various stakeholders in these
efforts is crucial for success requiring resource
allocation and logistical support for effective
implementation
Adopting
these
recommendations promises a more holistic
approach to combating malaria in the study area
and beyond

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Clinical decision support systems CDSSs can provide various functions and advantages to
healthcare delivery Quality healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth is of vital importance and machine
learning based CDSSs have shown positive impact on pregnancy care
Objective This paper aims to investigate what has been done in CDSSs in the context of pregnancy care using
machine learning and what aspects require attention from future researchers
Methods We conducted a systematic review of existing literature following a structured process of literature
search paper selection and filtering and data extraction and synthesis
Results research papers were identified on the topic of CDSS development for different aspects of pregnancy
care using various machine learning algorithms We discovered an overall lack of explainability in the proposed
models We also observed a lack of experimentation external validation and discussion around culture ethnicity
and race from the source data with most studies using data from a single centre or country and an overall lack
of awareness of applicability and generalisability of the CDSSs regarding different populations Finally we found
a gap between machine learning practices and CDSS implementation and an overall lack of user testing
Conclusioru Machine learning based CDSSs are still under explored in the context of pregnancy care Despite
the open problems that remain the few studies that tested a CDSS for pregnancy care reported positive effects
reinforcing the potential of such systems to improve clinical practice We encourage future researchers to take
into consideration the aspects we identified in order for their work to translate into clinical use
The rapid advancement of computer technology has led to an in
creasing interest in clinical decision support systems CDSSs which
are computer systems designed to impact clinician decision making
about individual patients at the point in time that these decisions are
made CDSSs can provide various functions and advantages to
healthcare delivery such as reducing medication errors and adverse
events improving clinical management controlling costs providing ad
ministrative function automation supporting diagnostics and decision
making improving documentation and streamlining clinical workflow
CDSSs can be especially helpful during the COVID pandemic
when many clinicians have turned to telemedicine in response to the
need for social distancing

CDSSs can be classified as knowledge based and non knowledge
based A knowledge based CDSS typically includes a knowledge base
consisting of compiled information that is often in the form of rules
and it combines the rules with patient data using an inference engine
or reasoning mechanism to create outputs On the contrary non
knowledge based CDSSs are data based and they do not rely directly on
medical guidelines or knowledge A common type of non knowledge
based CDSSs uses machine learning techniques and this type of CDSSs
is often referred to as machine learning based CDSSs Machine learning
is a type of artificial intelligence that learns from historical data
and uses what it learned to predict the outcomes for new data It is a
powerful tool to address complex problems and it can handle varieties
of data including numerical categorical time series textual and im
age data Machine learning is widely adapted in the medical field

and it has shown revolutionary improvements in many aspects of the
healthcare process Consequently there has been a rapid growth in
machine learning based CDSSs to help clinicians make better and more
informed decisions
Bias has been a major concern when applying machine learning in
practice as biases in the data such as ethnicity race or gender can
result in a biased model In the field of medicine there is a growing
demand for approaches to be trustworthy transparent interpretable
and explainable Antoniadi et al indicated that explainability is
a critical component for the effective uptake of CDSSs in practice and
it may become a requirement in the future due to ethical regulatory
and societal pressures This calls for explainable artificial intelligence
XAI to help uncover potential sources of bias and make the results
of systems more understandable to humans Various benefits
have been reported as a result of the use of XAI however XAI is still
not applied sufficiently in the context of machine learning based CDSSs
Quality healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth can prevent ad
verse pregnancy outcomes including maternal deaths and stillbirths
In the context of pregnancy care studies have shown that CDSSs
can identify complications during pregnancy improve quality of intra
partum care facilitate reduction of labor complications and improve
pregnancy outcomes and machine learning are being stud
ied to theoretically optimize a variety of pregnancy outcomes however
only a small proportion of studies that use Al machine learning to
improve pregnancy outcomes have developed CDSSs as an effort to
translate into clinical care
In this paper we comprehensively reviewed existing literature on
CDSSs in the context of pregnancy care that incorporate machine learn
ing techniques We aimed to identify what has been done in this field
and what aspects require attention from future researchers
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows in Section we
describe the structured processes used to conduct this review including
our research questions Section presents what we discovered from
literature in response to the research questions Section discusses the
implications of our findings in Section we conclude this paper
Methods
This systematic literature review was conducted following the struc
tured process used by Antoniadi et al which is adapted from the
guidelines by Kitchenham and Charters The stages of this review
are structured as follows
Specifying the research questions
Conducting searches of specified databases
Selecting studies by criterion
Filtering studies by evaluating their pertinence
Extracting data
Synthesizing results
Research questions
This review aims to answer the following research questions RQs
RQI What studies have been conducted towards the development
of CDSSs that used machine learning in the context of pregnancy care
and what machine learning AI methods were used
Are the machine learning models developed in these studies
explainable
Have the models been developed using data from a specific
population Have these studies explored cultural ethnic racial effects
What CDSSs have been implemented and have they been tested
in clinical practice

Conducting searches
Fig shows the overview of the workflow for the literature search
paper selection and filtering We searched Google Scholar the most
comprehensive academic search engine according to recent studies
We conducted the search on October using the following
search terms Sl and the number of papers returned is shown in
brackets after each search term

A total of non duplicated publications were returned
Paper selection and filtering
We omitted papers other than peer reviewed conference or journal
papers including books book chapters theses dissertations reports
proposals slides abstracts posters pre prints or other archived articles
n We also excluded non English publications n
papers remained after this filtering
We performed a quality check of the remaining papers We only in
cluded papers published in ACM or IEEE journals or journals that were
listed in the Journal Citation Reports JCR https clarivate
com webofsciencegroup tag jcr accessed on October
and conference proceedings published on conferences listed in the
CORE rankings

on October or those published by ACM or IEEE n
excluded Moreover five of the included papers were unavailable on
any platform at our disposal and were thus omitted This reduced the
number of remaining papers to journal papers n confer
ence papers n
We then selected papers based on their relevance to this review
i e papers that described the design or development of CDSS in the
context of pregnancy care using machine learning The first inclusion
criterion was that the paper must mention clinical decision support
system or CDSS machine learning and pregnancy in the title key
word abstract or main text Furthermore if clinical decision support
system or CDSS machine learning and or pregnancy was only men
tioned in the introduction background and or related work section or
as future work only the paper was excluded from this review How
ever we allowed one paper which did not mention machine learning
in appropriate sections but was deemed relevant based on the method
used in the paper The second inclusion criterion was that the paper
must be specific to the context of pregnancy care Papers about CDSSs
in a non pregnancy care specific context such as neonatology and dia
betes mellitus including type type and gestational diabetes were
excluded Note that we included papers when the focus was only on
gestational diabetes In total papers that were out of scope were
excluded Moreover five papers that only use pregnancy related com
plications as a case study example or evaluation dataset were omitted
and marked as case study only
Finally papers were selected and separated into three review
papers and research papers For the purpose of
this review the three literature review papers were moved to a separate
category review papers
Extracting data and synthesis
To ensure the quality of review two independent reviewers read
the research papers thoroughly and extracted useful information
from these papers Any disagreement between reviewers was resolved
by consensus or by a third reviewer

Results
RQI what CDSSs have been developed that used machine learning in
the context of pregnancy care and what machine learning AI methods were
used
There are various studies on or towards the development of machine
learning based CDSSs to assist healthcare delivery at different stages of
pregnancy and different machine learning techniques were used They
are summarised in Table
The studies cover preconception early pregnancy prenatal intra
partum and postpartum stages Most of the studies aimed to support
diagnosis prognosis and treatment in maternal and fetal care during
pregnancy and childbirth and the majority focused on the prenatal
and intrapartum period In addition the majority of studies aimed
to develop CDSSs that are exclusively machine learning based non
knowledge based Only one paper described the development of
CDSS that involves both machine learning techniques and a rule based
knowledge base which makes a hybrid of knowledge based and non
knowledge based system
There has been a growing number of papers published regarding
development of machine learning based CDSSs in the context of preg
nancy care in the last few years as shown in Fig This can be partly
explained by a rise of publications that study cardiotocograms which
may be a result of the availability of two open access cardiotocography
datasets UCI Machine Learning Repository Cardiotocography Data Set
and CTU CHB Intrapartum Cardiotocography Database
Fig shows different machine learning predictive algorithms and
the number of papers that applied them note that machine learning
methods for feature extraction feature selection etc are excluded
Most papers applied supervised learning methods while only one pa
per applied an unsupervised learning algorithm The most widely used
