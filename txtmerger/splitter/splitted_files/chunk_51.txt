According to Davies and Dodd rigor refers to
the reliability and validity of qualitative research how
ever it does not necessitate the sense of replicability of
the research in different situations that is common in
quantitative research In the current study a valid
ation process was performed during and after conduct
ing the interviews using two strategies In the first
method member checking was used in which during
each interview the researcher HB verified the accuracy
of her interpretations with participants by asking further
questions After completion of data analysis interpreta
tions of data were shared by twelve participants who had
previously agreed to review and verify findings of the
study Second the results were confirmed with peer re
view and debriefing through regular meetings with one
of the co investigators MH to achieve a jointly devel
oped interpretation of the data Dependability was
obtained through use of an audit trail In this strategy
contextual information and participant s reflections were
documented The ways to address confirmability in this
study were using direct quotes and confirming the find

their childbearing for a variety of reasons The primary
reason for some women was lifestyle choices n
This group of women described being focused on their
career education or travel or indicated that they did
not feel that they were ready to have children until they
reached an older age Delayed marriage was the primary
reason for six other participants Finally three women
identified infertility issues as their primary reason for
postponed childbearing It should be noted that infertil
ity was also reported among participants in the delayed
marriage and lifestyle choices groups however it was
not their prime reason for delayed childbearing
The findings of this study were categorized into the
following themes definition of pregnancy risk factors
influencing risk perception risk alleviation strategies
and risk communication with health professionals
Definition of pregnancy risk
The first theme describes participants understandings
of pregnancy risk and explains how they defined risk
Most participants acknowledged that pregnancy risk
increases as maternal age rises however a number of
women felt that the risk had been overestimated For
example one of the participants stated that those
numbers don t matter Participant and another
mentioned that it s an overreaction frankly Partici
pant Women s understandings of risks associated
with AMA were reflected most often in comments
about their awareness of increased risk of infertility
issues and genetic abnormalities particularly Down
syndrome Fertility problems associated with delayed
childbearing were an immense concern for most
women rather than pregnancy related issues In this
regard most of the women who delayed marriage
reported that they decided to become pregnant soon
after marriage to minimize the effect of age factor on
their fecundity
It was noted that women considered pregnancy as
more of a societal issue rather than merely a biomedical
matter in which personal interpersonal and societal ele
ments were significant For our participants the mean
ing of risk was broader than medical issues and included
the extent of their support network their ability to con
trol situations and whether they had a secure relation
ship a planned pregnancy a flexible job or healthy
lifestyle and behavior These considerations were also
evident in decisions regarding timing of pregnancy by
participants The following quote is an example of the
broadness of risk definition by one participant with an
uncomplicated pregnancy
A high risk pregnancy to me would have been if I
had no control over my work environment
so
even just the ability to be able to work from home
if I was working in more a violent situation if I
was in a bad relationship I think that would make
me more of a high risk pregnancy than my personal
age or my personal health Participant
In the following quote a year old participant stated
on the importance of having a stable relationship and a
healthy lifestyle
I think you you have to factor in your physical
condition
that you re in good health and
you re taking care of yourself and you re planning
on getting married and you go and get your
physicals
I see a lot of younger girls that are
pregnant and they re drinking bottles of coke and
they re drinking coffee and they re drinking you
know they re eating McDonald s and I m like that
hasn t been my pregnancy you know I ve cut out
sugar and I ve never drank coffee so I don t worry
about that Participant
A year old participant with gestational diabetes and
a moderate perceived risk score commented
I had this this calm calm feeling inside of me that
everything was going to be okay
having a husband
that is loving caring supportive and you know is
my best friend so that really really helps a lot and
having friends you know friends to support to to
help you to talk with you if you have any need and
we have so many people caring about us so um
having a whole community to to be there for you if
you need Participant
Factors influencing risk perception
The magnitude of the perception of pregnancy risk dif
fered among our participants During data analysis nine
factors were identified that influenced women s perception
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
of pregnancy risk including cognitive heuristics of avail
ability and similarity of the risk predictability of the risk
health status pregnancy complications gestational age
perceived control poor fertility history anxiety and the
health care provider s opinion
Cognitive heuristics
Women s understandings of risk were mostly based on
their experiences of real cases and they relied on these
data in assessment of their own pregnancy risk
From my experience in Europe where most women
are having their children in their thirties and not their
twenties and to be honest I didn t and I lived there
for a long time I didn t see the amount of Down s
syndrome or other physical abnormalities that you see
here Participant
Most participants had an example of pregnancy at
AMA among one of their family members friends or
colleagues Availability of a positive example or a favor
able family history of fertility at AMA was often
reported as a reassuring factor that increased women s
perceived ability to conceive at AMA and to have a suc
cessful pregnancy These participants often perceived
their pregnancy as being low risk
I know a lot of women that are having their first
child in their forties
and everything has worked
out fantastic so I always looked at them as sort of my
mentors or role models Participant
Both like my mother had me when she was I
think and my partner s mother had her last one when
she was so it s it doesn t seem that abnormal in
my family And I think maybe that made me
feel less risky as well cause I had you know
generations before me that had late babies and with
no complications Participant
On the other hand women who were familiar with the
risks associated with older maternal age through per
sonal or vicarious experiences expressed more concerns
and perceived a higher risk for their pregnancies One of
the participants with a fairly healthy pregnancy and a
high perception of pregnancy risk score commented
A friend of mine got pregnant I think she was
and she did have a baby who had so many problems
that they were surprised the baby s heart was even still
beating in her womb so she ended up terminating
that pregnancy and she s still broken up about
so
I was debating this So yeah I did have that one
friend and of course the woman who told me about
her near death experience in labor Participant
Page of
Availability of risk is a cognitive heuristic that refers
to a cognitive shortcut used for judging the probability
of an event by the ease with which examples of the event
come to mind p Based on participants expla
nations this concept appeared to be very important in
risk appraisal One participant with a high perception of
pregnancy risk score explained if it risk happens to
other people then it could happen to me
Similarity is another cognitive heuristic and reflects
a cognitive shortcut used for judging the probability of
an event by its similarity to events with comparable fea
tures p Women often assessed their preg
nancy risk by comparing their own characteristics with
those who developed a pregnancy complication The fol
lowing comment from a year old participant is an ex
ample of using the similarity heuristic in risk appraisal
I had that friend who was and had a baby who
had Trisomy and she felt that it was because of
her age
but she is not as healthy as I am She
actually may have an alcohol problem and she s taken
a lot of medications in her life for depression and all
kinds of things and she doesn t really work out very
much and she just wasn t as healthy as I
am Participant
Predictability of the risk
An expected and predictable pregnancy complication
was perceived as a lower risk situation than a non
predicted and unexpected problem One participant with
a low perceived risk score who had severe morning sick
ness in early pregnancy described it as a typical preg
nancy symptom that could happen in every pregnancy
On the other hand another participant with a high per
ception of risk score and a low perceived control score
who had to stop working for an unexpected threatened
premature labor stated
It s been challenging so it s not what I expected
did not expect to feel an almost arthritic pain the last
two months I didn t expect that morning sickness
would be hours a day for five months instead of
three neither of us were expecting this I was
expecting to work until my due date and come to the
hospital and you know I was ready to be like every
other mom well most other moms where you work
till the end and sometimes you just go from work
straight to the hospital in labor Participant
A year old participant with a high perception of
risk score who was diagnosed with gestational diabetes
explained that
Both of my parents have adult onset diabetes and my
mother had gestational diabetes with my brother
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
when she was roughly the same age as me and so I
pretty much expected to have gestational diabetes so
I was careful right from the beginning making sure
that I was exercising and trying to eat healthfully and
so I was cautious about that
however I
so on
was surprised to find that I had needed the insulin for
it as opposed to control by diet that was a bit of a
shock It was a shock to discover that it was that
severe to begin with and that I would need the
insulin Participant
Health status
Most women in our study considered themselves
healthy and felt that they had control over their physical
health Good health was frequently identified as a factor
that would decrease risk when participants assessed
their pregnancy risk in relation to age They often
emphasized their good health as a balancing capacity in
pregnancy risk estimation A year old participant at
weeks of gestation with a low perception of risk
score commented
Because I was I m always I ve always been a quite a
healthy person it it never really concerned me that
much that I was older and having a baby Participant
Pregnancy complications
Among our participants three women had gestational
diabetes one had vaginal bleeding before weeks and
one had both vaginal bleeding before weeks and
threatened preterm labor Based on our findings preg
nancy complications had some influence on the percep
tion of pregnancy risk depending on the type of
complication its impact on the woman s life and the de
gree to which the woman felt that complication had
been controlled For instance the woman with threa
tened preterm labor who had to quit work expressed a
high risk perception On the other hand the other three
women who described their gestational diabetes as a
well controlled situation had low to moderate percep
tion of risk scores The following statement was made by
one of the participants who had a moderate perceived
risk score
I ve developed gestational diabetes in the end but
that s probably due to the fact that I already had
polycystic ovary syndrome so there was already
insulin resistance there was nausea initially but no
vomiting um a lot of weight gain but again that s the
insulin resistance so it s been an easy pregnancy I
suppose Participant
Women with pregnancy complications often had
higher pregnancy related anxiety scores One of the
Page of
participants with gestational diabetes expressed concerns
regarding having a larger baby than average and also
long term consequences of diabetes
The first week after diagnosis I was very very sad I
was very sad because I I was concerned you know
having a big baby and and he has any complication
in the pregnancy um I was very sad for him that I
may be passing this gene Participant
Gestational age
Most participants reported that they felt more relaxed
about risk and developing pregnancy related problems as
their pregnancy progressed The participants described
pregnancy as having several milestones and completing
each phase seemed to increase their confidence in having
a healthy pregnancy
As time went on it got a little bit easier to feel like I
wasn t at as much risk in terms of the pregnancy
Participant
As I get closer to delivery and I haven t had any
problems I m getting more and more confident and I
feel a little bit better Participant
Toward the end of pregnancy the meaning of older
age as a risk factor for most women with uncomplicated
pregnancies remained simply a number Some women
used phrases such as it was just that number and that s
Perceived control
The majority of women in our study perceived them
selves to be prepared to accept child raising responsibil
ities Participants comments reflected that most of them
had a good sense of internal control both over their life
situations and their health Considering the pregnancy
related anxiety and risk perception scores of participants
and their explanations it was evident that women with
high perceived control had lower perceived risk The fol
lowing quote was expressed by a year old participant
who had a high perceived control score and a low per
ception of risk score
I just know the way my body responds to things
I understand my body I m very in tune with how my
body works and I can always tell when something s
not right Participant
Conversely low perceived control was often observed
in conjunction with high perceived risk Sometimes the
woman s religious beliefs changed the equation The fol
lowing statement was made by a year old participant
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
who had both low perceived control and low perceived
risk scores
Both of us felt strongly that
um you know we
believe strongly in God and that he was in control
Participant
Poor fertility history
A number of participants mentioned that they lost a
sense of control over their bodies and their own health
to a great extent after enduring infertility experiences
For some women a history of infertility or miscarriage
led to increased risk perception in pregnancy A year
old woman with a high risk perception score and a his
tory of infertility commented
I planned to get pregnant
and I wasn t able to
like the first thing that came to my mind I m not a
life giver it s not because you wanted to get pregnant
at this month you ll get pregnant I am not in control
If I m not given that then I can t do it s beyond my
powers Participant
The emotional impact of previous fertility issues on
the current pregnancy was expressed by words such as
having worry stress and fear For example a year
old woman with a previous miscarriage who had a high
perception of pregnancy risk score stated
I wasn t at risk first but then after I lost the first baby
I thought well maybe this is because I m old I was
stressed I didn t really deal with it Participant
A year old participant believed that infertility treat
ments had a negative impact on her physical health This
belief was also tracked in other participants explanations
with infertility experiences
I think what plays into how I perceive my pregnancy
is is not just my age it s the journey I took to get
here it was because it took four years to get here
and it was a hard four years My body wasn t at risk
I wasn t when we first started trying I was extremely
healthy and in shape and and felt ready and then as I
went through all the fertility procedures my health it
affected my health and I didn t feel myself I didn t
feel as strong as I was so coming into a pregnancy
now where I was coming off of all that fertility stuff it
made me feel like I might be at a higher risk
Participant
Anxiety
Although most participants in this study expressed some
degree of concern for the health and well being of their
babies only a few women were very anxious
Page of
Nevertheless we found that these women often did not
use anxiety as a term to describe their anxious feelings
For instance the following quote comes from a year
old participant who had a high anxiety score
There still is a little bit in the back of my mind once
the baby is born
is the baby going to is everything
going to be okay with the baby and through delivery
and through labor So there is a little bit not anxiety
I wouldn t say anxiety but a little bit of concern
Participant
Being emotional was another term that a year old
participant with a high anxiety score and moderate per
ception of risk score used to express her feelings
I m a little bit emotional I think that s my biggest
been my biggest struggle throughout the entire
pregnancy is my emotional state First with being so
worried and then hormones I wasn t I was depressed
and now I m having trouble sleeping which is causing
a lot of frustration and I m really uncomfortable
Participant
According to participants explanations waiting for
screening results bed rest and limiting physical activities
due to pregnancy complications e g morning sickness
contributed to their risk perception One participant
with a high perceived risk score and a high anxiety score
who experienced morning sickness in early pregnancy
explained
I didn t feel very good for many months so I couldn t
eat I was barfing a lot so that probably added to my
stress being home all day cause I couldn t work and
not being able to eat so that always you know
increases your stress and it lowers your resistance
too Participant
Feeling that this pregnancy might be their last chance
to have a biological child might increase anxiety for
these women and add to the dilemma A year old
participant with a complicated pregnancy who had a
high perception of risk score and a low perceived control
score explained
High risk mostly is or my perception of high risk is
if something happened to myself or my child this
may be my only chance to be pregnant and deliver a
child Participant
Health care providers opinion
Health care providers perspectives about risk and their
reaction to and interpretation of risk had a considerable
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
influence on the women s understandings and assess
ments of their own risk Participants explanations
revealed that health care providers opinions as experts
in risk assessment were viewed as very valuable and re
lied upon by women Although care providers do not
usually disclose their personal opinion women may in
tuit it by observing care providers reactions and body
language Women may include this information in deter
mining of their risk levels especially if there is an uncer
tainty associated with the level of vulnerability As a
year old participant with a low perception of risk
score and a low anxiety score remarked
My family doctor called me to tell me that the baby
has to have an ultrasound after a month but the
doctor here doesn t seem doesn t seem bothered by it
so I don t think it s got anything to do with the baby
having like mental or physical disability of any sorts
I think it s just more just something for them to look
at Participant
Taking into consideration that several participants in
this study reported that they did not have major discus
sions with their health care providers about risks asso
ciated with AMA it might give these women a degree of
confidence that there are no serious concerns
Risk alleviation strategies
Several strategies were reported by the participants to
help them alleviate and or cope with their pregnancy
risk This process for our participants involved edu
cating themselves and engaging in a healthy lifestyle
undertaking reassuring surveillance tests overlooking
the risk relying on religious beliefs and hope and bal
ancing their risk by emphasis on the positive social
aspects of AMA
Educating themselves and engaging in a healthy lifestyle
Some participants spoke of gathering information to
know what actual risks are and to be prepared Partici
pants with low perceived risk scores and high or moder
ate perceived control scores often reported that they had
prepared themselves for pregnancy complications to
not be surprised by risk Participant This year
old participant with a high perceived control score who
perceived a low risk for her pregnancy stated
I m healthy I m fine and I ve prepared myself I ve
educated myself Yeah I think it would be less
stressful if I were younger because I wouldn t have
to educate myself so much I would have educated
myself but I feel like I had to do that extra little bit of
research because I was in that high risk group I was
in that you know more chance of something going
Page of
wrong group So I educated myself a little bit more
Participant
These participants were also focused on improving
their lifestyle and engaging in healthy behaviors to pro
tect their pregnancies
Reassuring surveillance tests
Because most women were aware of the association be
tween genetic problems and older maternal age receiv
ing reassuring screening test results was reported as a
relieving factor A desire to seek actual and tangible
signs of the baby s health to confirm that it s a normal
baby was evident in the interviews
When I had one ultrasound and I saw that
everything was okay he was developing okay then I
had the tests done the blood test I said okay he s a
normal baby so I stopped worrying Participant
Some participants chose to take screening tests as part
of their preparation to deal with anticipatory issues and
to decrease concerns related to fetal health Based on
several participants explanations undertaking screening
tests was a reflection of their desire to plan and be
prepared
We just wanted to do it for our own sake of mind
just for our own peace of mind I like planning my
life I like preparing for things I like being educated
and ready for whatever I wanted to know if I m going
to have a baby with Down s syndrome I want to know
so that I m prepared so that I can educate myself as
to what this baby s needs are going to be At least if
you ve prepared a little bit you might be able to
handle it differently Participant
Overlooking ignoring the risk
Some participants reported an inclination to disregard
the risk to avoid excessive stress and anxiety In fact
overlooking the risk was a very common approach
among our participants even among those who edu
cated themselves and were engaged in a healthy lifestyle
I ve been trying not to let research or other reports
or what I read influence my way of thinking
know they exist I m not saying that ignorance is bliss
but I just don t focus on it Participant
The following quote from a year old participant
who had both a low perceived risk score and a low per
ceived control score describes this approach She and
her partner decided not to undergo genetic screening
tests
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
I did a fair bit of reading but then at the same time I
also got to a point where when I was pregnant I put
the reading aside because I just found it was
starting to increase a lot of anxiety about all the
things that could go wrong or be wrong
considering my age and considering the risks
didn t want to go into the constant anxiety about it
we didn t want to be ignorant about it like we we did
all our research and awareness uh like I said we
made sure we were eating healthy but I mean other
than that there s not much else you can do you
can t it s out of our control
once we talked
Page of
I would say right now I was not emotionally prepared
at that time to have a baby
I was not strong a
strong woman that I m right now I have much more
to offer my son now than if I was young
Participant
I do think that I would probably have more energy
ten years ago but at the same time emotionally I
wasn t ready I was immature and irresponsible still
ten years ago Now I m more mature and more
emotionally ready for it Participant
Communication with health professionals

of our hands Participant
cases there was not a discussion about other age related
risks On the other hand most women preferred not to
Religious beliefs and hope
initiate risk communication They reported receiving
Religious beliefs and hope were other alleviating factors
extra information about risk associated with older age as
described by some participants They reported that these
pointless and most likely stressful and anxiety provoking
beliefs helped them to stay calm and feel that they were
because they knew they would not be able to change
not alone A woman with a high perceived risk score
their risk factor age
and a low anxiety score commented that
I was aware and I knew and he was extremely open
I think my my faith in in God somehow kind of like
to questions he s very approachable so I knew that if
helps me go to sleep at night you know like I mean I
I had concerns or if I had questions about it I could
Participant
pray
talk to him but I didn t feel the need Participant
Another participant with a high perceived risk score
Some women reported having negative communica
and a moderate anxiety score expressed that her reli
tion with health professionals as reflected by the follow
gious beliefs were important in how she dealt with the
ing quote from a year old participant with a low risk
risk This participant had a low perceived control score
pregnancy
and decided not to undergo genetic screening tests
I think that s a matter of our faith and our belief um
that you know I mean if God created this child if
God chooses to take this child then that s his decision
to make and not ours so we re not playing God by
taking that child s life Participant
Emphasis on positive social aspects of AMA
A tendency to emphasize positive aspects of pregnancy
at older age emerged during the interviews From some
of our participants perspectives an older age improved
their readiness to be a parent by having an established
Um the lady that gave me the ultrasound I think she
was judging me a bit for being older cause she did
ask me you know if I had taken all the extra screening
and I told her no and I don t think she was too
impressed by that and then
she s like I think
people that have babies when they re really old that s
just unethical
and so I definitely got from her that
uh you know she was judging me a bit for being older
Participant
Some participants found risk discussions with their
health care provider stressful In reviewing participants
relationship and career being mature both emotionally
statements and their anxiety scores it was apparent that
and personally and developing problem solving skills
anxiety may influence the way a pregnant woman inter
through having various life experiences Our participants
preted risk information and the contents of risk commu
weighed these advantages against biomedical risk in their

risk assessment The following quotes are from partici
pants who had moderate perceived risk scores
There s a risk and it s high risk But if if you ask me
if I would prefer being pregnant at this age or at
participant who had both a high anxiety score and a high
perceived risk score
I was scared after talking to the genetic counselor for
sure The nurse with my GP always mentioned it
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
every visit she would say well you do have high risks
because of your age Every week I know my age you
don t have to keep driving the point home Cause I
had a lot of fear actually when I was meeting with the
genetic counselor and with the nurse at my family
doctor s office I was strongly encouraged to go for
genetic counseling because of my advanced age The
terminology that the doctors and nurses and
everybody used advanced age advanced age I m not
eighty but okay I suppose I m over And they
would show me charts like oh this is how your risk
increases once you ve reached and you kind of feel
a fear that you know something s going to go wrong
cause you re over And the genetic counselor drew
all these charts and showed me my risk But after the
genetic counseling and the results came back from all
the tests it turns out I have an extremely low risk so
I m not sure why they try to scare you like that
Participant
Discussion
The definition of risk for women of AMA similar to
that of pregnant women of other ages had a
broader scope than merely medical risks or physical
challenges and was influenced by various social and per
sonal characteristics The findings described above eluci
dated that this definition also incorporates consideration
of the extent of the woman s support network her ability
to control situations and whether she had an established
relationship a planned pregnancy a flexible job or
healthy lifestyle and behavior These findings support
the position that approaches to understanding percep
tion of health risks should be comprehensive and broad
and suggest that risk communication will benefit
from including women s criteria for defining risk
As is the case in previous research pregnancy at
AMA was frequently acknowledged by women to be
high risk due to an increased risk of genetic abnormal
ities however other medical risks associated with AMA
received less consideration In our study the informa
tion quests in which women sought out a wide
range of information were commonly reported in the
preconception period After becoming pregnant how
ever women mostly limited seeking information to avoid
increased anxiety and were focused on risk reducing be
havior instead In contrast to findings of Carolan Nel
son who reported that their Australian
participants realized they were at higher risk only after
becoming pregnant and through communication with
their health care providers women in our study
described risks associated with AMA as common know
ledge in society This finding is consistent with the find
ing of another Canadian study
Page of
Findings elucidated that nulliparous women aged
years or older were not a homogenous group in their
pregnancy risk assessment The data described above
suggest that the perception of pregnancy risk may be a
result of interactions among several factors including
physiological and psychological elements characteristics
of the experienced risk and feedback from health care
providers Despite the fact that our respondents were
mostly aware of risks associated with pregnancy at age
years or older the majority of them did not consider
themselves to be high risk This apparent disconnect can
be explained by the fact that people typically tend to rate
their personal risk lower in comparison to general risk
This underestimation of personal risk or unrealis
tic optimism might be related to one s perceived
control over a potential risk A link has been identi
fied between perceived control and risk perception in
previous research In our study those participants
who believed they had good control over their physical
health also perceived a lower risk for their pregnancy It
was also noted that a woman s perceived control over
her health may be important in engaging in various
behaviors to maintain the balance between risk and
health To support this point a relationship between
perceived control and health service utilization has been
documented in previous research
Previous prenatal loss was recently documented as a
predictor of depression and anxiety in subsequent preg
nancies independent of other psychosocial and obstetric
factors Our findings highlighted that having a poor
reproductive history contributes to increased perceived
risk of pregnancy Failure to become pregnant in initial
attempts or previous loss of pregnancy may have threa
tened these women s beliefs in their abilities to manage
their own health and may lead to increased anxiety and
higher risk perception This statement is supported by
Campbell Dunkel Schetter Peplau who
reported that infertility may be perceived as a threat to
an infertile person s life s goals contributing to a low
perception of control Based on our data pregnancy
complications could alter risk perception depending on
the type of complication its manageability and its con
sequences for a woman s daily life Alternatively good
physical health and engaging in healthy behaviors and
lifestyles were perceived as risk alleviating factors This
finding echoes that of Gerend et al who reported
that personal health actions from the women s perspec
tives can reduce their risk
Concerns about fetal health and well being particu
larly genetic abnormalities were very common among
our participants as they have been found to be in other
studies Although having several fetal sur
veillance tests helped reassure women about their baby s
health as Baillie et al have noted for a number
Bayrampour et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
http www biomedcentral com
of women feelings of anxiety may remain throughout
the pregnancy Hoping for a desirable pregnancy
outcome despite having higher perceived risk and anx
iety levels was evident in our data This discrepancy may
lead to feelings of uncertainty Sun et al in a
qualitative study of women of AMA reported similar
ambivalent and conflicted feelings characterized by ap
parent pleasure and hidden fear This attitude has
been referred as a jubilant apprehension by Yuan et al
that describes feelings of great joy and satisfac
tion but also worry about childbirth outcomes
Feelings of anxiety were described vaguely by our par
ticipants and there were notable variations among parti
cipants in expressing and wording their anxiety This
attitude may make the detection of anxiety in these
women a challenge There is evidence that antenatal
anxiety is very prevalent and can increase the odds of
postnatal depression Therefore identification of
women with anxiety is crucial so that effective interven
tions can be targeted appropriately Healthcare providers
should be aware that some women with high levels of
anxiety tend to use different terms to communicate
these feelings Although creating a relaxed environment
and establishing a non judgmental communication pat
tern in prenatal care visits may be beneficial for anxious
women in disclosing their actual feelings about potential
risks there is growing evidence suggesting that prenatal
screening should also include screening for both depres
Sion and anxiety We support this perspective
and believe that using a reliable screening tool to assess
anxiety in pregnant women may be useful to identify
women who would benefit from strategies to reduce
anxiety A recent study in Australia demonstrated that
the anxiety subscale of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depres
Sion Scale might be a reliable measure to screen ante
natal anxiety
Women experienced a decrease in their perceived risk
with advancing gestational weeks which could be due to
women becoming adapted to the state of being pregnant
or becoming more positive about the outcome of their
pregnancy as it advanced An uncomplicated pregnancy
and favorable screening results may contribute to
decreased perception of risk over the course of preg
nancy as well A decline in worry about the baby s health
from early pregnancy to the postpartum period has been
reported in previous research
Consistent with research in other fields our results
demonstrated that pregnant women s personal or vicari
ous experience with a risk may increase the psycho
logical availability of the risk and consequently its
perceived probability In fact being familiar with
risk through researching information or indirect experi
ences may contribute to women s risk perception In the
literature the perceived characteristics of the risk such
Page of
as prevalence controllability preventability and serious
ness along with the availability and representativeness
heuristics are important elements in constructing risk
perception Our findings point to the predictabil
ity of risk as a critical characteristic of risk in which pre
dicting the risk and expecting it influenced participants
risk perception A risk that is expected may be perceived
as less risky than an unexpected risk suggesting that
clear communication is essential to help women have
realistic expectations about their individual risk A quali
tative study by Patterson demonstrated that an
unexpected shift in health situation or pregnancy out
comes was identified as a high risk condition by pregnant
women while the expected changes were considered as
no risk One explanation is that anticipating the risk
and being prepared to deal with it may increase a
woman s perceived control and consequently decrease
her risk perception
While discrepancies between pregnant women s and
health care providers appraisals of risk have been docu
mented in previous research what appears to be
less emphasized is the influence of health care providers
attitudes towards the risk on pregnant women s risk per
ception Several women in this study reported not hav
ing any risk communication with their health care
providers that focused on age as a risk factor This has
been interpreted by most participants as there not being
any serious concern and may imply that pregnant
women trust their health care provider s opinion In this
regard Heaman et al reported that women with
or without pregnancy complications rely on their health
care providers in assessing risk status A few participants
reported negative risk communication with their health
care providers These participants also had higher anx
iety and concern about the well being of their fetus and
pregnancy outcomes Whether risk communication pat
terns can increase the anxiety or whether anxiety itself
will alter women s interpretation of risk communication
is not clear and needs further research In literature a
link between maternal depression and higher perception
of teratogenic risk has been reported
Implications
In the experience of our participants any emphasis on
the mother s good health by their care providers was
described as reassuring Conversely negative messages
about age by purely emphasizing pregnancy risks asso
ciated with AMA were described as very destructive and
challenging particularly for women with high levels of
anxiety These findings indicate that although offering
risk information is part of the risk communication
process the woman s mental health should be consid
ered to avoid unnecessary stress

Comparison was a common risk appraisal strategy
among our participants However women s evaluations
were distinct from those of health professionals in that
the participants often compared their risk to a known
population such as their family members friends or
stories from real people which is entirely different from
risks determined by epidemiological studies using popu
lation data This disjuncture stems at least in part from
the fact that pregnant women s understanding of risk is
mostly based on their life experiences suggesting
that real stories can alter risk perception This finding
has important implications for practice and public health
education Risk must be tangible in order to be recog
nized and potentially addressed by women Interventions
to decrease unhealthy behaviors should target this con
cept to alter risk perception As Williamson Weyman
suggested when individuals have less experience
or knowledge of risks the media e g documentary
movies can play an important role in increasing their
understanding of those risks
One of the strengths of the study was the addition of
quantitative measures i e perception of pregnancy risk
anxiety and perceived control and the inclusion of a
variety of perspectives from women of AMA with vary
ing levels of risk perception anxiety and perceived con
trol This diversity in the sample allowed for the
documentation of variations in risk appraisal and also
the identification of important issues that were common
across participants Another major strength was the con
temporaneous exploration of risk perception during the
pregnancy It is important to consider the following lim
itations when interpreting and applying the results First
our sample was representative of a middle class and
married population these characteristics may limit the
generalization of the results This is a small study based
on interviews in one geographical area in Canada
therefore the results may not be generalizable to other
populations Finally we recognize that selection bias
may have been introduced as a purposeful sampling
method was employed and those who volunteered to
participate might have been different from those who
did not
Conclusion
Pregnancy at age years or older within a healthy con
text and in the absence of other risk factors was per
ceived as a low risk pregnancy by the majority of our
participants However in the presence of risk factors
such as pregnancy complications limited physical activ
ity unfavorable screening tests results previous poor re
productive history and anxiety the risk associated with
age was highlighted and women were inclined to
recognize their age as a risk factor for their pregnancy
This study adds to the literature on perception of
Page of
pregnancy risk by identifying several factors that influ
ence the perception of pregnancy risk Understanding of
these influential factors may help health care providers
who care for pregnant women aged years or older to
gain insight into their perspectives on pregnancy risk
and improve the effectiveness of risk communication
