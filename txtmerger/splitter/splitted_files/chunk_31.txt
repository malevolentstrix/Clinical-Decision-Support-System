health Although pre existing medical conditions eg
chronic anaemia chronic hypertension diabetes are a
growing concern direct obstetric complications such as
postpartum haemorrhage pre eclampsia and infection
remain the leading biomedical causes of maternal
mortality The necessary technologies commodities and
services to effectively reduce maternal mortality already
exist Mortality could be substantially reduced if quality
assured maternal health commodities and services were
consistently available and if unwanted pregnancies were
prevented in the first place by increasing access to modern
contraception
However an exclusive focus on maternal mortality
could be restrictive because surviving pregnancy is no
longer suffcient to achieve the global targets related to
maternal health Beyond survival the focus in
maternal health is evolving towards promoting health
and wellbeing across the life course This expanded focus
requires a holistic and integrative approach centred on a
positive experience of care The integrative efforts
towards the SDGs are intentionally designed to converge
and align with this broader vision for maternal health a
world in which all women have the highest possible level
of health and wellbeing during pregnancy and beyond
Therefore a rapid acceleration of global efforts to
improve maternal health is required if the SDG targets
are to be met by and the promise ofa better world
for all is to be realised
For this first paper in the Series on maternal health in
the perinatal period and beyond we conducted a
systematic analysis of the determinants of maternal
health and factors associated with maternal mortality and
examined the relationship between these determinants
and the gradual shift over time from a pattern of high
maternal mortality to a pattern of low maternal mortality
a phenomenon described as the obstetric transition or
maternal mortality transition The appendix presents
the methods used in this analysis together with additional
information Our aim was to provide a broad overarching
conceptualisation of distal and proximal determinants
that shape maternal health outcomes to enable an
informed reflection on the appropriate strategies to
accelerate countries transition from high to low maternal
mortality burden stages We hope this paper together
with the other papers in the Series on vulnerability during
pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum period
neglected medium term and long term complications
following labour and childbirth and an intersectional
approach to address maternal health
highlights often overlooked yet crucial pathways to
accelerate progress to end preventable maternal deaths
and improve maternal health and wellbeing In this
paper the terms woman and women are used to
reflect all populations with the reproductive capacity for
pregnancy and birth including transgender and gender
diverse people as well as adolescent girls
Maternal health as the product of a
multifactorial process
We reviewed the literature for conceptual frameworks of
the determinants of maternal health appendix p We
identified frameworks portraying maternal health and
wellbeing as the result ofa multifactorial process appendix
p The core themes or elements commonly found in the
included frameworks are summarised in the figure This
figure presents a high level illustration of a health
production process in which eco social forces ie elements
of the superdeterminants and social determinants
described in the next section and contexts as well as
individual level factors and lifestyle patterns substantially
contribute to maternal health and wellbeing The panel
lists the core themes we identified informed by our
multisource literature review it maps the factors associated
with maternal mortality and severe morbidity appendix
p In the following sections we use the factors identified
from this literature review to further describe and elaborate
on the connections and interdependencies of the key
forces illustrated in the figure
Superdeterminants and social determinants of
maternal health
The superdeterminants of maternal health are the
underlying contexts and forces that broadly influence
the health and wellbeing of women before during
and after pregnancy These mutually interacting
superdeterminants include the characteristics of the
biosphere eg climate ecosystem biological features of
the human species eg the endocrinology of human
wwvv thelancet com lancetgh Vol February
parturition and the anatomy of the female pelvis and
the economic political and cultural bases of societies
eg health insurance policies and health budgetary
allocations health care policies and legislations on
reproductive rights and access to care societal norms
and expectations related to gender roles and cultural
beliefs surrounding pregnancy and childbirth The
evolution of modern humans Homo sapiens has largely
been shaped by the characteristics of the environment
This evolution is an ongoing process driven by natural
selection and other mechanisms in which traits and
characteristics that offer advantages for survival and
reproduction become sustained in populations over
time Characteristics such as the shape of the female
pelvis and the complex endocrinology of human
parturition which underlie the biological and
physiological bases of pregnancy labour and childbirth
are responsible for reproductive success as well as
challenges that persist across generations Adaptation
to different environmental challenges over time
encouraged the development of social structures and
cooperative behaviours culminating in a diverse range of
cultural practices social norms political structures and
economies across different contexts As the dominant
species on the planet the activities of humans over time
such as deforestation industrialisation and pollution
have had profound effects on the environment These
behaviours have led to disruptions in ecosystems loss of
biodiversity escalating and more frequent climate events
such as heat waves droughts and floods and the
emergence of new health threats including zoonotic
diseases eg COVID all with detrimental effects on
maternal survival and wellbeing Although applicable
to other health areas the combination of intrinsic
biological and behavioural characteristics of human
beings the manifestations of human interactions with
the environment and society s cultural political and
economic adaptations are superdeterminants with
substantial effects on maternal and perinatal health
The social determinants of health are derived from
economic political and cultural superdeterminants and
are defined as the non biomedical factors that influence
health risks and outcomes throughout life With regard
to maternal health social determinants of health are the
conditions in which women are born grow work and live
before pregnancy and during pregnancy childbirth and
the postpartum period These social determinants
substantially affect maternal health outcomes and are
indirectly responsible for the disparities observed in
maternal mortality and morbidity rates between different
populations The list of social determinants of maternal
health in the literature is extensive but the importance
of structural biases related to gender ethnicity and
socioeconomic class cannot be overemphasised
Gender disparities income education ethnicity and
race are strong predictors of death and disability

Figure Maternal health production process
The diagram illustrates the relationships and interdependencies of
superdeterminants showing how the characteristics of the planet shape biological
and physiological evolution of reproduction in human species Homo sapiens and
how continual adaptations of humans to the planet culminate into cultural
practices social norms and political and economic systems that influence the
contexts in which pregnancy and childbirth takes place social determinants as
well as the individual level traits lifestyle patterns and exposures to external
agents The resultant effect of these forces on maternal health and wellbeing
depends on the efficiency of the health system at neutralising detrimental forces
and enhancing beneficial ones In this representation exposures and lifestyles are
influenced both by individual factors and social determinants The performance of
the health system is also dependent on superdeterminants and influenced by
individual level factors and social determinants
beyond Discrimination systemic bias and social
injustice are frequently associated with poor maternal
outcomes for racial and ethnic minority women for
instance a health care system that routinely minimises
the pain reported by Black women is more likely to miss
warning signs for severe morbidity Apart from the
direct effects of exposure to conflicts and other forms
of violence on pregnant women conflict induced
displacement and forced migration are recognised
disruptors of health care systems and infrastructure
restricting access to life saving maternal health services
and causing severe psychological stress and trauma for
pregnant and postnatal women Women who are
migrants and pregnant have to navigate several barriers to
access care in host countries such as language immigrant
status and unfamiliarity with health care systems

accidents resulting in physical trauma and injuries have
varying degrees of detrimental effects on maternal
health outcomes depending on a woman s unique
circumstances and level of exposures Violence against
women deserves special mention although violence is
often more visible in conflict affected areas the effects
on pregnancy outcomes are equally devastating even in
non conflict areas particularly when perpetrated by an
intimate partner As a result of the influence of
superdeterminants of maternal health particularly
cultural political and economic systems individual
level factors that are shaped by family and community
characteristics tend to give rise to lifestyle patterns
which in turn mitigate or elevate the risk of dying or
having pregnancy related ill health Examples of
lifestyle patterns with substantial effects on maternal
health include diet eg low iron and low calcium intakes
increase the risk of iron deficiency anaemia and pre
eclampsia respectively physical activity substance use
and smoking and sexual behaviours during pregnancy

Interplay between maternal health determinants and
the concept of embodi ment
The pregnant woman is at the centre of a dynamic
and multifaceted web of interactions between
superdeterminants
social determinants and her
individual level factors exposures and lifestyle pattern
These determinants operate at several levels and are
interconnected and inter related with each factor
continuously influencing and being influenced by others
leading to a resultant effect that collectively shapes
maternal health outcomes throughout pregnancy
childbirth and the postpartum period For example the
climate and environment in which pregnant women live
can affect their health both directly by modifying their
individual level factors and exposures and indirectly by
disrupting their social support structures and health
systems Extreme weather events poor air and water
quality and exposure to pollutants can directly or indirectly
influence maternal health outcomes Cultural norms
surrounding pregnancy and childbirth shape maternal
health behaviours and health care seeking practices by
acting as modifiers of individual level factors such as age
to start a family number of children to have and to what
extent the partner is involved in care of the woman
Cultural factors also influence decisions on nutrition
antenatal care practices and childbirth practices Societal
expectations and gender roles can affect pregnant women s
autonomy access to education resources and health care
and influence their decision making power within their
households as well as their ability to make decisions about
their own health where they work and what they do
Lifestyle patterns arising from social determinants can
influence individual level factors by initiating or
exacerbating pre existing conditions that have serious
effects on maternal health For example low income
status can result in poor nutritional intake or unhealthy
dietary practices and consequently increased risks of
pre pregnancy deficiency anaemia or maternal obesity
Maternal obesity can increase the risk of gestational
diabetes and an unhealthy diet during pregnancy can
contribute to excessive maternal weight gain leading to
various complications including gestational diabetes
Similarly unresolved anaemia during pregnancy has
detrimental effects on the growing fetus and predisposes
the pregnant woman to adverse outcomes including
postpartum haemorrhage and death
Lifestyle pattern and the health care system can also
affect the interaction of factors and converge as a net
force that influences overall maternal outcomes However
lifestyles and the configuration ofa health system are also
products of the prevailing context and social forces the
capacity and resilience of a health system reflect the state
of social development Intersections between factors
particularly gender ethnicity and socioeconomic class
www thelancet com lancetgh Vol February
Series
are highly relevant in determining inequities in income
affecting the quality of care a woman can access
education affecting how informed a woman is about her
choices during pregnancy and childbirth and personal
agency affecting how able a woman is to advocate for
her needs
Thus this complex interplay of forces might produce
concrete events that substantially disrupt maternal
physical and mental health For example take a woman
born and raised in poverty with little access to education
income good nutrition and family planning methods
At an older age as a multiparous pregnant woman with
nutritional anaemia she faces severe bleeding after
giving birth to a stillborn baby Despite the use of
uterotonics she only survives a postpartum haemorrhage
event due to an emergency hysterectomy However she
sustains prolonged disability related to severe maternal
morbidity in addition to the grief of losing a child her
family is forced further into poverty by the large out of
pocket expenses for the complications she experienced
Thus the whole process can be understood as a process
of embodiment in which women internalise and embed
into their bodies and minds the interactions between
their being and the surrounding context and external and
internal forces That is the pregnant woman embodies
the intersections of complex multidimensional forces
Embodiment in the context of maternal health refers to
the integration of the physical social psychological and
cultural aspects of a woman s lived experiences and how
these factors collectively influence her health and
wellbeing throughout the pregnancy journey and beyond
The concept of embodiment recognises that maternal
health is not solely determined by biomedical factors that
underlie pregnancy events but is deeply shaped by the
broader context in which pregnancy occurs
Specific factors associated with maternal mortality and
morbidity ie direct and indirect causes of mortality and
morbidity represent concrete expressions of the context
and the forces described earlier which might progress
with additional complications and organ dysfunctions
the final common pathway to maternal mortality panel
Suicide femicide and other external causes of death
during pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum period
might follow a distinct and similarly complex path but
also represent the embodiment of the interplay between
underlying social forces eg the patriarchy and other
gender social norms and individual family and
community factors This complexity highlights the
reduced agency many women still experience in their
maternal health trajectory a constraint that is often
observed in low income settings
The various individual level factors lifestyles social
forces and their intersections affect the emergence of
biomedical and other factors that ultimately determine
maternal survival and wellbeing during a woman s
pregnancy journey The resultant effect of all these forces
is dependent on how effcient the health system is at
Series
neutralising any detrimental forces and enhancing those
that are beneficial
The role of the health system in maternal health
The health system plays a crucial role in shaping the
embodiment of the inter related forces and contexts
presented earlier Health services and commodities eg
quality assured uterotonics to reduce postpartum blood
loss in a woman who presents with anaemia at the time
of birth can modify the effects of eco social forces that
lead to adverse maternal health outcomes Therefore the
health system can be considered a decisive protective
factor able to neutralise or minimise the effects of
detrimental risk factors Accordingly the negative effects
of some risk factors such as advanced maternal age or
low income status can be attenuated by well functioning
health services particularly those with high quality
preconception antenatal intrapartum and postpartum
care
In this context quality of care emerges as a central
attribute of health services that can exert a protective
effect on maternal health Quality is a multidimensional
concept translated into maternity services as the interplay
of available human resources infrastructure com
modities and effcient processes producing a positive
care experience for the woman and favourable health
outcomes at an acceptable cost However and often due
to poor quality of care health services might not be able
to modify or counterbalance adverse social determinants
individual level factors lifestyles and exposures The
default health system configuration in many low resource
settings features inadequate or suboptimal equipment for
screening and diagnosis health care worker shortages or
competency challenges inadequate use of effective
maternal health interventions or a combination of these
problems which together coalesce into the so called too
little too late situation ll Preventable deaths continue if
the chain of events leading to maternal mortality is not
interrupted For instance pre eclampsia is easy and
inexpensive to diagnose and potentially preventable with
health care commodities eg aspirin however the
underdiagnosis of pre eclampsia and underuse of
preventive measures continue to drive pre eclampsia
related mortality and morbidity in low resource settings
Furthermore health services can be influenced by social
forces For example disrespect abuse and mistreatment
of women within maternity services often reflect gender
ethnic or social class biases against women and are
perpetrated by health care providers many of whom are
women and themselves affected by the same forces and
hierarchies within the health services
Although health systems have the potential to attenuate
adverse health factors they can also cause hazards
Complications of health interventions ie iatrogenic
factors are an important contributor to all cause
mortality and a substantial cause Ofor contributing factor
to maternal mortality Health interventions are
designed and implemented to improve situations in
which the anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks
For example a medically indicated caesarean section can
be a life saving intervention and the underuse of
caesarean section is associated with poor maternal and
perinatal health outcomes However when health
interventions are implemented in situations with
relatively low risk of adverse outcomes their benefits
might not outweigh their risks and indeed could lead to
harm The same intervention applied to a situation with
a lower risk of adverse outcomes might have a different
result For example the short term and long term
complications of a non medically indicated caesarean
section outweigh the potential benefits for both the
woman and the baby Ensuring rational use of caesarean
sections is of great importance especially in settings
without reliable access to safe surgery Promoting the
rational use of health interventions and preventing
interventions that are not medically justified ie
quaternary prevention nor desired by the informed care
recipient can be a strong complement to quality of care
good health outcomes and a positive care experience
In addition using non medically indicated health
interventions can be a substantial resource drain for
both society and the individual that could further
complicate subsequent pregnancies especially in
resource constrained settings
Maternal health determinants and transitions in
maternal mortality
Despite the substantial number of maternal deaths every
year there is a slow but steady trend towards maternal
mortality reduction This trend means that over an
extended time period the absolute number of maternal
deaths and the global MMR are gradually reducing The
first worldwide estimates in the and early
indicated nearly maternal deaths per year Three
decades later the world has almost halved that incidence
there were an estimated maternal deaths in
Countries with reliable maternal mortality data
since the mid or earlier also show similar trends
Building on demographic
epidemiological and
nutritional transitions a transition model to describe
the gradual shift from a pattern of high maternal
mortality to a pattern of low maternal mortality at the
country level was developed by Souza and colleagues
Based on the notion that maternal health is the product
of a multifactorial process as described earlier this
transition model relates levels of maternal mortality to
social development reproductive health indicators
biomedical causes of maternal mortality and the
organisation and quality of health care The central
hypothesis of this transition model is that social
development offers protection from or mitigation of the
detrimental effects of distal and proximal determinants
producing a trend towards maternal mortality reduction
In other words as social development advances maternal
wwvv thelancet com lancetgh Vol February
mortality tends to decrease The maternal mortality
transition stage of a country could therefore be
conceptualised as the net result of the dynamic balance
between the predominant forces of determinants and the
advancements in social development to counteract these
forces
Although the mortality transition model describes a
continuous process stages within the model are used to
identify patterns associated with the level of maternal
mortality in various countries To propose the stages of
the transition model we adopted the MMR cutoffs used
in the WHO UNICEF UNFPA and the World Bank
report on trends in maternal mortality from to
Stage was proposed as a very high maternal
mortality stage MMR maternal deaths per
livebirths stage represents high maternal
mortality MMR stage represents inter
mediate maternal mortality MMR and stage

MMR IOO A theoretical stage in which hypothetically
all preventable maternal deaths have been prevented is
also included The MMR cutoff for stage is diffcult to
determine but one could hypothesise it to be less than
one maternal death per livebirths since maternal
mortality enquiries in countries with low and very low
maternal mortality ie those in stage and continue
to show potential preventability of maternal deaths The

climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are prevalent Violence conflicts internal displacements and political instability are
common The economy is weak and not resilient to external forces Gender discrimination structural
bias and poor social development are common The health system is weak and can be influenced by the
effects of social forces allowing embodiment of overwhelming biomedical factors underlying maternal
death and morbidity
Environmental and climate effects are moderate to serious with some environmental protection and
few climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are less prevalent than stage Violence conflicts internal displacements and political
instability are less common than stage The economy is more stable and resistant to external forces
compared with stage Effects of gender discrimination and structural bias are increasingly addressed by
social development programmes The health system is stronger and less permeable to the effects of
social forces compared with previous stages however the health system struggles with care for women
with obstetric emergencies pre existing risk factors and exposures to external agents associated with
maternal death and morbidity
Environmental and climate effects are moderate with several environmental protection and some
climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are rare Violence conflicts internal displacements and political instability are rare
The economy is strong and fairly resistant to external forces Gender discrimination and structural bias
are addressed by social development programmes but gaps persist Health system is stronger and more
resistant to the effects of social forces compared with previous stages
Environmental and climate effects are minimal with robust environmental protection and climate
adaptation and mitigation activities in place Cultural practices that are unfavourable to maternal health
are non existent Violence conflicts internal displacements or political instability are practically
non existent The economy is very strong robust and resilient to external forces Social development
prevails over gender discrimination and other structural biases The health system is very strong and
resistant to the effects of social forces and it is configured to address rare or emerging complications

correlate strongly with maternal mortality levels
demonstrating the crucial role of health systems in
safeguarding maternal health against external forces In
contrast the less strong correlations between other social
indicators eg Gini index that measures national income
or wealth distribution and maternal mortality suggests
that the relationship is more distant possibly indirect or
mediated by other factors
Caesarean section rate as an indicator deserves further
consideration which is beyond the scope of our analysis
Notably countries with high and very high maternal
mortality in maternal mortality transition stages and
showed a very low median caesarean section rate at the
country level ie a caesarean section rate well below
This finding suggests that underuse of this intervention
might have a contributory role in maternal mortality
However the relationship between caesarean section rate
and maternal mortality at the country level is not linear
The correlation between caesarean section rate and
maternal mortality is only moderate O and might
be subject to an upper limit as countries with low and
very low maternal mortality presented similar median
caesarean section rates at the country level in the range

This multifactorial causal pathway makes the collective
goal to reduce maternal mortality a complex endeavour
due to the absence of a single solution Although maternal

countries according to MMR levels aims to identify
patterns of determinants that would be more influential
in each stage of transition Such stratification might have
several limitations which should be considered
Nonetheless a typology of transition stages derived from
tables and is presented in table These transition
stages their characteristics and key attributes of maternal
health determinants could be some of the several pieces of
information used in developing multisectoral strategies to
improve maternal health and wellbeing
Conclusions and recommendations for policy
and research
Maternal ill health and disability are social problems
and maternal mortality is a social tragedy The reduction
of maternal mortality and the promotion of maternal
health and wellbeing are complex endeavours This
paper in the Series on maternal health describes the deep
connections between maternal health outcomes and
modifiable and unmodifiable factors that are often
ignored in intervention programmes because of their
complexity Tackling maternal mortality will require
broader actions that go beyond biomedical causes which
manifest at a late stage in the events between a healthy
state and severe morbidity or death Policy makers
particularly those in countries with high maternal
mortality burden must recognise that the main
biomedical causes eg postpartum haemorrhage pre
eclampsia infection and abortion of preventable
maternal deaths do not happen in isolation That
countries have remained in the same mortality
transition bracket for the past two decades is therefore
unsurprising For countries to progress across transition
stages in their mortality reduction efforts there must be
renewed focus on strategies to address the underlying
determinants described in the previous sections
Multisectoral action to promote social development and
gender equality is necessary for sustainable reduction in
maternal mortality Although the implementation of
these strategies eg improvements in social infrastructure
and other social transformation programmes is often
slow to realise their longer term benefits are reasonably
certain
In this context the health sector has a pivotal role to play
Social aspects aside actions taken by the health system at
the health service level represent a final opportunity to
save the lives and improve the health and wellbeing of
women who have birth related complications Expanding
the health sector ecosystem and care networks to mitigate
the detrimental effects of distal and proximal determinants
will substantively improve maternal health Expanding
demand for and increasing access to high quality
reproductive health services and commodities eg modern
contraception safe abortion and antenatal intrapartum
and postpartum care are needed for primary prevention
Series
coverage and strengthening the health system to provide
quality care is essential to reduce maternal mortality and
promote maternal health and wellbeing
Future research should aim to establish the correlation
between key determinants and stages of the maternal
mortality transition at national or regional levels to
facilitate evidence informed and individually tailored
strategies and rapidly accelerate countries towards a very
low maternal mortality transition stage
