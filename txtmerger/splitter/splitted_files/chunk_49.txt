Empirical framework
Estimation strategy
We use the following empirical specification to investigate the effect
of a couple s contraceptive use on the HAZ and WAZ of children
where Yi refers to the outcome of interest HAZ or WAZ of child i
Everusedi denotes an indicator variable equal to if child i s parents
have ever used contraceptive measures and O otherwise Xi is the vector
of child specific controls Mi is the vector of child i s mother s char
is the vector of child i s household controls As denotes
acteristics
state fixed effects Our parameter of interest captures the effect of
the couple s use of contraception on their child s health outcomes All
standard errors are clustered at the survey cluster level
Oster also suggests that if a coefficient is stable after the inclusion
of the observed controls this can be taken as a sign that the omitted variable
bias is limited We also provide robustness of our baseline results with the
inclusion of additional controls in Section
Note that of women have used some contraceptive method in the
NFHS sample for the years We use the NFHS data in the
robustness Section
Our measure of wealth is based on the wealth index provided by DHS
which is a standardized measure of household economic status in a given
survey The households are divided into poorest poor middle richer and
richest households by the DHS

Notes The sample is restricted to women married only once The data provides information on all children
aged below years born to surveyed women Mother s BMI is a categorical variable ranging from O for
underweight to for obese The HH wealth index is a composite measure of a household s cumulative
living standard and ranges from poorest to richest Backward is a binary indicator of whether the
household belongs to the scheduled caste scheduled tribe or other backward classes or not
Identification strateu
To alleviate concerns of bias caused by omitted variables our
estimation technique incorporates a comprehensive set of controls
We additionally account for any systematic state level unobservables
that may affect contraceptive use by including state fixed effects But
because numerous unobservables could be linked with both Everusedi
and Yi the problem with the estimation of Eq
is that Everusedi
might be endogenous A causal interpretation of would demand that
there be no unobserved factors that are correlated with both Everusedi
and Yi conditional on our controls Concerns about endogeneity may
also arise if causality runs from the child s nutritional outcome to
Everusedi For instance the nutritional status of older children may
influence the couple s usage of contraceptives for subsequent pregnan
cies Additionally since Everusedi is self reported measurement error
in the variable could result in endogeneity The OLS estimate of
would be biased and inconsistent as a result of these issues In order
to determine the impact of the use of contraceptive measures on the
anthropometrics measures HAZ and WAZ we thus utilize an IV TSLS
technique
To construct our instrument we use data on family planning mes
sages from mass media sources like radio television and newspapers
First we define a binary variable that takes the value if the woman
has heard about family planning either on the radio or TV or newspaper
and O otherwise Each household in our sample receives a binary
We also utilize the OLS estimation technique to examine the effect of
contraceptive use on child health For brevity we do not include those results
in the paper The results are available upon request
indicator of media exposure as a result We then create a district average
of media exposure to generate our instrument We contend that the
couple s usage of contraceptives is inextricably linked to the average
exposure of women to family planning messages through mass media
This is consistent with a significant body of research that demonstrates
how information conveyed through mass media programmes can in
crease the use of family planning and alter reproductive behavior Jah
et al Agha and Van Rossem Gupta et al Olenick
exhibits the correlation between our IV and main variable
Fig
of interest Everusedi Note that there is a strong positive correlation
between them
Besides conditional on the controls the only channel through
which district average media exposure to family planning messages
would affect child i s nutritional status is through actual family plan
ning reproductive practices of the parents Thus we assert that our IV
is compelling in that it not only has a strong correlation with our key
variable of interest Everusedi but also does not have a direct effect
on HAZ and WAZ Further while including state fixed effects allays
We use a district level IV instead of a woman s own exposure to such
information as we believe that taking the district average makes the IV more
exogenous in nature than her own media exposure A woman s own media
exposure may be more highly correlated with several household level unob
servables such as intra marital bargaining access to household resources as
well as autonomy and relative position in the household These unobservables
plausibly have a direct impact on the health outcomes of children in that
household thus threatening the validity of household level IV Moreover own
media exposure is self reported and may suffer from measurement error As
such considering district averages reduces the measurement error making it
more appropriate as an IV and valid conditional on observables

Extensions
Modern methods of contraception
Here we extend our baseline analysis with the aim of specifically
examining the effect of using modern methods of contraceptives on the
HAZ and WAZ scores Typically to easily categorize family planning
methods modern contraceptive methods are defined as any product or
medical procedure that interferes with reproduction from acts of sexual
intercourse Hubacher and Trussell Following this definition
for our data this includes pills IUD injections diaphragms male
condoms female condoms female and male sterilization foam or jelly
and emergency contraception Traditional methods of contraception
consist of periodic abstinence withdrawal other traditional methods
lactational amenorrhea and standard days method First we study the
effect of modern contraception methods versus traditional methods or
not using contraceptives Second we examine the impact of modern
methods of contraceptives versus not using any contraception Third
we look at the effect of traditional methods of contraceptives versus no
contraception
presents the results Columns and provide the results
Table

We also examine the effect of using modern versus traditional contracep
tives on child health for the subsample that reports using contraceptives We
find a positive and statistically significant impact of using modern methods
over traditional on a child s HAZ WAZ scores by SD However the
IV does not perform well on the specification tests and thus warrants caution
in interpreting these results as causal
Economic Modelling
couple has only ever used modern contraceptive methods and O if
they use traditional or no contraceptives The results are statistically
significant and we document an increase in the HAZ WAZ scores
by SD Columns and present the results where the
endogenous variable takes the value if the couples use only modern
contraceptives and O otherwise excluding those using traditional con
traceptive methods Again we note that the effects are largely robust
and similar HAZ WAZ increases by SD if the couples use
modern methods relative to not using any contraception method From
column and we find evidence that if couples use traditional
methods of contraception it leads to a rise in the HAZ WAZ score of
the child by SD Our IV fairs well in the specification tests
Other measures of nutritional deficiencies Stunting and underweight
Further we measure the effect of contraceptive use on other mea
sures of child nutritional status Specifically we focus on stunting
and underweight indicators Stunting based on a child s height and
age is considered a measure of chronic nutritional deficiency Under
weight on the other hand is based on a child s weight and age and
is considered a composite measure of both acute and chronic nutritional
Stunting typically results from long term
statuses
Croft et al
nutrition deprivation and leads to delayed mental development and
reduced intellectual capacity while being underweight significantly
increases the mortality risk
We consider both stunting and underweight as binary variables for
our analysis Stunted takes the value if the child is moderately or
severely stunted and O if the child is not stunted Our measure of
underweight similarly takes the value if the child is moderately or
acutely underweight and O otherwise More specifically
O not stunted
if H AZ
Stuntedi
I moderately acutely stunted if HAZ
Underweighti
O not underweight
if w AZ e
I moderately acutely underweight if WAZ
Given that our outcomes here stunted or underweight are binary in
nature as well as our variable of interest everused we utilize Roodman
s conditional mixed processes CMP framework as our IV esti
mation approach We present the results in
Columns
Table
present the marginal effects for Stunted and columns present
the same for Underweight without controls with controls and with fixed
effects added subsequently
Examining our most preferred specification including comprehen
Sive controls and fixed effects for Stuntedi in column we note that
if a couple uses contraception the probability that the child is stunted
decreases statistically significantly by percentage points pp As
we move to Underweighti we note a negative and statistically signifi
cant effect of contraceptive use on the probability of the child being
underweight see column the likelihood of being underweight
decreases by pp
In summary our results for the measures of chronic and acute nutri
tional deficiencies confirm our baseline results on HAZ and WAZ The
negative effects of a couple s contraceptive use on a child being stunted
or underweight corroborate the effects we find on the anthropometric
measures
Children whose weight for age z score WAZ is more than SD above the
mean as per WHO Child Growth standards are categorized as overweight for
age Since we are looking at nutritional deficiency we only consider whether
or not a child is underweight stunted as our main outcome variables We also
ran the analysis for the overweight category and found that contraceptive use
can lead to a slight increase in the likelihood of being overweight Results can
be made available upon request

Robustness
Falsification analysis
So far our findings indicate a positive and statistically significant
effect of a couple s use of contraception on their child s anthropometric
measures for nutrition surveillance Here we aim to demonstrate that
such a result cannot be reached using any randomly assigned HAZ and
WAZ outcomes To accomplish this we maintain the first stage link
between our endogenous regressor and our instrument while randomly
rearranging our outcome variables In other words we associate a ran
dom child j s HAZ and WAZ scores to the use of contraception by child
i s parents instrumented by the district average of women s exposure to
contraceptive methods through mass media Ceteris paribus this makes
the association between our dependent variables and the regressors in
our estimation random
We replicate this analysis times and show that of
the times there is no significant impact of the use of contraceptives on
the randomly assigned HAZ WAZ measure at level significance
To be precise we are unable to reject the null that the effect of
the use of contraceptives is equal to zero out of times
for HAZ WAZ Fig
plots the t statistics obtained corresponding to
the coefficients of contraceptive use on both HAZ and WAZ in each
of the replications This falsification test reveals that repeated
estimations with random assignments of contraception choice do not
produce significant results on children s anthropometric measures and
thus we are unable to falsify our baseline estimates
Household level sample
We estimate our preferred baseline specifications using data at the
individual child level where we consider multiple children per couple
and household A worry with this level of analysis is that given our data
limitations we only know if the couple has ever used any contraception
method We are unable to determine when the couple may have used
contraceptives or which pregnancy did it delay or affect In addition
since the number of children per couple can vary households with
more children repeat themselves in the data more than households with
one or fewer children in the analysis at the child level To address these
potential concerns and check the sensitivity of our baseline results
we also estimate our desired impacts using aggregated household level
data For every household we look at the average child characteristics
Instead of controlling for birth order and multiple births we now control
for the total number of sons and the total number of daughters in the
household

Inclusion of additional district level controls
Our baseline regressions include child mother and household
level characteristics However it may be unrealistic to assume that
all district level characteristics affecting a couple s use of contracep
tives are uncorrelated with district level exposure to family planning
messages over mass media Thus we extend our set of controls to
include several district level average characteristics This addresses any
additional concerns regarding whether our IV satisfies the exclusion
restriction With this analysis we are also able to check if our baseline
results are robust to the inclusion of district controls Specifically
we include information on the number of health sub centers primary
health care centers community health care centers sub divisional hos
pitals and district hospitals at the district level as additional controls
We also utilize information on the district average of women s access to
both prenatal and antenatal care provided by ICDS workers Anganwadi
workers whether the respondent received any supplementary nutrition
from Anganwadi centers during pregnancy whether the child received
any benefits from Anganwadi in the last months whether the child
received food from Anganwadi centers in the last months how
often did the woman visit Anganwadi ICDS workers in the last
months the services and matters regarding pre school nutrition and

order of pp in the probability of being underweight as a result of
limiting fertility through contraceptives While we find that in both

once state fixed effects are included we believe this is driven by some
degree of measurement error or imprecision in the data
By estimating the impact using an earlier round of data we pro
vide evidence that nutritional deficiency is a chronic problem for
the country that has yet to show much improvement This may be
a severe challenge for India in view of the COVID crisis which
has deteriorated an already critical situation India faces in terms of
malnourishment

WAZ The following findings are noticeable from this heterogeneity
analysis
By sex of the child From both panels the estimates in columns
and show the effect of contraception use on the child s anthropo
metric measures We find a much larger statistically significant impact
on a girl s HAZ score compared to boys A couple s use of contraception
increases a girl s HAZ score by SD whereas a boy s HAZ score
increases by SD Also we find a statistically significant effect for
girls but not boys when we consider their WAZ scores Specifically we
note that the use of contraceptives increases a female child s WAZ by
SD
By caste We find a statistically significant effect of contraceptive
use on children s anthropometric measures for the backward caste
Contraceptive use increases the child s HAZ and WAZ by SD and
SD respectively No such effect is noted for the upper caste That
said a word of caution warranted here is that the sample size reduces
by a large extent for the upper caste sample
By area of residence Looking at the heterogeneous effects of con
traceptive use on children s health by rural or urban areas we find
statistically significant effects for rural areas for both HAZ and WAZ A
child s HAZ increases by SD and WAZ by SD in rural areas We
We provide additional heterogeneity analysis based on the mother s age
mother s education and child s birth order following a LASSO algorithm to
determine important covariates These results are presented in the Appendix
do not find a statistically significant effect of limiting fertility through
the use of contraceptives on the nutritional outcomes of children in
urban areas
By wealth We divide our sample into poor and rich households
and find statistically significant positive effects of contraceptive use on
children s HAZ for both poor as well as rich households Whereas when
considering WAZ as our outcome we only find an effect for the sub
sample of poor households Looking at the estimates for HAZ in column
the effect is larger for the poor households and is of the order of
SD for HAZ for the poor households and SD for the wealthy
households The effect of limiting fertility through contraceptives in
poor households shows a SD rise in WAZ of children
Heterogeneous effects of using modern contraceptive methods
We extend the heterogeneity analysis and examine the effect of
explicitly using only modern contraceptive methods on the HAZ and
WAZ for the same sub samples The pattern of results is similar and
robust for the sub samples of poor households rural households and
households belonging to the backward caste as in
Table Table
presents the results The impacts of using modern contraceptives are
stronger and statistically significant in columns and
which speak to the importance of access and awareness of contracep
tion for these sub samples A large proportion of our sample belongs
to rural India and almost of the households are either classified
as belonging to the poor or the poorest category of the wealth index

Considering this it is likely that the poor the backward castes and rural
households are more supply constrained in terms of access and ease of
using modern methods of contraceptives which is possibly driving the
more important effects we find in the heterogeneity analysis
Potential mechanism quantity quality trade off
Here we attempt to study a potential mechanism explaining the
positive effects of contraceptive use on child health that aligns with
the Becker and Lewis Becker and Tomes model of the
quantity quality trade off of children Extant literature documents that
increased parental time with children has significant implications on
early childhood development as well as future human capital accumu
lation
Gahramanov et al Milkie et al Parent s choice
to use contraceptive measures to limit the number of children born
may therefore have important implications on resource allocation per
child the quality of children s outcomes and thus their nutritional
status Relatedly there is substantial evidence recording negative as
sociations between the use of contraception and family size Cleland
and Harris Dills and Grecu Alam and
Abiona Kearney and Levine Ananat and
Hungerman To explore whether the effect of contraception
use on child health is dependent on the family size we conduct the

Notes Outcome variable in Column is a child s height for age z score whereas in Column it is the
child s weight for age z score The main explanatory variable is a binary indicator taking the value if the
couple has ever used any kind of contraceptive method and O otherwise The sample is restricted to woman
married only once All specifications correspond to a linear two staged least squares estimation where we
have interacted our main variable of interest contraception use with household size We have sequentially
added individual mother s and average child s characteristics district controls household controls and finally
state fixed effects Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the cluster level
and represent
significance at and respectively
following analysis where we interact our main variable of interest
Everused with household size Specifically we estimate the following
econometric specification
Yi DIEverusedi H Hsizei Everusedi H Hsizei
where Yi refers to the outcome of interest HAZ or WAZ of child i
Mi and are the vectors of child mother and household specific con
trols As denotes state fixed effects Our parameter of interest here
captures the effect of the couple s use of contraception on their child s
health outcomes as household size changes
Table
presents the re
sults for our outcomes HAZ and WAZ scores We find that as household
size increases the impact of contraception use on a child s HAZ and
WAZ scores decreases by SD and SD respectively These
effects are statistically significant Thus we note evidence of a negative
differential effect of the interaction between contraception use and
family size In other words as household size increases the beneficial
impacts of improved family planning on child health get smaller
In order to assess if a change in household size is truly the mecha
nism explaining the positive effects of contraception on child health
we further examine the channel running from quantity to quality
in our sample We first estimate the effect of contraception use on
household size as illustrated in Panel a of Table where we find
that a couple s use of contraception leads to a statistically significant
decline in household size Following this we generate the predicted
household size in line with the methodology followed by Bose et al
which we then use to explain a change in a child s HAZ WAZ
scores The results for this are reported in Panel b of
Table
Acknowledging that household size is likely endogenous we examine
its effect on child nutrition using our IV approach Based on Li et al
Rosenzweig and Zhang Kugler and Kumar Lee
Zhang we consider the birth of twins multiple births
as the instrument for an exogenous increase in the number of children
in the household That being said it is entirely possible that twin or
multiple births may also not be exogenous in that healthier women are
more likely to give births to twins or have multiple births as evidenced
Bhaiotra and Clarke
As such we restrict the sample to
children whose mothers never miscarried nor had stillbirths to address
the potential endogeneity of twins or multiple births as the IV Utilizing
