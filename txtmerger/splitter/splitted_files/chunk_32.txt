Introduction
ABSTRACT
Youth in foster care are often excluded from participating in planning for their permanent homes and making
other decisions about their lives In the past decade there has been an increasing call for laws policies and
practices that ensure a youth s right to participation in child welfare and other youth serving systems Child
welfare which is often associated with trauma lack of power and other disadvantages for involved families is a
complicated context for engaging youth in the processes intended to protect them From the motivational
perspective of Self Determination Theory SDT child welfare workers can understand promoting engagement as
creating conditions that meet a youth s basic psychological needs The current study used SDT as a framework to
analyze in depth interviews with youth about their experiences with family case planning meetings Findings
explain why different family meeting practices promoted or undermined youth engagement by creating certain
contextual conditions warm caring structured predictable and supportive of genuine preferences Some
family meeting practices functioned differently in promoting youth engagement depending on the extent to
which youth experienced their needs being met SDT offers both a way to understand casework practices in terms
of the conditions they create and a framework for reflecting on why certain practices operate in different ways
for different youth Workers who understand that engagement stems from meeting individual needs will be better
able to promote youth participation in family meetings and their well being

as necessary for making decisions about their futures

Relatedness is the need for connection with others feeling like
others care about you and having a sense of belonging and worth
Spending time with people who are warm and caring creates conditions
that meet one s need for relatedness whereas indifferent rejecting or
hostile interactions with a social partner can thwart this need
Competence is the need to feel effective in your ability to produce
desired outcomes learn new skills or to understand information In
teractions that offer structure and predictability e g clear communica
tion reliability responsiveness create conditions that meet one s need
for competence In contrast experiences that create chaos and uncer
tainty will fail to meet this need
Autonomy is the need to express your authentic self direct your own
action and have a sense of control Experiences that make room for and
support one s genuine preferences worldview and choices create con
ditions that meet one s need for autonomy On the other hand feeling
coerced or disregarded by a social partner can frustrate this need
SDT suggests that if an individual s three basic needs are met they
are more likely to be emotionally behaviorally and or cognitively
engaged in a given context and go on to experience greater well being
In the current study we
Deci Ryan Ryan Deci
define engagement as a youth feeling involved persistent focused and
or emotionally positive e g
Skinner Kindermann Connell Well
during their family case planning meetings SDT s focus on
born
needs fulfillment implies that the process of engagement should be
individualized because caseworker practices i e interactions with
youth during family meetings function differently depending on the
extent to which the practices create conditions that meet the youth s
needs For example frequent in person contact with their caseworker
might create warm and caring conditions for one youth which meets
their need for relatedness and therefore encourages engagement On the
other hand another youth could feel overwhelmed with too much in
person contact which would thwart their need for relatedness and un
dermine their engagement
Using SDT to organize the current literature on promoting youth
engagement
As described SDT defines contextual conditions that meet three
basic needs warm and caring conditions will meet needs for relatedness
structured and predictable conditions will meet needs for competence
and conditions that are supportive of genuine preferences meet needs for
autonomy These three contextual conditions offer a useful framework
for organizing existing research on caseworker practices

they have trusted and caring adult allies with some power in the child

Conditions that support genuine preferences
Conditions support a youth s genuine preferences when the youth
feels they have the agency to speak or express their desires opinions
and authentic self Caseworkers working to create these conditions
demonstrate their belief that the youth has the right to and is capable of
participating in their family s case planning Archard Skivenes
van Bijleveld et al Practices that support a youth s genuine
preferences include encouraging the youth to speak for themselves or
having a trusted adult speak for them and or offering alternative ways
for the youth to participate in family meetings
Cashmore
Family meeting facilitators can center youth voice by designating time
for the youth to speak insisting their opinions are thoroughly consid
ered not allowing other meeting attendees to dominate the conversa
tion and maintaining focus on the youth s needs and expressed desires
Augsberger If a youth s preferences cannot be honored case
workers can help the youth understand the reasons behind the decisions
Archard Skivenes van Bijleveld et al Kennan et al

Study goals
Through an SDT lens engaging youth in family meetings is a process
of centering youth s needs and creating conditions that meet them As
evidenced in the previous section caseworker practices that create
conditions that meet SDT s three basic needs are already reflected in the
literature Indeed
suggested that the most effective
Cashmore
ways to ensure young people are engaged in decisions that affect their
lives are for them to be able to talk with someone they trust related
ness to be informed about what is happening competence and to
have the opportunity and choice to say what it is they want autonomy
The goal of this study was to use SDT to analyze youth s experiences
with family meetings to identify the conditions that met their three basic
needs and to explain why certain practices created conditions that either
supported or undermined youth engagement In doing so we expected
Children and Youth Services Review
to find that some practices functioned differently for youth depending
on the extent to which the conditions met their unique needs Thus SDT
offers both a framework to organize family meeting practices and their
influence on youth engagement and a tool for reflecting on why certain
practices functioned differently for different youth
Methods
This research was part of a larger evaluation of Oregon s Title IV E
Waiver Demonstration known as LIFE The LIFE model combined
ongoing monthly family case planning meetings with a dedicated
trained facilitator referred to as the Family Engagement Facilitator
enhanced relative search techniques i e efforts to identify and include
kith and kin and peer parent mentors to increase parents engagement
in family meetings Child Welfare Partnership LIFE was founded
on four practice values parent driven youth guided strengths
based culturally responsive and trauma informed As part of the
LIFE model the youth guided practice value required that facilitators
made efforts to include youth in all facets of family meetings e g
preparation agenda development scheduling and logistics participa
tion and decision making Given the LIFE model s focus on youth
engagement the evaluation team conducted a sub study to better un
derstand the experiences of youth as their LIFE team worked to include
them in monthly family meetings
Recruitment procedures
Recruitment for the youth engagement sub study took place January
through April Forms and procedures were reviewed and
approved by a university human subjects review board and the child
welfare agency All new LIFE cases during this period were screened for
youth between the ages of and years old If both the facilitator and
the caseworker agreed that the youth was able to meaningfully physi
cally cognitively and emotionally participate in a minute inter
view and to understand what it meant to give consent assent to
participate the youth was invited to participate in the sub study As a
first step the facilitator approached the youth usually shortly after their
first family meeting told them about the study and asked them for
consent to share their contact information with the evaluation team If
the youth agreed the facilitator forwarded the youth s contact infor
mation to a designated evaluation team member n Facilitators
told the youth that agreeing to be contacted by the evaluation team did
not ensure they would be contacted Due to resource constraints the
evaluation team aimed to interview a sample of youth proportional to
caseloads across the three jurisdictions implementing LIFE services
The next step was for an evaluation team member to contact the
youth and invite them to participate in the sub study An evaluation
team member reached out to the youth by phone described the inter
view in more detail and answered their questions if any Youth
years old and older provided their own consent to participate Youth
years old and younger also needed consent from their legal guardian
typically their caseworker prior to an evaluation staff contacting them
Once contacted the evaluation team member asked the youth to assent
to participate If the youth agreed to participate the evaluation team
member scheduled an interview at a time and place that felt comfortable
to the youth
Interview procedures
Ideally interviewers had observed at least one of the family s case
planning meetings before doing the interview so they had some infor
mation about the meetings and the case and had an opportunity to build
rapport with the youth Due to delays in inviting youth to participate in
the evaluation the logistics of scheduling interviews and some youth
choosing not to participate in their family s meetings this did not
happen for approximately of the youth interviewed Most
C J Furrer et al
interviews took place within the first six months of the youth signing
their consent form although some occurred up to months after the
youth consented
Interviews lasted up to an hour but most took to minutes and
all were conducted in English Youth were interviewed at a location of
their choice typically their foster home or the child welfare office and
received a gift card for participating Four members of the evalua
tion team conducted interviews three are authors of this research One
evaluation staff and author conducted most interviews and the
remainder were split across three other staff two authors Interviews
were recorded with permission and transcribed for analysis
Participants
Evaluation staff invited youth to participate in an interview Of
those youth whose families were receiving LIFE services participated
in interviews On two occasions sibling pairs requested that they talk
with the interviewer together In addition six youth were available to
participate in both an initial and a follow up interview As shown in
the evaluation team conducted initial interviews with
Table
youth and six follow up interviews Youth were years old on
average but ages ranged from to missing age for one youth Just
over half the participants identified as male and the remainder
identified as female More than one third of the youth interviewed
identified as African American Black American Indian Native Amer
ican or Latine Hispanic whereas two thirds either identified
as white or their race ethnicity was unknown Most of the youth
lived in communities that met the federal criteria for rural
designation and the remaining resided in urban areas Most youth
completed their first interview within six months of agreeing to be
contacted by an evaluation staff and once interviewed most
had attended two or more of their family meetings
Interview guide
The interview guide was semi structured i e questions were
designed more like prompts to allow for flexibility in exploring topics
raised by youth and responsiveness to individual differences between
youth e g age gender family configuration This method allowed
interviewers to restate questions speak in a developmentally appro
priate manner probe for additional information and check for under
standing Moreover members of the LIFE Youth Advisory Board a
group of youth with lived experience in child welfare convened to
support the evaluation twice met with interviewers to help them

practice their approach e g language rapport building and provide
feedback for improvement
The interview was organized into five broad categories that aligned
with SDT s three basic needs personal goals informational needs voice
and choice their LIFE team and relationships In the personal goals
section the interviewer asked the youth to describe their personal goals
and the extent to which their LIFE team listened to and supported them
in pursuing their goals Questions in the informational needs section
asked whether the youth was getting the information they wanted about
their case from whom and how helpful it was Voice and choice ques
tions explored whether the youth had opportunities to make choices
about their lives if they felt like they had a say and if their LIFE team
listened and responded to them The LIFE team section included ques
tions about how the family meeting team worked to support their
participation and engagement Last the questions about relationships
focused on the youth s feelings of connection comfort and trust with
people on their LIFE team We invited the youth to talk about their ex
periences of LIFE services and with child welfare more generally
including what they found helpful unhelpful and suggestions for
improvement
Data analysis
We utilized thematic analysis Braun Clarke Hayfield Terry
and used AtlasTi qualitative analysis software for data manage
ment coding and analysis The person who conducted most of the in
terviews did an initial review of five transcripts Coding was both
inductive and deductive the five broad categories that organized the
interview guide provided a starting point but the team added themes as
they emerged from the data and an initial coding schema was devel
oped As the evaluation team completed additional interviews dyads
that included the interviewer coded transcripts Dyads first coded the
transcripts independently using the initial coding schema while being
open to the emergence of new themes then they met to check for
agreement identify emergent topics and resolve any differences After
they reached inter rater reliability agreement on all codes the inter
viewer coded the remaining transcripts and brought questions and new
topics to the evaluation team for discussion
The evaluation team met regularly to troubleshoot the process and
we used constant comparison to generate and refine the themes i e
examining themes in relation to each other and to the original interview
data For example the initial five broad categories were personal goals
informational needs choice the LIFE team and relationships As the
coding progressed we added themes pertaining to well being youth
voice and LIFE team responsiveness and the meaning of other themes
evolved from their original definitions The process was iterative and
multiple rounds of revisions occurred before the team finalized the
themes

Results
We organized findings using SDT s three supportive conditions

preferences Within each condition we explored how youth described
experiences that met their needs and promoted their engagement see
As expected there were functional differences in the extent to

follow through on requests for
information
Coercive or dismissive conditions
LIFE team members ignored

LIFE team members made
decisions on behalf of the youth
without their input
Youth invited to participate in an
adult focused family meeting
that didn t feel relevant to them
for relatedness and encouraged their meeting participation Taking time
to build a trusting relationship for example by spending time preparing
the youth for their family meeting was an important way in which
adults met a youth s need for relatedness In many cases the presence of
just one trusted individual e g relative caseworker facilitator foster
parent was enough to convince the youth to attend Youth often
mentioned counselors therapists and Court Appointed Special Advo
cates as people they trusted They thought of these people as being on
my side One youth described how coming to know their LIFE team
members helped them communicate more openly during meetings
I just have a group of people that I know personally that I have
known for some time now It is not just a complete group of
strangers that I barely know but I feel comfortable with them so I
don t really mind talking about stuff with them
In another example the facilitator helped a youth feel accepted by
the group which in turn promoted the youth s engagement
We had this one meeting because I did something stupid and
facilitator asked if anyone would want to share anything they did
similar in their teenage years And all of them did It just made me
feel more close to them they opened up to me so I thought I might
as well open up to them too
In contrast sometimes youth did not experience interactions with
their LIFE team as warm and caring A few youth did not feel comfort
able speaking at the meeting because the team made them feel anxious
confused or fearful of saying something that might make things worse
Children and Youth Services Review
This lack of trust in their LIFE team made it more challenging for youth
to participate in meetings Moreover participating in a meeting that
focused on what the youth had done wrong as one youth put it made
them feel like I am just in a meeting about people just criticizing me
Conditions in which a youth felt criticized or rejected undermined their
need for relatedness
Including siblings or other family members helped many youth feel a
sense of connection to the people present and therefore more willing to
participate in meetings One youth chose to go to LIFE meetings because
I take that as a time to see my siblings and when the siblings stopped
going the youth saw no point in attending However including family
members did not universally meet youth s need for connection and
therefore did not always encourage engagement Some youth said they
avoided meetings because they did not want to see their parents or other
relatives or they wanted to avoid conflict between family members For
example one youth explained how the presence of a family member
interfered with their ability to share their placement preferences
When my relative is on the phone during a meeting I can t really
talk want to make my relative happy Whenever I am there she
says I wish you could just come stay with me I don t want to hurt her
feelings but I don t really want to live with her I do want to go stay
with her just for the holidays and stuff
This example highlights how a practice inviting family members to
participate in meetings that promoted warmth and connection for some
youth discouraged engagement for others because it did not create
conditions that met their need for relatedness
Structured predictable conditions
Family meeting practices that created structure and predictability
such as having regular meetings sharing information transparency and
preparing youth for meetings helped meet youth s needs for compe
tence and encouraged their participation For some youth having reg
ular meetings helped them know what was going on with their family s
case Access to information according to SDT can meet a youth s need
for competence and therefore encourage their participation in their
family meeting One youth described it
I want to be there because I am the child that is in foster care and I
want to know what s going on instead of just being outside of the
box and not knowing what is going on I want to be inside of the box
and know
In addition to hearing more about what was going on with their
family s case regular meetings provided some youth with an opportu
nity to ask questions of their LIFE team One youth explained how
meetings were an opportunity for them to fill in missing information and
to discuss certain topics They go over every little bit of the case and if
they missed something then you can tell them and ask them if they can
talk about it and most likely they will
Regular meetings were also a way for youth to have transparent
conversations and develop a shared understanding of key issues with
their team Illustrating this point a youth described their experience
with meetings
It gets you on a plan makes you more aware of what s happening
gets everyone together so they are in the room discussing stuff It just
feels better to have everyone at once instead of going individually to
talk to people Everyone gets the picture and the idea all at once
Youth did not uniformly experience information sharing and trans
parent conversations as creating structured and predictable conditions
and therefore did not meet their needs for competence and encourage
participation in family meetings For example some youth did not want
to hear about the bad stuff going on in their family because it led to a
loss of hope and feelings of apathy and helplessness especially if the
youth had a long history in child welfare One youth said I don t really
C J Furrer et al
like to go to the meetings It is just that I don t really like talking about
some of the stuff that is going on Furthermore not all youth were able
to get their questions answered during meetings One youth said that
their caseworker doesn t know sometimes so it is kind of difficult
getting answers Together these findings underscore the importance of
learning about a youth s needs before enacting a practice
Meeting preparation practices often created structured and predict
able conditions by giving youth advance information about the agenda
and who would attend and by providing opportunities for them to ask
questions request information and express needs These conditions
according to SDT can support a youth s need for competence and
encourage engagement One youth described how their facilitator met
with them before their first meeting and explained what was going to
be talked about who all was going to be there and anybody that I
wanted to be there to support me
In contrast some youth had negative experiences during meetings
because they were not prepared by their facilitator or the facilitator did
not follow through on what had been discussed during preparation
Youth who were not prepared sometimes experienced their LIFE team as
demanding information and explanations they weren t prepared to
provide These more chaotic conditions did not meet the youth s need
for competence and made them feel pressure to share more information
than they wanted One youth explained When we talked about me
running away I felt a lot like people did get really needy They needed
to just know everything about why when I don t know
Conditions that support genuine preferences
One of the LIFE model s underlying values was youth guided and
meetings were designed to encourage youth participation and involve
ment in decision making Having a voice and opportunities to make
choices being listened to getting explanations for why decisions were
made and participating in meetings that feel relevant are practices that
can create conditions supportive of youth s genuine preferences which
meet their need for autonomy and encourage engagement Some youth
described how their LIFE team listened to them responded to their
needs and acted upon their requests One youth said they actually
listen especially when we are all in the meetings So actually hearing
what we have to say they can put it into action Another youth
described how their LIFE team was responsive to their needs It is nice
to get with everybody especially when I need something Everyone is
there and I can tell them all straight up what I need so they all work on it
That is pretty helpful
Including youth in decision making about permanency options
especially if the plan shifted away from reunification felt supportive for
many youth For example some LIFE teams spent time exploring per
manent placement options allowing youth to have a say about their
future One youth described that the agency let them choose where they
wanted to live
we can stay if we want to with relative I think she is trying to
get DHS out of it with us plus we really don t want to go back with
our parent yet or at all if that I wanted to stay here and my
parent finally gave custody to my relative for us so we can go
wherever
It was important for youth to feel like their family meetings were
relevant to them and that they had some say about the content Some
youth said their facilitators offered them choices about what would be
discussed For example a youth described how before the meetings
facilitator will call me and ask me what we can talk about and what we
can t talk about In contrast some youth described meetings as too
parent focused and said that they felt tedious repetitive uninforma
tive and pointless One youth described their family meetings as
parent centered which discouraged their participation
Children and Youth Services Review
So I don t go anymore because the meetings were very parent
centered and on top of that it was the same thing every time It
was all about Mom and it was super irritating I am being dragged out
of school where I want to be We would go and it would be Mom
Mom Mom now let s talk about the kids for the last min I
was like I don t care about what she s doing I thought it was going
to center around us and how we were feeling and what we need It is
more revolving around my mom
Youth also described practices that created conditions that made
them feel coerced or disregarded thereby thwarting their need for au
tonomy and undermining their engagement in family meetings For
example some youth noted that their LIFE team was unresponsive or
even went against their wishes others felt the team was judgmental or
critical Another youth described a lack of follow through I just feel
when I ask to know something people say they are going to find out but
they don t really do it that much Youth also described being inter
rupted when they spoke and others felt a lack of support for goals
choices and desires One youth said
All the meetings nobody ever listened to me on any of my opinions
on things They would ask how I felt about certain things that
happened in the case and I said I don t really like it but they would
do it anyway
Some youth said that their LIFE teams disregarded their input ideas
and preferences As one youth put it Just because I m a kid doesn t
mean I don t know what I am talking about I do know what I m talking
about I have been through enough to know what I m talking about
Beyond feeling disregarded by their team some youth felt that the child
welfare system more generally discounts the notion that youth know
what is best for them One youth asserted that they knew what was best
for them in terms of a permanent placement
I knew what was best for me and I knew it was not going to city
and being put in some other random foster care with some people I
had no idea who they were I don t do very well with strangers
Yet another youth pointed to the power differential that youth
experience in foster care
don t think that they think that anybody that is not an adult has
a very good opinion on what they need in life because they are adults
and they have been trained in this kind of thing so obviously they
know best
These results suggest that some practices created conditions that
youth experienced as coercive and dismissive which failed to meet their
needs for autonomy and undermined their engagement in family
meetings
Discussion
This research brought SDT s motivational lens to the process of
engaging youth in child welfare family case planning meetings It also
centered youth s experience of family meeting practices and how they
functioned differently in creating conditions that supported their
engagement depending on the extent to which their needs for related
ness competence and autonomy were met Findings suggest that SDT is
consistent with other literature on youth involvement in family decision
and adds value by offering an orga

conditions warm and caring structure and predictability and sup
portive of genuine preferences can meet youth s basic psychological
needs and encourage their engagement in family meetings
Three conditions that promote engagement
A key finding was that youth were more engaged in their family
C J Furrer et al
meetings when they experienced warm and caring conditions Indeed
SDT suggests that warm and caring relationships support the funda
mental need for relatedness which in turn encourages engagement in
that context This finding is consistent with previous research that points
to the importance of having trusted and caring adults who are seen as
allies
Augsberger Kennan et al van Bijleveld et al
It was found that having someone who knew and could advocate for the
youth helped them feel more willing to participate in meetings and
openly share their thoughts Spending time getting to know LIFE team
members both through regular family meetings and outside of meet
ings helped to build warm and caring relationships
In contrast when youth did not have a relationship or connection
with their LIFE team members or if they experienced indifference or
rejection during their family meetings their need for relatedness was
not met which undermined their engagement This finding extends the
current literature by suggesting that there are multiple pathways to a
youth s experience of warmth and care and that a strategy that is sup
portive for one youth may undermine another youth s experience One
example is involving family members For some youth having family
members participate in family meetings created warm and caring con
ditions which met their need for relatedness For other youth having
family members participate led to conflict which undermined their need
to connect and therefore their willingness to engage As such the sub
jective experience of needs satisfaction rather than a specific practice
predicts engagement

As a child welfare practice LIFE meetings offered regular opportu
nities to gather a team of people to share information in a clear and
transparent way and develop a common understanding of goals and
plans Meeting preparation and facilitation practices that created
structured and predictable conditions included having the informa
tion needed to plan act and ultimately find permanent placements for
youth Indeed many youth participants experienced their need for
competence being met through meeting preparation and participating in
regular family meetings see also

From a youth empowerment perspective including youth in their
family meetings counters a common narrative in child welfare about
protecting youth from information about their family that they are too
young to understand what is happening and that certain topics e g
legal or policy issues may not be relevant or appropriate for youth to
hear e g
Dillon et al Toros van Bijleveld et al
Beyond including youth findings from the current study suggest that
protecting youth from or withholding information at least for the older
youth interviewed created conditions that thwarted their need for
competence and undermined their engagement in family meetings
Moreover family meetings that did not offer structured and predictable
conditions e g lack of preparation lack of transparency demands or
pressure from family team members also served to undermine youth s
engagement Taken together these findings imply that the challenge of
engaging youth in family meetings may be less about youth s ability to
be involved than it is about the willingness and capacity for adults to
engage youth
Toros
Last youth often experienced LIFE meetings as youth focused rele
vant to what they wanted to discuss and as opportunities for them to
make choices or have some say over what was happening with their
family s child welfare case all conditions that supported youth s
genuine preferences Many youth also described having a LIFE team
that listened to them and responded in a timely manner by following
through on promises fulfilling requests and providing requested in
formation These practices created conditions that supported the youth s

The child welfare system which encourages adults to quickly make

ways that support youth s need for autonomy Indeed youth inter

ignored their preferences and made decisions on their behalf without
their input or an explanation for the thinking behind the decision
