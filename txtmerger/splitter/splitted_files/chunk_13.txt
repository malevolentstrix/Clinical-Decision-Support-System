senic is an established human toxicant and group carcinogen
World
Health Organization and maternal As exposure during fetal
development has been linked to increased risk of adverse health out
comes later in life including cancers of the lung bladder liver and
larynx cardiovascular disease and reduced lung function Farzan et al
Vahter
In utero and early life exposure has been asso
ciated with increased childhood morbidity
Farzan et al
Rahman et al
The teratogenic effects of As have been well established in rodent
models Ferm and Hanlon Hill et al Hood Hood
and Bishop Kozul Horvath et al Moore et al
Morrissey and Mottet et al Findings from
epidemiological studies of the association between in utero As exposure
and birth outcomes in humans have been inconsistent which is mostly
likely due to differences in study design exposure assessment sample
size population studied and levels of exposure Considering the cu
mulative evidence a recent review by Milton et al found an insufficient
number of studies addressing neonatal death and preterm birth but
consistent and convincing evidence of the association between high
As exposure and increased risk of spontaneous abortion stillbirth and
low birth weight
Milton et al
Additionally a meta analysis
conducted by Zhong et al found a negative association between in utero
As exposure and birth weight
Zhong et al
However little is
known regarding potential mechanisms by which arsenic would affect
these birth outcomes
Numerous epidemiological studies have examined the association
between in utero As exposure and birth weight shortened gestation
and or intrauterine grown restriction These birth outcomes have been
shown to have varying effects on disease risk later in life Wardlaw
et al
Shortened gestation is associated with increased risk of
infant mortality morbidity and disability whereas restricted in
trauterine growth is associated with decreased growth in childhood and
increased morbidity in later in life Several studies have evaluated birth
weight and gestational age as independent outcomes associated with in
utero As exposure finding no significant association with either out
come particularly at low levels of exposure Bloom et al Freire
et al
or a significant negative association with both outcomes
Xu et al
Mediation analyses including birth weight and ge
stational age may help to understand the health effects of in utero As
exposure For example in this cohort our group found that the in utero
As exposure was related to gestational age and maternal weight gain
during pregnancy and these factors mediated the effect between As and
birth weight
Kile et al
Subsequently there was no direct effect
of As on birth weight in this cohort
Changes in the epigenome including DNA methylation DNAm
may be one mechanism underlying the associations between As ex
posure and multiple health outcomes Bailey et al
et al As explained by the developmental origins of health and
disease hypothesis environmental exposures during embryogenesis a
time of cellular differentiation and epigenetic reprogramming may
result in epigenetic dysregulation and increased disease risk
Heindel
and Vandenberg The DNA methyltransferases alpha
and beta are responsible for de novo DNAm in
embryonic cells Okano et al
and have
differential spatial and temporal expression during early embryogenesis
may have a more significant role in
Uysal et al
maintaining global DNAm particularly at distal promotors and non
and in imprinting Kaneda et al
CpG sites
Gu et al
is also involved in RNA polymerase binding and transcription
genetic imprinting mitotic cell cycle protein binding aging and reg
ulation of cell death Although the role of in birth outcomes
has not fully been established DNAm within the gene body of
has previously been associated with reduced gestational age in a Nor
wegian birth cohort PFDR
Bohlin et al
Due to the critical role of in establishing de novo DNAm
we hypothesized that DNAm of this gene could mediate the association
between As exposure occurring in the critical prenatal development
phase and adverse birth outcomes specifically birth weight and ge
stational age We also hypothesized that gestational age would act as a
mediator between in utero As exposure epigenetic changes and birth
weight We explored this hypothesis using structural equation models

Methods
Study population
Participants were from a prospective birth cohort of women exposed
to As through drinking water in Bangladesh in the Sirajdikhan and
Pabna Sadar upazilas This cohort has been described in detail pre
viously Kile et al Briefly women were recruited at s weeks
gestations age by Dhaka Community Hospital DCH Trust N
Eligibility criteria were having a single pregnancy using a tube well as
the main source of drinking water and planning to remain in the cur
rent residence for the duration of the pregnancy Women received free
prenatal care provided by DCH as well as prenatal vitamins which
were given to participants during monthly home visits Women gave
birth with DCH trained medical personnel at a local clinic or at their
home who collected all birth outcome data and cord blood was col
lected at birth This analysis utilized a sub sample of newborns
from the cohort that were selected for measurement of DNAm in whole
cord blood using pyrosequencing This sub sample was randomly se
lected across a range of arsenic exposure that was measured in the
household s drinking water We also restricted analyses to only vaginal
births to minimize the possibility of confounding which limited the
final sample size to newborns

Ethics
The study protocol was approved by the Human Research
Committees at the Harvard School of Public Health Oregon State
University and DCH Trust Prior to enrollment in the study informed
consent was obtained from all participants
Laboratory measures
Maternal toenail As Arsenic concentrations in maternal toenail
samples were measured as a biomarker of exposure during pregnancy
Arsenic has an affinity for sulfhydryl groups and accumulates in scler
oproteins and therefore toenail As concentrations at the distal tip re
presents a time integrated measure of ingested As during the previous
months of nail growth and has been shown in previous research to
be highly correlated with water arsenic concentrations Karagas et al
Rodrigues et al
Toenail clippings were collected from
mothers at the time of enrollment e g maternal toenails at enrollment
and within one month of delivery e g postpartum maternal toenails
The methods used to measure arsenic exposure have been previously
published Rodrigues et al Briefly samples were sonicated in
Triton X IOO solution Sigma Aldrich Inc St Louis MO and
rinsed in Milli Q water Millipore Corporation Billerica MA to remove
external contamination Then nails were digested in Trace Select Ultra
Pure nitric acid Sigma Aldrich Inc and diluted with Milli Q
water Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to
measure total arsenic concentrations PerkinElmer Model DRC II
Norwalk CT Arsenic concentrations of human hair references were
used to correct for method error using black correction and normal
ization CRM Hair Shanghai Institute of Nuclear Research Academia
Sinica China human hair was selected as the reference due to lack of
available toenail references Eighteen postpartum toenail samples were
missing Samples were dropped from analyses if they had a mass
mg N or relative standard deviation N One
sample below the batch limit of detection ranging gg As g
was also excluded
Maternal drinking water As At the time of enrollment participants
were asked to identify their main source of drinking water Kile et al
Water samples were collected preserved with ultrapure nitric
acid to a pH and stored at room temperature Arsenic con
centrations in water samples were measured using inductively coupled
mass spectrometry ICP MS with the US EPA method Environ
mental Laboratory Services North Syracuse NY Creed et al
Samples had an average percent recovery from plasmaCal multi ele
ment QC standard solution SCP Science of Thirty
samples below the LOD of gg L were replaced with LOD
Bisulfite pyrosequencing DNAm was quantified for
located on the north shore of a CpG
island within the gene body of
These CpG sites were selected as the target site for bisulfite pyr
osequencing because they were included on the Illumina Infinium
BeadChip Our rationale for this choice was to
help make the pyrosequencing data in this study relevant to other
methylation array data Coverage also included two downstream CpG
sites and Bisulfite pyrosequencing
was performed at EpigenDx Hopkinton MA using ng ul whole
cord blood DNA Bisulfite conversion was used to convert unmethylated
cytosines to uracil Following PCR amplification and direct pyr
osequencing the average percent DNAm was calculated Control sam
ples with low methylation medium methylation and high methylation
were included on each plate
Covariates Sociodemographic data were collected by trained inter
viewers during clinical visits Infant birth weight was measured by
trained study staff using a pediatric scale calibrated before each use
Gestational age in weeks was determined by ultrasound measurements
taken at enrollment by a licensed general practitioner using either

gestational sac mean diameter if the pregnancy was between and
weeks or crown rump length if the pregnancy was between and
weeks
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables Maternal
toenail As concentrations were right skewed and therefore trans
formed We assessed relationships between loci with quantified DNAm
and using Spearman
correlations Statistical mediation was evaluated using SEMs that in
cluded DNAm of all measured loci SEMs are a multivariate statistical
technique that allow for confirmatory analysis of a given hypothesis
Gunzler et al By simultaneously estimating multiple and re
lated regression like models SEMs allow for a given variable to act as
both an independent and dependent variable the term exogenous is
used to refer to variables that act only as independent variables and the
term endogenous is used to refer to variables that act as dependent
variables in at least one modeled regressions SEMs use underlying
latent or unmeasured variables defined by observed variables re
presenting same construct therefore addressing some forms of multi
collinearity DNAm of
and
was used as indicator variables to construct a latent
variable representing DNAm of Confirmatory factor analysis
was performed to test how well DNAm of the three CpG sites represent
DNAm of region
To understand the associations between As concentrations DNAm
of and birth weight independent of gestational age we first
built an SEM including logytransformed maternal toenail As con
centrations as independent variable birth weight as the dependent
variable and the latent variable representing DNAm of as a
mediator We similarly assessed associations between As concentra
tions DNAm of and gestational age independent of birth
weight A single SEM including both outcomes of interest birthweight
and gestational age was then used to assess mediation adjusting for
the potential confounders of infant sex and maternal education
primary vs primary education and the potential mediator of
maternal weight gain between enrollment and delivery Covariates
were selected based on a review of previous literature and observed
univariate associations between As exposure and birth outcomes in the
current study Birth weight was modeled in kg to ensure variances were
similarly scaled The full information maximum likelihood approach
FIML was used to estimate model parameters and robust estimates of
model fit were used due to skewness in DNAm variables Brosseau Liard
et al Brosseau Liard and Savalei For models including
categorical covariates i e infant sex and maternal education stan
dard errors were calculated from bootstrap samples In each
SEM model indices were examined to determine if including residual
correlations would improve model fit
Our primary measure of exposure was postpartum maternal toenail
As concentrations Toenail As concentrations provide a time integrated
biomarker of internal dose that reflects arsenic exposure from all routes
of exposure that occurred several months to a year prior to their col
lection
Kile et al
Therefore postpartum maternal toenail As
concentrations were selected to reflect the internal As dose that oc
curred during pregnancy We conducted sensitivity analyses using two
other arsenic exposure metrics maternal toenail As concentra
tions at enrollment and maternal water As concentrations In
addition we used linear models to test the associations between DNAm
of the target CpG site logytransformed postpartum
maternal toenail As concentrations birth weight and gestational age
Specifically we evaluated associations between the exposure maternal
toenail As concentration and outcome gestational age and birth
weight the mediator DNAm and the exposure maternal toenail As
concentrations and the mediator DNAm and the outcome gesta
tional age and birthweight

Consistent with our findings DNAm of the target CpG site
has previously been negatively associated with gesta

Bohlin et al
This study also found differential methylation throughout the
epigenome probes at for ultrasound estimated

gestational age at PFDR However additional CpG sites
annotated to were identified as differentially methylated and
a gene ontology GO analysis identified several pathways that included
the gene In addition in birth cohort in Tennessee one CpG

roles in DNAm RNA polymerase binding and transcription genetic

pathways involved in the observed association between me

Our study strengths included that gestational age was determined
by ultrasound at the time of enrollment which provides a more accu
rate estimation than reported last menstrual period In addition our
study is strengthened by the prospective birth cohort design with
multiple measures of As exposure during pregnancy Toenail As con
centrations reflect exposure during the prior several months to a year
Kile et al
Maternal toenail samples were collected within one
moth of delivery to provide an estimate of internal dose during preg
nancy and establish temporality Drinking water samples and maternal
toenail samples were also collected at the time of enrollment early in
pregnancy Overall results from sensitivity analyses using maternal
drinking water As levels and maternal toenail As concentration at en
rollment as the measures of exposure were consistent The slight dif
ferences in results could be a function of exposure misclassification
from using drinking water arsenic concentrations instead of biomarkers
of internal dose e g toenails or differences in As metabolism and
excretion between individuals Marchiset Ferlay et al
There is
evidence that the As metabolism may be associated with birth outcomes
Gelmann et al and may also influence DNAm Sex has also been
shown to influence arsenic metabolism Subsequently future studies
could examine As metabolism modifies DNAm of and birth
outcomes
Several limitations of our study should be noted We had missing
data on maternal toenail As concentrations N for maternal toe

We did not have data on DNAm at additional CpG sites
and did not measure gene expression Therefore we cannot determine
if changes in DNAm at the interrogated CPGs of lead to
changes in gene expression or chromatin conformation Nor can we
infer that methylation at these CpG sites represent methylation across
the entire gene The three CPGs measured in the current study are lo
cated with the gene body and DNAm within gene bodies has previously
been associated with gene expression

Abstract The scientific article evaluates the current areas
of health care management in the context of population aging
The peculiarities of population aging in some countries and
regions according to the level of economic development have
been clarified including among women and men The main
structural reasons that determine the rate of population aging
are identified demographic social economic environmental
The consequences of population aging for Ukrainian society
first of all its impact on the health care system have been
identified The state of health of elderly people in Ukraine is
analyzed and the priority directions of its preservation are
substantiated The methodological principles of calculating the
health index and determining the characteristics of population
inequality in terms of health from the standpoint of population
aging separately for men and women are summarized The
main goals of health care development in the context of aging
and the COVID pandemic have been identified
Keywords health care system management population
aging population health health index demographic processes
I INTRODUCTION
Population aging is a global phenomenon that has attracted
the attention of scientists and practitioners for many decades
In there were million people aged and over in
the world Most of them are women as they usually live
longer than men Over the next three decades the number of
older people worldwide is projected to increase to more than
double reaching over billion by The proportion of
the population aged and over is expected to increase from
in to approximately in
The aging process now covers almost all countries in the
world except which are defined by the UN as countries
with demographic differences In some countries this
process began in the middle of the last century in another in
the last decades Therefore the rate of population aging varies
from country to country Typically in countries where the
aging process has begun earlier the rate of aging is currently
low e g Sweden Fig l while in developing countries it is
higher and very high is expected e g Mexico or China Fig
Factors that determine the rate of population aging
include deformation of the sex and age structure of the
IEEE
population the level of economic development and welfare of
citizens the dynamics of the health care and social security
system the state of the environment etc
India
Mexico
Republic of Korea
South Africa
Fig l Proportion of population age
Of course population aging is directly related to changes
in births and marriages cohabitation and divorce general
trends in education among the population especially young
people and migration processes including from rural to urban
areas and international migration The main causes of
population aging are still declining birth rates and prolonging
life expectancy
II LITERATURE REVIEW
Many works of domestic and foreign scientists and
practitioners are devoted to the study of the problems of
population aging and its consequences In the context of the
purpose and objectives of this article several areas of research
can be identified the concept of demographic transition
general changes in age structure socio economic aspects of
this process the health of an aging population and challenges
to the health system

First of all it should be noted that the problem of
population aging has been the focus of international regional
and national institutions for many decades In particular the
UN whose experts publish annual reports Aging of the
world the World Health Organization conducts research
that highlights the results on the health and well being of
adults their relationship to the aging process in different
countries now and in the future in the reports Decade of
Healthy Aging Plan of Action World report on aging and
health Researchers of the US National Institute on Aging
and the US National Institutes of Health are conducting joint
research including Why Population Aging Matters
Due to the fact that population aging is one of the
manifestations of age structure transformation in the process
of demographic transition a special place in assessing the
peculiarities of the aging process belongs to the concept of
demographic transition
changing types of population
reproduction which is covered in a number of scientific
papers It is also worth noting that the assessment of the
age structure of the population and its future changes allows a
deeper understanding of the peculiarities of reproduction in
general and aging processes in particular
Scientists actively discuss the socio economic aspects of
population aging The research takes place in two
directions the impact of socio economic development on the
level of population aging and its socio economic
consequences
This topic is reflected in the works of Ukrainian scientists
The most fundamental work which highlights the latest
features of the aging population and its prospects the specifics
of lifestyle and socio economic status of the elderly the
challenges to social and economic development caused by
demographic aging is a collective monograph of scientists
from the Institute of Demography and Social Research named
after MV Ptukha of the National Academy of Sciences of
Ukraine
III CURRENT TRENDS OF AGING
Despite the general tendency of population aging in the
world the similarity of causes and effects there are some
differences between regions and countries More in depth
research shows that there is no hard standard for identifying
the causes of aging There are differences between countries
in the mode of reproduction in particular in the birth rate
gender and age structures which were formed in different
historical conditions were under the influence of various
factors wars epidemics pandemics economic crises
migration regimes predominance of emigration or
immigration etc The imposition of these and other
circumstances causes fluctuations in the rate of population
aging between countries and regions
Undoubtedly one of the main reasons that determine the
peculiarities of population aging are socio economic In fig
the dynamics of growth of the share of people aged
and older among the total population by countries with
different socio economic development Ukraine and some
European countries Sweden and Poland by sex is shown
The difference in population aging is quite significant
between countries with a high level of economic development
and countries with medium and low levels of development
And here the question is not only about the difference in
economic opportunities and what is connected with it the
level of medical and social services the state of health literacy
the quality of living and nutrition etc ie those determinants
that allow you to live longer Factors of such differentiation
are also indicators of a mode of reproduction In economically
developed countries birth rates and other marriage regimes
are significantly lower This may in some way explain the fact
that Ukraine which is not one of the countries with a high
level of economic development has a high rate of population
aging especially among women

Other features of aging which are shown in Fig First
of all they concern the difference in mortality rates between
men and women between different countries and regions It is
obvious that aging is greater among women than among men
However there are countries where this difference is quite
significant Thus in Ukraine the share of people years and
older among women exceeds the same figure for men by
times while
