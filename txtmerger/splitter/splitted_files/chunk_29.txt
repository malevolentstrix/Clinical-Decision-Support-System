t in some cases the Department provided mobile
phones to assist parents with contact with case workers Engagement
strategies by the Department and other service providers are essential
for working with these families many of whom are faced with high
levels of adversity historical mistrust challenges accessing services and
dealing with multiple and complex needs
Many of the families had requirements in relation in financial and
housing stability There is a wealth of evidence that families facing
poverty are more likely to be involved in child protection services
Bywaters et al The challenge for these families is not only
ensuring that they can provide evidence of their ability to budget and
meet the financial needs of their family but also attend appointments to
address their mental health drug and alcohol use and domestic violence
issues that are resulting in the safety concerns by the Department In
some of the safety plans this was acknowledged by caseworkers who
specifically stated what financial assistance would be provided to enable
parents to access assessments and counselling The associated issue of
housing was also mentioned in of the safety plans with most
required to maintain stable safe and hygienic accommodation Given
the complexity of issues that these families are facing maintaining
stable accommodation is a challenging issue This was mentioned in a
number of safety plans where mothers fleeing domestic violence were
Children and Youth Services Review
utilising violence restraining orders to assist with priority housing and
emergency housing services Some safety plans however were clear that
while the Department would provide the mother with a list of housing
support services and a letter of support relating to the priority list the
onus was specifically on the mother to actively source accommodation
and in some cases address the issues that led to homelessness Given the
social housing waiting list in WA which is approximately
households with a year average wait time many of these families will
struggle to maintain stable accommodation in the short term to meet this
The additional challenge is that to

address the other concerns of mental health and drug and alcohol use it
is essential to have stable housing to provide stability for recovery
Padgett
Domestic violence was another important child protection concern in
many of the safety plans There was variation in the requirements made
on families Many families were required to address this by being
referred to FDV anger management programs or for counselling with
some required to develop safety plans and to use a safety support
network Requirements in relation to perpetrator accountability was
mentioned in a number of the safety plans which put the onus on per
petrators to address their violent behaviour However there was some
concerning requirements in which the onus appeared to be on the
mother to demonstrate the ability to protect children from being
exposed to violence and to not enter into any future relationships with
an abusive partner There is also a challenge in that police reports could
be used as evidence as seen in cases and therefore if a mother contacts
police to report DV then this could potentially be used as evidence that
she is not able to protect her children from exposure to violence and
abuse In addition given that many of the families had difficulty
maintaining stable accommodation this would preclude them from
being provided some of the intensive support programs which would
support mothers facing domestic violence and the associated impacts of
trauma on mental health This issue is broader than child protection s
jurisdiction and will require ongoing government strategies to address
the social housing shortages and the complex interaction of services to
meet families with multiple and complex needs and who are experi
encing family violence Commonwealth of Australia
The complexity of issues described in the case files does indicate the
need for intensive support to assist families Families on average had
three family issues service referrals to address the concerns of the
Department with the main areas being drug and alcohol parenting
mental health and domestic violence The requirements across the
safety plans were numerous and many families were required to be
referred and seek support from multiple agencies There was no clear
indication from the safety plans who would provide case management
support for the family or assist them to meet the Department s re
quirements This is a challenge in the service provision space as the level
of intensity required to support these families with multiple and com
plex issues will be high and for services who are procured to only pro
vide DV mental health or substance use services it is a challenge to
provide families with the wrap around support they need for successful
outcomes This highlights the need for greater sophistication in strate
gies to support these families who cross multiple service systems and
have a high complexity of needs Supporting families to engage with pre
birth and post birth safety planning where their voices and articulation
of needs is vital in ensuring that these families are fully engaged and
supported throughout this process There is preliminary evidence that
pre birth independent facilitators utilised in WA pre birth meetings have
been viewed by families as important to enabling them to have a greater
voice in these meetings Trew et al Aboriginal family led deci
Sion making has been shown to be effective in Victoria and is being
trialled in WA to enable greater self determination and cultural safety
for Aboriginal families involved in developing family plans Department
of Human Services Victoria is also leading the way in their
innovative court model Marram Ngala Ganbu to address the over
representation of Aboriginal children in care with WA trialling an

alternative court model for families with cases prioritised for those
families involved in child protection processes during pregnancy and
infancy
Arabena et al
While this research has provided evidence of the care proceedings
involving infants in their first year of life where there are child protec
tion concerns it does have limitations The majority of the case files
accessed were based in the metropolitan area and unfortunately we did
not have capacity to review cases at regional courts An understanding of
these cases is important particularly given the over representation of
Aboriginal infants and the challenges of accessing services and support
in regional and remote communities What was particularly disap
pointing in the case file review was the lack of evidence in the files that
was used to support families or provide evidence to refute the claims
made by the Department Therefore the predominant views presented
to the court and in the files were in relation to the Department s child
protection concerns As the proceedings in the court are not available to
researchers this provides a gap in the evidence and would require re
searchers to seek permission from the court to be present during pro
ceedings There is also no evidence within the files to determine the
effectiveness of services assessment validity or the ability of families to
meet the caseworker requirements While these limitations should be
addressed in future research the evidence from this study on care pro
ceedings and the requirements of families to gain restoration of their
infants fills a gap in the current research
Over the last ten years we have seen an increase in the number of
pregnant mothers and families being notified to child protection services
nationally and internationally as well as a rise in the number of infants
coming into the care system All nations are committed to ensuring that
children can grow up safely with their family and therefore ongoing
international research and evidence is required to determine the effec
tiveness of processes to address safety concerns and support families to
achieve optimal outcomes There is also the need to ensure that strate
gies are sophisticated enough across government to meet the needs of
families who are facing adversity at a level of service provision appro
priate for the complexity of issues and importantly families have a voice
in this process

BACKGROUND Opioid use disorder is a leading cause of death
through the year postpartum
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to identify the association of neighbor
hood level social determinants of health and prenatal opioid use disorder
treatment receipt with the outcomes of medication treatment for opioid use
disorder through the year postpaitum among a cohort of birthing people
STUDY DESIGN This was a population based retrospective
study that used state Medicaid claims and enrollment data for the
individuals who delivered a live infant between July and Decem
ber and received medication for opioid use disorder at delivery
The primary exposure was the state Health Opportunity Index a composite
measure of social determinants of health linked at the census tract level
Secondary exposures included comprehensiveness of opioid use disorder
treatment and duration of medication treatment for opioid use disorder
received prenatally Outcomes included the duration and continuity of
postpartum medication treatment for opioid use disorder operationalized
as the time from delivery to the discontinuation of medication treatment
for opioid use disorder and percentage of days covered by medication
treatment for opioid use disorder within the months after delivery
respectively
RESULTS Within the study sample deliveries were to billhing
people in the lowest state Health OppMunity Index tercile indicating high
burden of negative social determinants of health in the middle state
Health Opportunity Index tercile and in the highest state Health
Opportunity Index tercile Using stepwise multivariable regression Cox
proportional hazards and negative binomial models guided by a socioeco
logical framework prenatal receipt of more comprehensive opioid use dis
order treatment and or longer duration of prenatal medication treatment
for opioid use disorder was associated with improved year postpartum

Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to identify the association of neighborhood level social deter
minants of health and prenatal opioid use disorder treatment receipt with medi
cation treatment outcomes for opioid use disorder through the year postpartum
among a cohort of birthing people
Key findings
This retrospective cohort study linked Medicaid claims with a cen
sus tract level measure of social determinants for members receiving medi
cation for opioid use disorder at delivery N Prenatal receipt of more
comprehensive opioid use disorder treatment and or longer duration of prenatal
medication treatment for opioid use disorder was associated with improved
year postpartum outcomes of opioid use disorder medication treatment across
neighborhood levels of social determinants
What does this add to what is known
To improve outcomes of postpartum people with opioid use disorder interven
tions should prioritize the expansion of medication treatments and targeting of
neighborhood level social determinants
Opportunity Index HOI We hypoth
esized that the neighborhood level
SDoH for the birthing person as mea
sured by the HOI along with the
degree of prenatal MOUD would be
associated with improved postpartum
MOUD outcomes

Outcome measures
The primary outcomes were postpar
tum MOUD duration and continuity of
MOUD receipt MOUD was captured
by pharmacy claims ie buprenorphine
and procedure codes ie methadone
MOUD duration was operationalized as
the number of days to first MOUD dis
continuity after delivery allowing for
up to a day gap between MOUD
claim dates An allowable day gap
was intentionally selected on the basis
of clinical experience and to account for
mistiming of claims to medication pro
vision If individuals switched between
MOUD type this was not considered a
gap nor discontinuation In addition
overlapping pharmacy claims dates
were considered to allow for surplus
days supplies to accumulate ie shifting
refill date forward for early refills
MOUD continuity was operationalized
as the cumulative number of days cov
ered by MOUD divided by the cumula
tive number of days enrolled in full
benefit Medicaid within the months
after delivery

Hg and lead Pb are well known environmental heavy metal loid s
that top the list of priority hazardous substances in the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry ATSDR
ATSDR
They are recognized as toxic during critical windows of
fetal and infant development and may cause intrauterine growth re
striction and fetal loss
A number of studies of populations in areas with very high en
vironmental levels of As and Cd such as Bangladesh India Japan
China and Chile have shown adverse associations between prenatal
exposure to As and or Cd and birth outcomes including reductions in
birth weight length and head circumference placental weight and
gestational age Saleh et al Esteban Vasallo et al
Kippier et al Laine et al Lin et al Menai
et al Milton et al Quansah et al sun et al
Zhang et al
and a higher risk of preterm delivery Milton et al
Rahman et al Yang et al and SGA
Saleh et al
However few data have been published on
Menai et al
the developmental effects of low to moderate As and Cd exposure
Quansah et al
Although epidemiological studies increasingly support the associa
tion of in utero exposure to Pb and Hg with adverse pregnancy out
comes the evidence is less consistent than for As and Cd especially in
the case of Hg Vrijheid et al Results of studies in populations
with different environmental Pb exposure levels have not been con
clusive in relation to birth size Saleh et al Esteban Vasallo

Conflicting findings have also been observed for Hg and an association
of prenatal exposure to moderate Hg levels with preterm delivery and
reduced size at birth has been found by some authors Saleh et al
Gundacker et al Karagas et al Vigeh et al
but not by others Bashore et al Drouillet
Xue et al
Pinard et al Guo et al Karagas et al
Some essential metals such as manganese Mn and chromium Cr
can also be toxic to humans if present at high levels Excessive prenatal
exposure to Mn has mainly been associated with neurodevelopmental
delay in children Rodriguez Barranco et al However there has
been little research into the effects of prenatal Mn exposure on birth
outcomes and conflicting findings have been published on the asso
ciation with birth size and gestational age
et al Tsai
et al Vigeh et al Zota et al
Likewise there has
been scant investigation of the effects on fetal growth of excessive Cr
levels during pregnancy however two recent studies associated higher
maternal Cr exposure with increased risk of LBW
Xia et al and
preterm delivery
Pan et al
As Pb and Hg can readily pass through the placental barrier from
the maternal bloodstream into the fetal circulation Iyengar and Rapp
as is also the case for Mn Krachler et al and Cr Ziaee
et al
while the placenta is only a partial barrier to the transfer
of Cd
Esteban Vasallo et al Once they have reached the pla
centa these metallic metalloid elements may interfere with placental
transport systems and enzymes affecting the normal placental function
Esteban Vasallo et al Thus given the role of the placenta as a
mediator in the transfer of nutrients and contaminants to the fetus
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
placental biomarkers may provide valuable information on intrauterine
exposure to these potentially toxic elements Moreover the placenta is
readily available and provides information on the exposure of both
mother and fetus Esteban Vasallo et al However few studies
have used the placenta to assess prenatal exposure to metals such as As
Hg or Mn in relation to birth outcomes
Saleh et al
Esteban Vasallo et al
Previous data from the INMA INfancia y Medio Ambiente
Environment and Childhood Project a birth cohort study in Spain
showed that total Hg level in cord blood from newborns was
inversely associated with placental weight and head circumference but
not with the length of gestation Murcia et al Cord blood total
Hg was also associated with a reduced biparietal diameter at weeks
of pregnancy Ballester et al With the above background this
study aimed to examine the association of placental As Cd Pb Hg Mn
and Cr concentrations with birth weight and length head cir
cumference LBW gestational age at birth preterm delivery and SGA in
a sub sample of mother child pairs from the INMA Project There is
increasing evidence that the sex of the newborn may modify the asso
ciation of prenatal exposure to toxic metals with birth outcomes
Kippler et al Lamichhane et al Wang et al
Xia et al and subsequent neurodevelopmental effects
Llop et al However studies on the sex specific effects of pre
natal metal exposure on birth outcomes remain scarce and their results
are controversial Therefore the potential role of sex as modifier of the
studied associations was also evaluated

in Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and Valencia but at birth
in Granada with a total of babies born to women in
these cohorts All cohorts included male and female newborns except
for Granada which recruited only male newborns The details of the
INMA Project including methods of recruitment and enrollment have
been previously reported Guxens et al Out of the placentas
collected were randomly selected for metal content ana
lysis The present study included mother infant pairs with available
data on placental metal levels anthropometrical measures gestational
age at birth and relevant covariates Information on head cir
cumference was only available for newborns All procedures as
sociated with the INMA study were approved by the institutional re
view boards of the participating centers
Laboratory analysis
The processing of placentas and the analytical and quality control
procedures used to determine metal concentrations are reported else

Amaya et al Gil et al
Briefly half of the placenta
including maternal and fetal sides as well as central and peripheral
parts was homogenized to ensure homogeneity of the placental tissue
Cd Pb Mn and Cr concentrations in placenta homogenates were de
termined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry using an
AAnalyst Atomic Absorption Spectrometer Perkin Elmer Nor
walk CT equipped with Zeeman background correction system and

AS auto sampler Total As content was determined in a hydride
generation atomic absorption spectrometer Perkin Elmer FIAS IOO
and total Hg content in a Perkin Elmer Atomic Absorption Spec

Birth outcomes
Data on neonatal anthropometric measurements birth weight in g
and birth length and head circumference in cm were obtained by the
attending midwife or nurse Gestational age was calculated as the
number of weeks from the self reported last menstrual period to the end
of pregnancy In Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and Valencia cohorts
early fetal crown rump length measurement by ultrasound was used to
correct gestational age when the two estimations differed by days or
Murcia et al LBW was defined by a birth weight of
more
less than gat term and preterm birth by live birth before
weeks of pregnancy Newborns were defined as SGA when below the
percentile of the expected weight according to the Spanish birth
weight curve adjusted for gestational age and sex Carrascosa et al
Confounding variables
Socio demographics and lifestyle data were collected by inter
viewer administered questionnaires during the and trimesters of
pregnancy Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and Valencia cohorts or at
the birth Granada cohort Information on the type of delivery ce
sarean or vaginal was obtained from clinical records Variables con
sidered as potential confounders in this study were newborn sex co
hort maternal age maternal and father s education level at delivery
primary secondary or university schooling maternal smoking during
pregnancy yes or no maternal working during pregnancy yes or no
pre pregnancy body mass index BMI parity or and ma
ternal place of residence during pregnancy rural or urban sub urban
Pre pregnancy BMI was obtained by dividing self reported pre preg
nancy weight in kg by the square of the current height and categorized
as underweight normal weight kg or overweight obese
kg Confounding assessment also included parental social
class considering the higher classified maternal or father s occupation
during the pregnancy Social class was categorized as classes I II
higher classes III other non manual classes or IV V manual
classes Additionally the average of mean daily intakes of fish and
seafood reported at and weeks of gestation adjusted for total
caloric intake was considered as the daily intake in g day during the
pregnancy Information on food intake frequency during pregnancy was
gathered from the women in the Asturias Gipuzkoa Sabadell and
Valencia cohorts using a validated semiquantitative questionnaire of
food items Vioque et al Fish intake during pregnancy is
known to be a potential source of fetal exposure to toxic metals
Herreros et al However fish is also a rich source of proteins
vitamins iron and long chain unsaturated fatty acids and its intake
during pregnancy might protect against metal toxicity and adverse birth
outcomes Murcia et al Olsen and Secher
Statistical analysis
Concentrations of As Hg and Pb were below the LD in a high
proportion of samples Therefore we did not impute values LD of
the assays for placental levels of these metals and they were
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
categorized as detected or undetected Cd concentrations LD
of placentas were assigned a value one half of the LD Descriptive data
on placental metal content are shown as detection frequencies median
values and and percentiles of concentrations Spearman s
correlation test was used to assess relationships between Cd Mn and Cr
levels For birth outcomes absolute and relative frequency mean
median and and percentiles were used for descriptive pur
poses Associations of parental characteristics and newborn sex with
birth weight and length gestational age and SGA were examined by
univariate linear and logistic regression and those showing an asso
ciation at p entered a multivariate regression model to identify
predictors of each outcome Variables were retained in the multivariate
model if associated at p with the outcome The covariates as
sociated with birth weight in the multivariate model were newborn sex
maternal smoking or working during pregnancy and pre pregnancy
BMI those associated with birth length were newborn sex and cohort
and those associated with head circumference were newborn sex and
maternal smoking during pregnancy Maternal education alone was a
significant predictor of gestational age while the father s education
maternal working during pregnancy and the variable cohort remained
associated with SGA
Adjusted linear regression models were created to assess the asso
ciation of metal levels with anthropometric parameters and gestational
age at birth Associations with binary outcomes LBW preterm de
livery and SGA were explored by logistic regression Models were
adjusted for outcome predictors and cohort and simultaneously ad
justed for all metals Because a reduction in gestation length is a major
determinant of birth weight models with birth weight LBW birth
length and head circumference were additionally adjusted for gesta
tional age The change in estimate criterion was used to select
confounders for each outcome retaining variables in the final model if
they modified the effect of metal level on outcome b regression coef
ficient by LBW and preterm delivery models were adjusted for
the same covariates as those included in birth weight and gestational
age models respectively Cd Mn and Cr concentrations showed
skewed distributions and were therefore transformed into natural
logarithms before regression analyses Random effect models were used
to report final estimates from the main and sex stratified analyses to
account for the heterogeneity among cohorts Table and
Table
Estimates of models with Cd Mn and Cr and continuous outcomes are
reported as change in outcome for each increase in metal level
while results for logistic regression models are reported as the odds of
each outcome for every increase in placental levels of Cd Mn or
Cr All linear regression models were tested for multicollinearity by
variance inflation factor VIF using a cutoff of and for outliers by
standardized residuals and for potential influential observations Cook s
distance
In order to explore nonlinear associations of metal levels with birth
weight and length head circumference and gestation age further re
gression analyses were conducted with Cd Mn and Cr categorized in
tertiles and with Hg grouped as LD between LD and median de
tected value and above this median The likelihood ratio test was
performed to test the significance of linear trends across tertiles cate
gories of metal levels The effect modification by sex was evaluated by
interaction terms and stratified regression models Generalized additive
models GAMs were also used to evaluate the linearity of the re
lationships of Cd Mn and Cr with continuous outcomes comparing
linear and nonlinear models by using Akaike Information Criteria AIC
GAMs were fitted with the mgcv library of R using penalized thin plate
regression splines as smoothing functions and the default basis di
mension k In a final sensitivity analysis associations with birth
size LBW and SGA were examined after excluding preterm births and
the potential confounding of maternal fish intake was assessed in a sub
sample of women with data available on dietary intake during preg
nancy N R statistical software version fmsb mtest and
mgcv libraries was used for the data analyses
