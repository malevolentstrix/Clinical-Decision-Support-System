Results and discussion
We evaluated peer reviewed studies that addressed drinking
water iAs and birth weight Table nine studies that captured
gestational age
and five studies that addressed birth size
Table
Table Many studies captured multiple endpoints and most were
conducted among populations residing in the so called arsenic
endemic regions of India Bangladesh China and Taiwan where
drinking water iAs contamination is high widespread and well
known
Epidemiologic studies in South Asia
India
Approximately persons residing in the West Bengal
region of the Ganga Plain in eastern India may be at risk for expo
sure to iAs in ground water at levels of pg L Nordstrom
Large scale contamination also occurs in other Ganga Plain
India locales including Bihar Chakraborti et al Yet only
three published cross sectional studies assessed the impact on
birth outcomes in India This work was completed in the context
of large drinking water surveys conducted in the West Bengal and
Bihar regions where women employed sources contaminated by

icant birth weight associations were detected using a second set

and inconsistent results across exposure metrics undermines the
impact of the positive result
A much larger prospective study was conducted on
Bangladeshi women with singleton pregnancies and participating
in an ongoing maternal and infant nutrition intervention study
Rahman et al Urine specimens were collected from moth
ers at eight and weeks gestation Birth outcomes were assessed
using records stored by local health centers and augmented by

of participants with biologic measures averaging exposure across
early and late gestation to accommodate changes in water source
or dietary exposures in addition to adjusting for a comprehen
Sive panel of confounding variables Effects were observed only for
women with lower iAs exposures raising the possibility of a com
peting pregnancy loss risk at higher exposures or an enhancing of
birth weight at iAs pg L by chance only
Epidemiologic studies in East Asia
China and Taiwan
Up to individuals residing in Inner Mongolia China
and residing in Taiwan are at risk for exposure to to
pg L iAs and pg L iAs respectively in contaminated
drinking water sources Nordstrom Yet we identified only
one cross sectional study of birth outcomes in an arsenic endemic
region of Inner Mongolia and one prospective cohort study of birth
outcomes conducted in an arsenic endemic region of Taiwan Two
additional cross sectional studies were conducted in China and one
in Taiwan in areas without recognized groundwater iAs contami
nation
A large cross sectional investigation conducted in Inner
Mongolia assessed singleton deliveries in women using
maternal and newborn health records stored by local clinics Myers
et al
This area is known for groundwater iAs contamina
tion and the investigators sampled water from wells suspected
of contamination Term infants born to mothers consuming water
contaminated by IOO pg L iAs were g heavier CI

which is likely to have misclassified exposure for some women
An exposure validation substudy conducted among cor
roborates the likelihood In fact the investigators were unable to
link more than half of the women to exposure data as they were
presumed to employ uncontaminated wells Women without expo
sure data were more likely to be primigravid and to have received
adequate prenatal care and so a bias may have been introduced
Again limiting the birth weight analysis to full term deliveries may
have introduced a collider stratification or over adjustment bias as
described earlier
A very large prospective study conducted in northeastern
Taiwan captured more than primiparous singleton deliver

Yang et al Using registry data investigators compared
birth weights and gestational age at delivery between women

modest and not of statistical significance Though the sample size
was large the ecologic exposure assessment i e exposed vs
unexposed is expected to have introduced exposure measure
ment misclassification error into the study results Despite what
was likely to be a consequent bias toward the null hypothesis
the authors identified a small but statistically significant decrease
in birth weight suggesting that the true underlying effect may
in fact be larger than that reported Still regional comparisons
might reflect sociodemographic differences between groups and
although the authors matched by a village urbanization index and
adjusted their analysis for years of formal education residual con
founding remains a possibility
Two additional cross sectional studies were conducted in areas
of China without recognized groundwater iAs contamination In
one investigators recruited and interviewed women with sin
gleton pregnancies receiving prenatal care at one of two Shanghai
City hospitals Xu et al Total arsenic was measured in mater

Though the authors of these cross sectional studies employed
hospital delivery records and biomarkers of exposure the use of
total blood arsenic raises concern Guan et al Xu et al
Total blood arsenic incorporates both iAs as well as the compara
tively non toxic organic arsenic species Akter et al to which
humans are exposed when consuming seafood Le et al
Navas Acien et al This approach is likely to misclassify
exposure in particular for frequent seafood consumers
Marchiset
Ferlay et al and might introduce positive confounding
by reproductive toxicants also found in seafood Bushkin Bedient
and Carpenter such as persistent organohalogen pollu
tants or mercury Wigle et al driving associations away
from the null hypothesis In contrast confounding by benefi
Cial agents in seafood such as n fatty acids et al
are anticipated to negatively confound associations toward
the null hypothesis Furthermore arsenic is cleared from the
blood in a few hours and therefore is not recommended as a
biomarker for exposure particularly at low levels of exposure
ATSDR
A large prospective cohort study was conducted on
women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies and attending
an obstetrics clinic in an area of central Taiwan without groundwa
ter iAs contamination Chou et al Women were interviewed

on the iAs birth outcomes association in that group data were

dows of vulnerability Buck Louis et al as iAs has a half life
of approximately h ATSDR and metabolic efficiency

study results toward the null hypothesis
Japan

Japan a non arsenic endemic area Shirai et al The authors
recruited pregnant women receiving prenatal care in gestational
weeks from a single hospital and determined total arsenic in
spot urine specimens The geometric mean was gg g creati

Table
Table adjusted for maternal age and BMI cigarette smoking
and gestational age at delivery Though prospective in nature and
with person level exposure assessment as well as adjustment for
confounding variables this small study was likely underpowered to
detect associations given the low levels of exposure Furthermore
the use of a total arsenic biomarker in a population of frequent
seafood consumers coupled to the timing of urine collection for
some participants predisposed the results to the aforementioned
biases and confounding by additional related reproductive toxi
cants
Epidemiologic studies in South America and Europe
Chile
Prior to the implementation of drinking water iAs mitigation
technologies in the approximately individuals were
exposed to pg L IAS in Chile Nordstrom although
the population currently at risk is difficult to ascertain Bundschuh
We identified one prospective cohort study conducted
et al
in an arsenic endemic region of northern Chile
Employing the public health care system in Chile pregnant
women were recruited to a prospective study during prenatal
care visits at weeks gestation Hopenhayn et al
Women had resided for a minimum of months in the city of
Antofagasta which was supplied by water sources contaminated by
gg L iAs or in the city of Valparaiso which was supplied
by comparatively uncontaminated water sources pg L
iAs The average urine total iAs concentration was approximately
fold higher among women residing in Antofagasta pg L
than in Valparaiso gg L A non significant g CI
decrease in newborn birth weight was reported per pg L
increase in maternal urine iAs Table Compared by city of resi
dence average birth weights were g CI lower
for Antofagasta neonates compared to Valparaiso neonates and
g lower when restricted to infants with
weeks completed gestation at delivery although not of statisti
cal significance The authors adjusted for maternal age BMI height
and parity cigarette smoking gestational age at delivery cigarette
smoking household income prenatal care and newborn sex The
ecologic exposure assignment strategy suggested a decreased birth
weight in association with higher maternal drinking water iAs
but the results were not statistically significant and the individual
exposure assessment approach indicated no association however
the direction of the effect estimates was consistent Collection of
biospecimens later in pregnancy was likely to have introduced
exposure measurement misclassification into the study results
with an ensuing bias toward the null hypothesis and thus might
account for the non significant birth weight decrease However
the sample size was large outcomes were abstracted from clinical
records and confounding variables were considered
Romania and Spain
Approximately people are exposed to as much as
gg L iAs in Hungary and western Romania and more than
Spaniards are likely exposed to up to pg L iAs
Nordstrom We identified one cross sectional study con
ducted in an arsenic endemic region of western Romania While
we found one study conducted on the Spanish Tenerife Island this
area is not known for groundwater iAs contamination
A recent cross sectional study described women residing
in Arad County Romania with uncomplicated full term single
ton deliveries in the previous years and having resided in the
M S Bloom et al International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
same locale for at least years Gelmann et al
Women
were recruited from four villages with known drinking ground
water iAs contamination IO pg L and four villages accessing
uncontaminated water sources pg L Data were captured by
personal interview and drinking water urine and toenail specimens
were collected Although no association was reported for drinking
water iAs and birth weight Table women with a LBW delivery
were significantly more likely to have had the sum of
urine iAs and its metabolites pg L compared to women
with a normal birth weight delivery Ratios of iAs metabo
lites in urine methylarsonate MMA and dimethylarsinate DMA
were used to identify women with higher and lower rates of iAs
metabolism Vahter and Concha Yet these were not associ
ated with birth weight nor were toenail iAs The results suggested
that mothers with a history of LBW were less likely to partition iAs
internally than mothers without LBW and that factors in addition to
metabolism may designate women to higher risk for adverse birth
outcomes in association with iAs exposure Gelmann et al
However the small sample size was unlikely to be sufficiently pow
ered to detect subtle differences in drinking water iAs in particular
at the low levels measured in this study The comparisons were
not adjusted for confounding variables although bivariate anal
ysis suggested that the groups were mostly similar in terms of
sociodemographic factors and health related behaviors Still the
cross sectional nature of this study precludes temporality coupled
to the short half life of iAs which as noted earlier introduces poten
tial exposure measurement misclassification error especially for
older deliveries
Another recent cross sectional study conducted in Tenerife
Spain described women and their newborns with mater
nal completion of a structured questionnaire and collection of
meconium from newborn diapers with total arsenic analysis
Vail
et al
Arsenic was detected in meconium specimens
ng g presumably representing cumulative exposure
starting in the week of gestation Babies n with
detectable arsenic were heavier on average than those
without P
Table although gestational ages n
were similar
Yet meconium arsenic concen
Table
tration was unrelated to reported maternal drinking water source
P As noted above for populations with low drinking water
iAs exposure and high rates of seafood consumption total arsenic
most likely reflects dietary exposure to the innocuous organic
arsenic species Furthermore the latter likely results in confound
ing by additional unmeasured agents found in seafood that may
have positively or negatively confounded the associations
Synthesis
Whereas the evidence from animal and in vitro studies provides
sufficient biologic plausibility for iAs as a reproductive toxicant
the evidence from the epidemiologic literature is inconsistent
We noted wide variation in the quality and rigor of the stud
ies reviewed particularly in terms of sample size study design
exposure assessment strategies and adjustment for confounding
Furthermore differences exist in populations studied in terms of
residence in IAS or non iAs endemic regions and thus the extent of
exposure through consumption of contaminated drinking water
Exposure to iAs decreased birth weight in some studies
Chakraborti et al Guan et al Huyck et al Xu
et al including in two large high quality prospective inves
tigations Rahman et al Yang et al A decrease was
suggested although not detected in another large and high quality
prospective study Hopenhayn et al In contrast no effect
or an increase in birth weight was reported in several other studies
Ahamed et al Chakraborti et al Chou et al
Gelmann et al Mukherjee et al Shirai et al
Vail et al
including two large cross sectional studies of high
quality
Kwok et al Myers et al Based on our review
of the literature we conclude that insufficient epidemiologic evi
dence exists to corroborate an increase in LBW as a clinical outcome
However there exists limited evidence for a continuous decrease
in birth weight across the distribution but also some evidence for
an increase with iAs
Very few studies detected associations between gestational
age and drinking water iAs with only two reports of significant
decreases reported from cross sectional investigations Ahmad
et al xu et al
In contrast two very large studies
conducted in arsenic endemic areas one cross sectional Myers
et al
and one prospective Yang et al reported no
association for drinking water iAs and gestational age in popula
tions with exposure to drinking water sources contaminated by
well over pg L iAs Based on our review of the epidemiologic
evidence published to date we conclude that insufficient evidence
exists for a causal association between drinking water iAs exposure
and gestational age However as the number of studies capturing
gestational age was limited a potential association cannot be ruled
out
Few investigations incorporated measures of birth size as
study endpoints A large well conducted prospective cohort study
reported significantly decreased head and chest circumference
with a borderline significant decrease in birth length among
infants delivered to mothers residing in an iAs endemic region
of Bangladesh Rahman et al and significant decreases
for head circumference chest circumference and birth length
were reported from a small cross sectional study conducted in a
non iAs endemic region of China Guan et al Three addi
tional studies did not report significant cross sectional associations
among populations residing in non iAs endemic regions However
the effect estimates for one study were quite strong although
imprecise Chou et al no effect estimates were reported
for another Shirai et al and exposure assessment issues
limit the interpretability of the results from the third Vall et al
Therefore we suggest there that minimal evidence exists for
a causal association between maternal drinking water iAs exposure
and reduced birth size
Recommendations
Several salient methodologic issues limit the studies we
reviewed herein and might account at least in part for the inconsis
tency ofthe reported results or likewise have biased results toward
the null hypothesis and obscured associations However investi
gations of populations exposed to high levels of drinking water
iAs were often conducted in underdeveloped regions introduc
ing practical and financial limitations into study designs Still it
seems constructive to discuss issues for consideration in future
study design to more conclusively assess risks In addition to the
methodologic limitations raised earlier variable susceptibility to
iAs toxicity dietary sources of iAs exposure and paternal effects
may also be important Consideration of these issues will require
attention to further clarify the impact of drinking water iAs expo
sure in future investigation of birth weight and birth size
Vulnerability to the toxic effects of iAs varies substantially
between pregnant women independent of gestational length Li
et al
and overlooking this issue may overshadow or oth
erwise bias associations between maternal iAs exposure and birth
outcomes Several factors including polymorphisms in the
and MTHFR genes Lindberg et al and nutritional status
for folate glutathione and methionine Vahter impact the
metabolism of iAs Adjustment for maternal BMI or height can

the active transmission of Zika in
Puerto Rico Between and
nearly pregnant women were
reported to have Zika I which can
cause microcephaly and other birth
defects in infants born to women
infected during pregnancy Thus there
was an urgent need to gather
information on Zika related experien
ces and behaviors during pregnancy
Although PRDH declared the end of the
Zika outbreak in June Zika sur
veillance continued administrative
orders remained in place for continued
testing of pregnant women and use of
protective measures were still
recommended during pregnancy
Phase allowed continued assessment
of maternal behaviors and added the

a The telephone follow up surveys gathered supplemental data to address emerging data needs identified as the Zika outbreak progressed The phase
telephone follow up survey was implemented approximately months after birth because of time needed to identify gaps develop surveys and
protocols and obtain necessary approvals Streamlining of methods during phase allowed for implementation of the telephone follow up survey
approximately months after birth
maternal and infant postpartum health
and behaviors that could not be
assessed at the time of delivery
The landfall of Hurricanes Irma and
Marfa posed new chal enges to pregnant
and postpartum women The PRAMS
ZPER study was in a unique position to
collect data about experiences in the
aftermath of the disaster and was lever
aged for that purpose by including
hurricane related questions The
in hosp tal data collection also allowed
PRDH to incorporate an educational
component to reinforce public health
messaging for postpartum women and
families
IMPLEMENTATION
Data from Puerto Rico s Demographic
Registry were used to identify hospitals
Sampling hospitals were selected
based on the number of births during
the previous year Hospitals with or
more births in were eligible for
participation during phase and hos
pitals with or more births in
were eligible for participation during
phase PRDH contacted selected
hospitals to complete the study s
participation agreement In phase
all eligible hospitals participated
representing of live births on
the island during the sampling period
In phase of eligible hospitals
participated representing of
births For this phase one hospital
declined participation and three hospi
tals were not included because their
maternity wards were closed after Hur
ricane Marfa
For phase the sampling design was
stratified by the island s eight health
regions Regional oversampling was not
performed for phase because of the
shortened data collection timeframe
after the hurricanes Table For both
phases probability sampling was used
to identify the sampling days in each
hospital All eligible women with a live
birth on sampled days were invited to
participate
For phase study personnel
approached women or hours
after vaginal or cesarean section deliv
ery respectively Approximately
women were identified to have been
discharged before they could be invited
to participate For phase women
were approached soon after delivery
because of the likelihood of early dis
charge e g hours after the hurri
cane For phase we were unable to
assess the number of women who
were discharged before being con
tacted by study personnel In hospital
surveys were self administered on
paper or electronic tablets with most
completed on tablets during

phase For phase most
surveys were completed on paper
because of delays in tablet availability
For the paternal survey fathers were
approached soon after the birth and
before maternal discharge For all sur
veys respondents received a small gift
for their participation Table and
Respondents characteristics are shown

After completing the in hospital sur

offered the educational component
which included a minute interactive
flip chart presentation addressing post
partum health newborn care and Zika
prevention Supplemental educational
materials on breastfeeding infant care
postpartum care and mental health
and CDC s Developmental Milestones
booklet were integrated into the pre
sentation A notepad and pen were
provided to participants to write down
any questions that the study staff were
unable to answer for later follow up
with hospital staff
After completing the in hospital data
collection PRDH performed a determin
iStic linkage of samp ed mothers to birth
certificate records Among respondents
linkage rates were and for
phase and respectively Linkage to
birth certificate data provided contact
information for telephone follow up
and allowed inclusion of select birth
certificate variables Table B available

analytic data sets Birth certificate data
were also used for data weighting Data
were weighted for stratified sampling
design and to adjust for differential

protocol proceduress were followed for
the telephone follow up surveys

ADVERSE EFFECTS
We have no adverse effects to report
SUSTAINABILITY
Implementing the PRAMS ZPER study
during two types of public health emer
gencies infectious disease outbreak and
natural disaster was labor intensive and
logistically challenging because of evolv
ing data needs and operational limita
tions During phase it was necessary
OPINIONS IDEAS PRACTICE
to rapidly adapt questionnaires proto
cols and implementation guidelines
after the hurricanes However phase
response rates exceeded the already
h gh rates obtained in phase by
decreasing the length of the data collec
tion period removing wait time require
ments for contacting mothers providing
extensive interviewer training imple
menting a feasibility pilot study including
staff in project planning and maintaining
