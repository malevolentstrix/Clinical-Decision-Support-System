tion is inevitably lost with handwritten notes Additionally we pre
sented primarily qualitative over quantitative data to provide the
most insight and guidance for future application Strengths of our
study include that the interviews were open ended both first and
senior authors trained and worked in a religious setting so were
knowledgeable on the topic and the senior author conducted all
interviews for consistency
The extent to which religious programs employed work arounds
reduced the need to seek offsite collaborations While this resulted
in improved training experiences this finding reemphasizes the
moral and clinical ambiguities that occur when Catholic programs
attempt to balance the directives and accreditation requirements
simultaneously These findings also highlight the varying de
grees to which Catholic hospitals follow the directives and the im
pact this has on both patient care and resident training These
findings demonstrate the many educational and ethical dilemmas

BACKGROUND The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine uses social
media to increase awareness of the Society and its key programs and to
foster community and discussion around perinatal health especially on
Twitter The influence and role of the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Twitter account in public discourse around issues relevant to pregnancy
have not been studied
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the trends in engagement
with the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine on Twitter by analyzing Soci
ety for Maternal Fetal Medicine follower growth and discussion topics on
Twitter compared with Facebook and by quantifying public engagement
during the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting
STUDY DESIGN This retrospective study analyzed follower growth data
from August to July for the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Twitter MySMFM and Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Facebook
SocietyforMaternalFetalMedicine accounts We identified the top
tweets and Facebook posts during the study period using Twitter Analytics
and Facebook data The popularity of tweets and Facebook posts was deter
mined by impressions and reach respectively these metrics reflect the
number of times a post was viewed To evaluate annual trends in Society
for Maternal Fetal Medicine Twitter engagement we analyzed data associ
ated with the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meet
ing including the number of tweets using the hashtag SMFM Year and
overall impressions for the Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine Twitter
RESULTS The absolute number of new followers for the Society for
Maternal Fetal Medicine Twitter and Facebook accounts was similar
but the relative increase and rate of follower growth was higher for
Twitter than for Facebook The Twitter account consistently gained fol
lowers whereas the Facebook account experienced intermittent peri
ods of stagnancy or follower loss More than half of the top ranked
posts on Twitter and Facebook mentioned the COVID vaccine other
popular topics included COVID and abortion During the Society for
Maternal Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting the number of
tweets using the meeting hashtag consistently peaked on meeting day
coincident with the opening plenary session mean An
upward trend in annual pregnancy meeting tweets was observed each
year until the first virtual Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
meeting
CONCLUSION The trends in Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Twitter engagement suggest increasing use and popularity of the platform
for timely dissemination of pregnancy related news guidelines and
research The reduction in annual pregnancy meeting tweets and impres
sions in and suggests the potential negative effect of villual
meetings on Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine member engagement

Among social media platforms Twitter
has emerged as a popular platform for

is fundamental to advancing the mission
of SMFM however the efficacy of social
media efforts to attract wide audiences
and encourage interaction with trending

Why was this study conducted
The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine SMFM uses social media to increase
awareness of the society its members and its key programs This study aimed to
evaluate the trends in engagement with SMFM on Twitter and Facebook
Key findings
The SMFM Twitter account following has grown steadily over the past years at
a faster rate than Facebook COVID related posts garnered the most engage
ment on both platforms throughout the study
What does this add to what is known
Social media engagement around the SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meeting
increased annually until and when the meeting was held virtually
Our findings suggest that Twitter is an important tool for real time dissemina
tion and discussion of pregnancy related research
study quantified trends in engagement
with the SMFM around SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting by examining the
usage of the meeting hashtag during the
weeks surrounding the conference We
predicted that growth in SMFM Twitter
followers would surpass the rate of
growth for Facebook and that the virtual
format of the annual pregnancy meeting
in and would result in an
increase in meeting related tweets
Materials and Methods
Study design

Content data
The top SMFM posts on Twitter and
Facebook January to July
were identified using platform specific
metrics For Twitter popular posts were
determined by the number of impres
sions Impressions are defined as the
total number of times a tweet appears
on a timeline or search result Post
impressions reflect the level of expo
sure to content which has been found
to be a more significant predictor of
post influence than the number of likes
comments or retweets of each post
For Facebook top posts were deter
mined using SMFM s Facebook account
Insights part of the normal Facebook
analytical data The posts were ranked
by reach or the number of people who
saw the SMFM posts at least once Simi
lar to Twitter impressions Facebook s
reach data reflect exposure to content
Post categories were determined by
identifying common terms or hashtags
used in the top ranked posts for each
platform
Twitter engagement during the
Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine
Annual Pregnancy Meeting
We quantified SMFM meeting related
Tweets around the annual pregnancy
meeting to evaluate the level of social
media engagement during a period when
member engagement is anticipated to be
high We used the social media analyt
ics platform Sprout Social to identify
the number of daily tweets containing
the meeting hashtag SMFMYY or
SMFMYYYY around the time of the
annual pregnancy meeting for each
meeting from to We exam
ined a week timeframe from week
before day of the meeting to week
after day to capture the period when
the use of the meeting hashtag is
expected to be the highest Sprout Social
is a comprehensive social media man
agement platform that tracks the total
number of tweets engagements and
more over time to provide insights into
online engagement To estimate the
audience of the MySMFM Twitter
account during the same period we used
Twitter Analytics to collect data on the
total number of MySMFM tweet
impressions We compared these data
with the total volume of meeting related
tweets collected via Sprout Social during
the same period
Data analysis and statistics
Trends in follower growth were deter
mined using a linear regression model
and the slopes for Twitter and Facebook
growth from to were com
pared The number of SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting related tweets was
calculated for each day of the confer
ence from to To determine
trends in Twitter activity we compared
the total number of tweets and impres
sions from day to day of the annual
pregnancy meeting for each year The
total number of impressions was nor
malized to the total number of tweets
given an expected proportional relation
ship between the variables Data
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
version GraphPad Software La
Jolla CA
Results
At the beginning of the study period
the SMFM Twitter account had
followers whereas the Facebook
account had followers Between
August and July the number
of followers gained was slightly higher
for Twitter for Twitter vs
for Facebook This growth translated
to a relative increase of for Twitter
followers compared with for Face
book followers although the Facebook
account had more followers overall
for Facebook vs for
Twitter The rate of follower growth
was higher for Twitter slope for
Twitter vs for Facebook Figure I
Although Twitter followers increased
continuously for the entire study period
Facebook follower growth varied Sur
prisingly the Facebook page experi
enced a net loss of followers during
month November By compari
son SMFM society membership grew
from January to January
To identify the content that garnered
the most attention and engagement on
SMFM Twitter and Facebook we ana
lyzed the top posts on each platform
The most popular SMFM Twitter and
Facebook discussion topics were related
to the COVID pandemic Table
The topics identified were COVID
vaccines COVID abortion and
other all posts that did not fit into the
other categories COVID or the
COVID vaccine were the focus of
of the top tweets and of the top
Facebook posts
Next we evaluated social media
engagement around the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting Tweets using the
SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meeting
hashtag increased between days and
peak and were the highest on days
and corresponding to the main ple
nary sessions Figure A On average
there was almost a fold increase in
meeting related tweets between days
FIGURE
and eg during the SMFM
Annual Pregnancy Meeting there were
tweets on day compared with
tweets on day representing a
fold increase in tweets The number of
daily tweets during the meeting
increased markedly in compared
with vs on day but
then decreased in n the
first meeting ever held virtually because
of the COVID pandemic Day
tweet volume increased in
n virtual meeting and
n in person meeting but did
not recover to levels
Contrary to our hypothesis that the
virtual meeting format would increase
social media use approximately half as
many total meeting related tweets were
posted during the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting compared with the
SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meet
ing vs respectively Despite
the drop in tweet volume in over
all impressions that year were higher
vs in
Figure
B This finding reflects the multiple
variables that affect impressions such
as number of retweets likes and com
ments and who is engaging with the
content In the second virtual
meeting and in person meeting
there was a slight increase in the volume
of meeting related tweets and

registration
Comment
Principal findings
Our study evaluated trends in SMFM
social media growth and engagement
using Twitter and Facebook data We
found that SMFM Twitter follower
growth has surpassed Facebook follower
growth in recent years the most
popular content on both platforms
mentioned the COVID vaccine or
other COVID related topics and
tweets during the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting increased annually
until the shift to a virtual meeting for
mat in
Results in the context of what is
known
The finding that SMFM Twitter growth
has surpassed SMFM Facebook growth
since is not unexpected given the
ever changing landscape of social media
and the influence of demographic dif
ferences on platform preference and
usage Fluctuations in the popularity
of different social media platforms are
inevitable thus staying up to date with
social media trends is an important
component of an effective communica
tions strategy
Our observation that COVID vac
cine and disease related posts were
the most shared and seen content on
both platforms is evidence that social
media can effectively amplify crucial
and timely health information A recent
analysis of COVID related Twitter
discussions found that of message
functions information community
and action engagement through
retweets was most common with Tweets
that promoted action This trend was
also seen in the SMFM Twitter account
as the most popular tweet encouraged
pregnant people to get vaccinated In
addition the social isolation of the pan
demic increased reliance on social
media updates as a primary news

ABSTRACT
Background India has around high risk pregnant mothers which leads to about perinatal morbidities l The early prediction
of a high risk pregnancy and planning interventions can help in preventing complications and result in good pregnancy outcomes
Aims To study the pregnancy outcome among the high risk pregnant women of a rural area and to associate pregnancy outcomes
of high risk pregnant women with modified Coopland s criteria Material and Methods Study design I year Longitudinal study
from to Study population The high risk pregnant women attending PMSMA camp Study area Kinaye Primary Health
Centre Belagavi Sample size Data collection was done using a pretested predesigned questionnaire after obtaimng patient
consent and ethical clearance Chi square test was used to study the association of variables and categorical data presented as
percentages Results Among the participants of the pregnant women had low risk scores had high risk scores and
had severe risk scores according to Coopland s high risk pregnancy scoring Nearly high risk pregnancies resulted in
bad fetal outcomes As Coopland s score in the high risk group increased the chance of having good fetal outcomes decreased
and this association was found to be statistically significant Conclusions of the high risk mothers had good pregnancy
outcomes The scoring system can be used by health workers for the prediction of high risk pregnancy and plan treatment and
preventive measures
Keywords Belagavi High risk PMSMA pregnancy outcome
Introduction
High risk pregnancy H R P is defined as one which is
complicated by factor or factors that adversely affect the
pregnancy outcome maternal perinatal or both Identification
of such pregnancies which lead to poor outcome is the primary
aim in antenatal care A risk scoring system is very useful for
the detection of HRP as it often results in a bad maternal
and fetal outcome and extra care should be given especially

in developing countries like India Early prediction of such a
state severity and planning interventions can help in preventing
complications and thus reduce the maternal and infant mortality
rates and the incidence of low birth weight babies The Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare of India launched the Pradhan
Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan PMSMA in to provide
quality antenatal care services free of cost to all women in their
or trimesters of pregnancy at certain government health
facilities on the of every month This helps us in identifying
and tracking high risk pregnancies monthly antenatal checkups
by a specialist and treatment of complicated cases at all the
health centres thereby making the antenatal services more
approachable to all the pregnant women in all places including
the remote areas and rural places thus helping every mother
and child to have a safe delivery and healthy life by preventing

Regarding pregnancy outcome there were total of newborns
three abortions and two twin deliveries among whom
were male and were female The mode of delivery was
normal vaginal for pregnant women and Caesarean for
Most of the mothers preferred private
hospitals for delivery whereas preferred Government
hospitals and one of them had home delivery
Comparison of pregnancy outcome of the high
risk pregnancies had good a fetal outcome and had
bad outcomes
Full term vaginal delivery with single live birth with an immediate
cry and normal weight without complications was considered
a good outcome There were total bad fetal outcomes as
shown in Figure
The majority of the good fetal outcomes
were seen in the low risk group followed by the high risk
The association between the pregnancy risk
group and the fetal outcome was found to be statistically
significant P Table
Various steps were taken by the health workers to identify
at risk pregnant mothers and provide timely adequate treatment
affecting the overall pregnancy outcome Some of the preventive
practices are as shown in Figure
Discussion
In the present study the majority of the mothers were in
the age group of to years years were
of the participant was the elderly primigravida In a similar study
conducted in central India among women the majority of
the mothers were in the age group of to years while
the remaining were in the age group of or years
In another study done in Nagpur were in the age
group of to years and were teenagers In
our study of the study participants had child marriage
and nearly of the mothers were aged below years at the
time of the ISt pregnancy In a similar study of Belagavi more
than of the participants had child marriage and of
their age at first pregnancy was years lll According to the
National Family Health Survey NFHS
of the women population have child marriage and of the
pregnancies are years In this study of the study
participant belonged to the class IV socioeconomic status
followed by class III and only belonged to the
Table Coopland s risk scoring and pregnancy outcome
class I whereas in another study conducted in Kinaye about
belonged to IV socioeconomic class followed by III
and least belonged to class according to modified B G
Prasad s classification ll In the present study around of
the mothers were literate A similar study done in a rural area of
Nagpur showed that were literate
In our study of the women had a normal BMI
were underweight overweight preobese

and sexually transmitted infections STIs are also serious
medical and social issues for women worldwide And because a
woman s reproductive system is complex and delicate which
makes it particularly vulnerable to dysfunction or disease
finding ways to treat conditions that take root in the reproduc
tive tract often prove challenging
However in recent years researchers have been investigat
ing and developing new ways to administer medications for a
range of women s health conditions These new methods aim to

causes a number of side effects but the researchers hoped their
approach would prevent this altogether In tissue culture they
were able to successfully guide the sperm using a magnet toward
the tumor where they then freed the sperm cells to deliver the
drug locally Figure
While these experiments are still being performed in the lab
Medina believes that it would eventually be possible to
deliver these types of engineered therapies to patients She and
her colleagues are still improving how the sperm is guided to
the target tissues In practice a patient s physician or another
medical expert would be responsible for guiding the sperm And
because it s conceivable that the sperm could perform its natu
ral function and fuse with oocytes Medina believes it
would be possible to treat a woman when she s not ovulating
Looking forward she and her colleagues are hoping to use the
same robotic sperm technology to treat ectopic pregnancies and
abnormalities in the epithelium of the uterus
Although it s currently unknown which technologies and
methods of drug delivery will be approved and widely used in the
future researchers are investigating myriad methods Women

not everyone likes to take an oral contraceptive Not everyone
wants a ring I think to be successful in developing new meth
ods for drug delivery we need to have choices for women

Prenatal Care Use Among Selected Asian American Groups
I Stella M Yu ScD MPH Greg R Alexander ScD MPH Renee Schwalberg MPH and Michael D Kogan PhD
Asian Americans are a growing unnugrant
population in the United States Researchers
are only beginning to understand the extent
to which different Asian American groups ex
hlbit unique patterns of maternal health risks
health care use and health outcomes Diver
gent patterns of prenatal care use and low
birthweight and infant mortality risks have
been observed among various Asian Ameri
can subgroups between specific Asian Ameri
can groups and Whites and between native
bom and foreign bom Asian Americans
Early access to and adequate use of pre
natal care have been associated with posi
tive birth outcomes among Asian Ameri
and because it provides the
opportunity for health education and the
early identification and treatment of preg
nancy complications medical conditions
prenatal care has been promoted to reduce
ethnic in adverse pregnancy out
Although the reasons for eth
comes
nic variations in prenatal care use are not
fully understood financial obstacles lan
guage baniers and cultural beliefs are fre
quently cited precursors to inadequate use
along with transportation problems lack of
spousal support the need for child care and
inconvenient office hours
To date no study has examined the use of
prenatal care by Asian Americans at the na
tional level The objective of this study was to
exarnine the sociodemographic predictors of
patterns of prenatal care use no care late

Objectives This study examined the predictors of patterns of prenatal care use no care late ini
tiation of care and inadequate use after early initiation for Asian American ethnic groups in the
United States
Methods Single live births to US resident mothers of Chinese Japanese Korean and Vietnamese
ancestry n were selected from the US natality files Logistic regression was
used to analyze the effects of matemal characteristics on the use measures
Results Korean Americans and Vietnamese Americans had the lowest levels of prenatal care use
Young or single motherhood high parity for age and low educational attainment were the main risk fac
tors for low use
Conclusions Considerable variability exists in prenatal care use amongAsian American ethnic groups

uld father was determined by maternal re

of cultural effects on prenatal care use a vari

Adequacy of prenatal care use was defined
by R GINDEX which incorporates vari

number of visits and the gestational age of
the infant at birth to assess adequacy of
use age in completed weeks
was calculated as the interval between date of
delivery and date of last menshua l period
High attainment was defined
as or more years of education i e beyond
high school Low attainment was
defined as less than years of education
i e less than high school Because adoles
cents have not had the same opportunity to
achieve the level of education as adults ado
lescents or more years above the grade
level for their age were classified as having
high educational attainment whereas those
or more years below their expected grade
Vol No
level for their age were defined as having low
educational attainment This coding scheme
facilitates the exarnination of the impact of
low educational attainment in isolation from
the influence of young matemal age
Parity was determined by the number of
previous live births Having children at home
may represent a potential barrier to care
owing to child care concerns High parity for
age was defined as or more previous births
for adolescents or more previous births for
mothers aged to years or more pre
vious births for mothers aged to years
and or more previous births for mothers
aged years and older
Chi square analyses were used to test for
differences in the proportion of maternal risk
among ethnic goups Owing to
the large number of cases in frie data file
most comparisons would be anticipated to be
statistically significant Logistic regression anal
yses were used to examme the independent
effects of sociodemographic characterisfics on
prenatal care use Three separate models were
run The first model compared the receipt of
no prenatal care wiffl the receipt of any prena
tal care n le second model compared early
first trimester initiation of prenatal care with
later initiation Women with no prenatal care
were excluded from the second model The
third model focused solely on women who
started care in the first trimester comparing
inadequate with adequate or intermediate
