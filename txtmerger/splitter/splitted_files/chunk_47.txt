Abstract
BACKGROUND Almost of all pregnant women can develop potentially life threatening
complications As a result identification of high risk pregnancy at earliest stage will be useful in
directing appropriate intervention Hence the current study was done to determine the prevalence
and outcome of high risk pregnancy among antenatal women in rural Puducherry
MATERIALS AND METHODS A record based longitudinal study was done during March
among antenatal women who have attended rural health center of tertiary care institute High risk
pregnancy was classified based on the guidelines from Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan
and outcome assessment based on the obstetric and neonatal outcomes
RESULTS Among antenatal case record reviewed were in the age group of
years and majority belonged to below poverty line families registered
their current pregnancy within the first trimester The prevalence of high risk pregnancy among study
participants was confidence interval Majority had term delivery
Regarding obstetric and neonatal outcomes majority had spontaneous vaginal delivery
about gave birth to low birth weight baby and only had stillbirth Parity socioeconomic
status and unfavorable outcomes such as low birth weight preterm and postterm delivery were
associated with high risk pregnancy
CONCLUSION The current study found that almost one fifth of the pregnant women in rural area have
high risk pregnancy Unfavorable obstetric and neonatal outcomes were common among high risk
cases Hence early detection of high risk pregnancy needs to be done at primary health care level
to improve the maternal obstetric and neonatal outcomes

Majella et al Outcome of high risk pregnancy in India
as a result of complications during antenatal period
and childbirth There are five main reasons for death of
pregnant women such as severe hemorrhage maternal
infections unsafe abortion hypertension related
disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia and
eclampsia and medical complications such as cardiac
conditions HIV AIDS or diabetes complicating or
complicated by pregnancy Hence all the pregnancies
need to be evaluated for high risk pregnancy through
routine antenatal care provided by the health care
professionals
Identification of high risk pregnancy causes and its
complications through quality antenatal care helps in
achieving favorable maternal obstetric and neonatal
outcome In addition women identified to be at high
risk need to be followed up at regular intervals through
routine care by the health workers at health facility
and home visits to prevent the development of any
maternal or fetal complications Apart from follow up
care appropriate laboratory investigations and referral
services also required to improve the outcome of
pregnancy Prognosis of the outcome also depends on the
type of high risk pregnancy among pregnant mothers
Hence identification of type of high risk pregnancy at
earliest stage will be useful in directing the appropriate
intervention measures for pregnant women
Even though many studies have been done to determine
the prevalence of high risk pregnancy in India
fewer studies were done to determine the outcome
of high risk pregnancy in rural settings especially in
South India Hence the current study was done to
determine the prevalence and outcome of high risk
pregnancy and factors associated with it among antenatal
women attending rural primary health care center in
Puducherry South India
Materials and Methods
This is a record based longitudinal study conducted
by reviewing the maternal and child health MCH
register maintained in the antenatal clinic of JIPMER
Rural Health Centre JIRHC during March
Records were reviewed for the details of pregnant
women available over a period of years from
January to December JIRHC caters to a
population of around spread over four villages
namely Ramanathapuram Thondamanatham
Pillaiyarkuppam and Thuthipet All the four villages
are located within km of the health center which is
located in Ramanathapuram village Health services
are provided by senior resident from the department
of preventive and social medicine who is the medical
officer in charge of the health center undergraduate
intern trainees postgraduates posted from the
Department of Community Medicine JIPMER as well
as by nursing staff and public health nurses
The antenatal clinic of JIRHC is a special clinic established
exclusively for providing comprehensive health checkup
and referral services of pregnant women under the
supervision of the department of community medicine
It is functional once a week at health center which is
located in Ramanathapuram village On an average
pregnant women will be attending every antenatal
clinic and avail health care services The health care
services include essential antenatal care services such as
registration of pregnancy tetanus toxoid immunization
recording of body weight and blood pressure at each
follow up visit basic laboratory investigations such as
hemoglobin blood grouping glucose challenge test
venereal disease research laboratory HIV hepatitis B
surface antigen testing provision of iron and folic acid
tablets counseling for danger signs of pregnancy birth
preparedness nutrition and importance of spacing
contraception immunization and breastfeeding
obstetrician consultation and routine health and
antenatal checkup follow up and referral services
Patients who had missed the scheduled visit are being
followed by the health workers through mobile call or
home visit
All the above mentioned services are provided free of
cost The obstetrician consultation is provided by senior
resident of the department of obstetrics and gynecology
The counseling services are provided by staff nurse
interns posted at JIRHC and medical social worker The
prescription for medication laboratory investigations
to screen for complications and also referral forms for
further follow up in tertiary care center among high risk
cases are given The patient is advised to make regular
follow up visits
Each antenatal woman has a comprehensive case record
which is updated during every visit by the health
workers The case records are issued by medical record
department with a unique identity number This identity
number is entered in the attendees register maintained
at antenatal clinic Confidentiality of information for
all pregnant women was maintained under this unique
identity number The health workers update the blood
pressure during the visit recent blood investigation
reports and also regarding specific advice given to
pregnant women in that case record
Line list of pregnant women who were registered in
antenatal clinic maintained at JIRHC was obtained In
total there were around pregnant women registered
with antenatal clinic Out of which records of
antenatal women were taken for the assessment of
high risk pregnancy and outcome of the pregnancy Rest

Similar findings were found in study done in
Karnataka However we could not assess the other
factors influencing the high risk pregnancy such as
education age at marriage and age at first pregnancy
which were reported by other studies Outcome of the
pregnancy was also found to be unfavorable among the
high risk cases in the current study which is comparable
to the studies done in other parts of India
Limited evidence available on birth outcomes reported
significant association between low birth weight and
high risk pregnancy which is comparable to the current

lower segment cesarean section which is contrast to the
current study However the current study found that
preterm and postterm delivery is more common among
high risk pregnant women
Major strength of the study is the use of standard
guidelines for the diagnosis of high risk pregnancy
which will help to compare the current study findings
across various studies from India All the records were
included in the study which represents the reality of the
status of pregnant women in rural setting The current
study adds to the limited literature available regarding
outcome of high risk pregnancy in a primary care setting
However the study has its own limitations Since the
study is record based and we relied on the data recorded
in the case record there could be errors in entering
the data of the pregnant women by the stakeholders
We could not gather data on various possible factors
Majella et al Outcome of high risk pregnancy in India
influencing high risk pregnancy such as education
employment status spousal support age at marriage
and age at first pregnancy Causal outcome for factors
related to high risk pregnancy and outcomes cannot
be inferred as the data on time of exposure cannot be
retrieved from the case records Further cohort studies
can be done to focus on factors influencing the high risk
pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy
High risk pregnancy can have serious maternal
obstetric and neonatal complications if left undetected
The Government of India has introduced several schemes
for early detection of high risk pregnancy with recent
one being PMSMA which aims to provide quality
antenatal care for pregnant women throughout the
country Even though several measures are taken to
tackle the problems frequent monitoring by the relevant
stakeholders for success and quality of the schemes needs
to be done This can be done by surveying the reduction
in the trend of high risk pregnancy and increase in the
trend of favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes This
can help in improving the quality of service delivery and
strengthen the interventions already in place
Conclusion
The current study found that almost one fifth of the
pregnant women in rural area have high risk pregnancy
with majority of them contributed by maternal age and
PIH Parity and socioeconomic status were independently
associated with high risk pregnancy Even though
most of the study participants had favorable obstetric
and neonatal outcomes unfavorable outcomes such as
low birth weight preterm and postterm delivery were
more common among high risk antenatal women Hence
early detection of high risk pregnancy needs to be done
at primary health care level to improve the maternal
obstetric and neonatal outcome through quality and
accessible antenatal care and appropriate referral services

Analyzing the Effect of Prenatal Care
on Pregnancy Outcome
A Conditional Approach

ABSTRACT
Am Health
InfrMuction
Vital statistics data is a readily avail
able source of information on prenatal
care usage in the United States How to
examine vital statistics and other types of
data for the effect of prenatal care on preg
nan outcome has generated a number of
different methodologies One of the dif
ficulties encountered in using such data
has been the problem of overcoming the
preterm bias effect The preterm bias ef
fect is associated with observing better
outcomes in women who receive prenatal
care than in women who receive no care
This artifact occurs because women re
ceiving no care may deliver prematurely
and may not have an opportunity to enroll
in prenatal care By conditioning the ef
fect of the age of entry into prenatal care
on the gestational age of delivery how
ever the preterm bias effect can be
avoided Nonetheless other problems en
countered in vital statistics data may in
validate the results of the conditional ap
proach
In this study we demonstrate the ef
fect that the possible misclassification of
gestational age in vital statistics data has
on the interpretation of the conditional ap
proach and discuss the problematic nature
of the evaluation of prenatal care
The data for this analysis were ob
tained from linked birth and death certif
icates from Missouri for through
The variables used in the analysis
were the gestational age at which prenatal
care was initiated self report and limited
to the first weeks of pregnancy the
gestational age at delivery based on last
menstrual period the outcome stillbirth

Black or non Black birth number mul
tiple vs single parity maternal age and
maternal education We used only those
records that involved gestational ages of
greater than weeks and less than
weeks Of the records available
were used for the unad
justed analyses and were
used for the adjusted analyses
The association of the gestational age
of entry into prenatal care with pregnancy
outcome was examined relative to the ges
tational age of delivery Outcomes still
births or infant deaths are presented as
death rates percentage dead We calcu
lated odds ratios for stillbirths or infant
deaths by logistic regression models

linear trends were carried out for mortality
rates over the gestational ages of entry
into prenatal care Furthermore we
adjusted our results by declaring new
borns that exceeded the percentile
birth weight standards for gestational age

By conditional analysis the risk per

This higher risk of mortality in early

Discussion
As Tyson et al state the value of
prenatal care has been diffcult to estab
lish When the time of entry into pre
natal care is assessed relative to the time
of delivery several interpretations about
the association of prenatal care with preg
nancy outcome become available For ex
ample it appears that in women who de
livered at less than weeks and who
entered prenatal care in the first trimester
there were more adverse pregnancy out
comes than in those women who delivered
at this ne and were not in prenatal care
We believe this is an artifact Kramer et al
have reported a systematic underestima
tion of gestational age in infants born be
fore weeks when the gestational age is
based solely on the last menstrual period
When infants weighing over the per
centile for their gestational age were elim
inated from the analysis there were no
ignificant trends in mortality rates over
the gestational age of entry into prenatal
care except for those women delivering

between and weeks Whether pre
natal care for these women is responsible
for the better outcome of the early en
trants cannot be determined Early entry
may reflect as much on the healthy behav
ioral characteristics of these women as it
does on any effect of prenatal care
The evaluation of prenatal care is a
complex problem The incorrect assign
ment of gestational age affects signifi
cantly the results of any perinatal analysis
and continues to be a major problem for
which no solution is readily available As
a result there is no ideal model available
to assess the association between prenatal
care and pregnancy outcome Because of
the substantial problems associated with
observational data the use of randomized
trials of different modes of care deserves

The safety of Home Birth The Farm
Study
A Mark Durand MI MPH
Despite a sizable body of literature on
the subject the authors of two recent re
views have concluded that a final judg
ment regarding the relative safety of home
birth still cannot be made
This study compares the outcomes of
a cohort of planned lay midwife
attended home births from the Farm mid
wifery service in rural Tennessee with the
outcomes of a sample of physician at
tended hospital births derived from the
US National Natality Fetal
Mortality Survey NNS NFMS This is
the largest comparative study of a cohort
of home births yet published
Previous studies of home birth safety
underscore the importance of having ex
plicit comparison groups rather than of
being strictly of considering
planned and unplanned home births
separately of tracking intrapartum hos
pital transfers of intended home births
and attributing the outcome to the home
birth group and of controlling for the
effects of birth weight type of delivery
attendant and demogaphic characteris
tics of the mother All these issues have
been addressed in this study
Standards of prenatal care at the
Farm are modeled to the recommenda
tions of the Arnerican College of Obste
tricians and Gynecologists Deliveries are
conducted without analgesia however
and great emphasis is placed on meeting
the emotional needs of the family Several
family members and friends are com
monly in attendance and are encouraged
to take an active role in the birth In
addition the laboring woman is encour
aged to stay off her back and remain phys
ically mobile through labor and delivery
In the absence of signs of fetal distress
women are permitted to labor beyond
hours occasionally for to days They
are also encouraged to eat and drink dur
ing labor in the belief that this allays ma
ternal and the need for opera
tive delivery

Methods
Data
We studied Medicaid recipients in
New York State who delivered live born sin
gleton children between and who
were identified by a tested case finding
screen as HIV infected and who had claims
data linked to vital statistics records of
mothers For mothers with multiple deliver
ies in the study period one delivery was ran
domly selected The study population also
reflects the prior exclusion of mothers
who participated in programs that paid a
global fee for prenatal care since we could
not determine the number or type of their
visits
Birth outcomes served as the criteria for
our analyses Low birthweight was specified
as less than g and preterm birth was
defined as a gestational age of less than
weeks based on the physician s esti
mate or when the physician s estimate was
unavailable of cases the mother s esti
mate of her last menses
The APNCU index was calculated in
ways First we used data on prenatal care
visits from vital statistics records Then we
determined the number and timing of visits
from Medicaid claims for l obstetrics

cology any primary care and HIV related

include infectious disease allergy immunol
ogy hematology and oncology To simplify
the analysis inadequate prenatal care was
compared with all other levels i e ade
quate plus adequate and intermediate
combined
To control for possible confounders we
included several other maternal characteris
tics in our multivariate analyses Lacking
viral load and T lymphocyte data we
evaluated maternal HIV stage from diag
noses previously reported to be predictive of
maternal child HIV transmissio including
history of clinical DS pne monia or
anemia during pregnancy medical
conditions including hypertension asthma
and diabetes were also determined from
diagnoses on claims Illicit drug use was
measured by an approach that in previous
validation studies of claims data identified
of with illicit drug use noted
on charts Other demographic and behav
ioral covariates included age race ethnicity
marital status nativity US including Puerto
Rican vs foreign New York City resi
dence parity year of delivery educational
attainment and smoking and alcohol use
during pregnancy
Analysis
Simple K computed
to assess the chance corrected agreement
among the different measures of adequate
prenatal care These are interpreted in the
same way as intraclass correlation coeffi
cients To evaluate the relative strength of the
association between the variously specified
APNCU indexes and birth outcomes we
compared logistic regression models for
each outcome Each model included the
same covariates with I of the APNCU
indexes there were no significant interaction
terms and the adjusted odds ratio and
confidence interval were contrasted
Results
In of the deliveries the infants
were low birthweight a similar proportion
were preterm The proportion of mothers
with adequate prenatal care utilization var
ied from one half for the APNCU index
derived from vital statistics to two thirds for
the index based on visits to the most com
prehensive set of providers Table As
shown by the K statistic we observed poor
agreement between each of the claims
based APNCU indexes of prenatal care and
the birth certificate based APNCU index
Agreement among the claims based mea
sures was considerably better
The adjusted odds ratios for the types
of data source did not differ dramatically for
either birth outcome Table However the
APNCU measure based on visits to the most
comprehensive set of providers primary
care obstetrics gynecology and HIV special
ists consistently showed the strongest asso
ciation with a to reduction in the
adjusted odds of either birth outcome The
other indexes showed to reduc
tions in the odds of low birthweight How
ever the birth certificate derived measure
showed a reduction in the adjusted odds

Discussion
The assessment of adequacy of prenatal
care utilization based on birth certificate data
showed little agreement with that based on
claims Previous studies of the concordance
of prenatal care information fro
er
tificates and from other dat sources ve
shown simi lar poor agreem nt our
study measures we foun
t the most
comprehensive claims based APNCU index
had the strongest association with both low
birthweight and preterm birth
The APNCU measure developed by
Kotelchuck was not intended to take into
account care by providers other than those
directly involved
ell ering obstetric and
gynecologic ser es n considering visits
to other providers such as internists and HIV
specialists in a measure of adequacy of pre
natal care we may have classified some
women as having adequate prenatal care
when they actually had fewer obstetric visits
than recommended However we hypothe
size that visits to these other providers facili
tated detection and treatment of conditions
that could have had an adverse effect on birth
outcomes e g serious infections hyperten
sion severe anemia asthma or poor nutri
tion We cannot say whether a study of
healthy women or women with diseases other
than HIV infection would show a similar
advantage to considering care during preg
nancy delivered by providers other than
obstetricians
American Journal of Public Health
Our findings should prompt researchers
to consider the value of administrative data
in the examination of prenatal care adequacy
They should also lead researchers to recon
sider the Wpes of visits that should be included
in an evaluation of prenatal care utilization
or more accurately an evaluation of care
during pregnancy For women with chronic
diseases treatment from a broader set of
providers may contribute to improved birth
outcomes Z

ABSTRACT
Objectives This study sought to
identify characteristics of high risk
pregnant women that predicted long
term participation in a home visitation
program
Methods Data regarding sociode
mographic characteristics perceived
needs psychological functioning sub
stance use and informal social support
were collected prospectively from
short term and long term program
participants
Results In comparison with short
term participants long term partici
pants were more likely to have been
African American married nonsmok
ers and enrolled in the program during
their second trimester of pregnancy
and they were more likely to have had
emotional and instrumental support
needs
Conclusions Women with greater
social support needs and healthier behav
iors were more receptive to long term
home visitation than other women Am J
