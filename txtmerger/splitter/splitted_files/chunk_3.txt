About of Afghan women use contraceptives according to
the report of UNFPA Afghanistan In this country women should
ask the permission of their husbands to use contraceptives that
shows the important role of Afghan men in family planning
Studies show that the success of family planning is

dependent to the involvement of men and women Berhane et al
However in less developed countries husband s participa

Factors that encourage or discourage the participation of Afghan men in family planning
Midwifery
The present study indicates that men had interest in participat
ing in family planning programs in Afghanistan as more than
of women declared it Considering the low level of contraceptive
use in this country the findings of the study show the importance
and success of family planning centers in promoting sexual and
reproductive health and family planning A study in Jordan
showed that although more than of studied men knew about
family planning reported that they used contraceptives More
over believed that both husband and wife should decide about
family planning Mansour et al In Kenya of men in
Nigeria and in Senegal reported to be using modern con
traceptives Okigbo et al Study by Nurfaizah et al demon
strated that male participation in family planning was low in In
donesia Moreover men s knowledge of family planning and repro
ductive health social values culture and attitudes affected their
participation in family planning For the implementation of FP pro
grams they suggested that communication education and cooper
ation of religious leaders and stakeholders and public and private
sector authorities were essential Nurfaizah et al
In our study that focuses on the couples referring to special
health facilities designated for providing family planning services
a large number of men supported their wives to use family plan
ning however not all of them were willing to buy contraceptives
This might be related to the cultural factors e g men are dissuad
ing to seek information on family planning and reproductive and
sexual health UNFPA In Iran men usually make decisions
on using family planning and type of contraception for the couple
Nabavi et al Their participation in family planning pro
grams differs across the country In a study in Iran men reported
the fear of side effects of contraceptives and one third of them
showed the sense of male domination and behavior based on tra
ditional stereotypes of gender roles Ghiasi and Karimi
In a study in Malawi socio economic factors were recognized as
influential in men s involvement in FP Accessibility of the methods
and affordability of contraceptives were influenced by those fac
tors
Dral et al These findings are in line with the present
study that showed people having higher income and education in

My husband and I are not sure about the future I

insecurity and conflict in the country
In current economic situation large families have
difficulties to meet their children needs They
cannot afford sending their children particularly the
girls to school they choose to marry off them in a
young age
I want to continue my education and my husband
agrees with me to postpone pregnancy
Family planning services are mostly provided in
women s section in hospitals that men are not
allowed to enter Moreover midwives and female
doctors are not allowed to provide family planning
counselling to men They give information to
women and they share it with their husbands
Contraceptives are harmful for our health
My husband likes to have boys and girls
My husband agreed birth spacing but we think
permanent sterilization is a sin
They think Allah is the determinant of child bearing
and people should not interfere in his decision
People think it is a shame not to have children
particularly boys
H Shabanikiya A Darman V Ghavami et al
volved more in FP Oyediran et al found that the age and edu
cation of the husbands number of living children and receiving
information from family planning providers were the principal de
terminants of men s involvement Oyediran et al All these
factors had statistically significant relationships with male partici
pation in our study too Kamal et al studied the factors influencing
men involvement in FP in Bangladesh and found that male involve
ment was percent in the studied area and women s level of
education had a direct effect on FP use that supports the finding
of our study Kamal et al In Kamal et al study as couple
aged the use of contraceptives increased but the present study re
vealed an opposite situation since younger couples intended to use
contraceptives and involved in FP more
The support of married Afghan men to use FP methods in this
study was more than a study in Ethiopia Kassa et al The
study by Dewi illustrated that men can keep important roles by
giving support in using family planning and also during the preg
nancy period of their wives These findings are consistent with
the findings of the present study Dewi Less than
of studied men did not participate in family planning program
at all Supporting and reminding were the most frequent types
of participation and preparing the contraception the least fre
quent one Moreover women whose spouses participated in family
planning program were significantly p more satisfied than
those whose spouses did not participate Women receiving support
are more probable to continue using family planning In this study
the number of children in families that husbands did not partici
pate in family planning was significantly p higher than the
other group that is similar to what Overdiran found in his study
Oyediran et al
According to this study the factors that encouraged men to
participate in family planning were the concerns about the fu
ture of children and the health and welfare of the mothers How
ever cultural norms supporting larger families the desire for hav
ing boy children the fear of contraception s side effects and reli
gious prohibitions discouraged them in using FP These results are
in line with the exploratory qualitative study conducted by USAID
to identify factors that influence use of family planning methods
at the individual couple family service accessibility socio cultural
and policy environment for improvement of contraceptive use in
Afghanistan USAID Shafiqollah et al also pointed out some
factors such as religious prohibitions and cultural norms as incen
tives for Afghans not to sought FP Shafiqullah et al
Conclusion
The aim of this study was to determine men s participa
tion in family planning from the perspectives of their wives in
Afghanistan The results indicate that men have interest in fam
ily planning in this country Several factors affect the participation
of men in such programs Younger couples the ones with higher
income and education reported higher degree of male participa
tion in family planning They supported their wives in the use of
contraceptives more than other groups Recognition of these fac
tors can help policy makers in designing behavioral interventions
A couple oriented approach to family planning would be helpful
The factors that discourage men to participate family planning
need to be addressed About religious prohibitions talking with
clergies might help By prioritizing children s education and the
welfare of wives by new generation the cultural norms about
larger families will change in future By providing information
about family planning particularly to young people the use of con
traceptives will increase in this country However the aim of such
activities should not necessarily be decreasing the size of popula
tion but the fulfilment of people sexual and reproductive rights
Midwifery
Limitations of the study
In this study women were asked about the participation of
their husbands that might be different with the opinion of their
husbands So our findings should be interpreted with caution The
other limitation was that the study population was women refer
ring to family planning centers So the results cannot be general
ized to all Afghan women Still with these limitations this study
provides useful insights for policy makers in Afghanistan to better
implement family planning programs

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Child and maternal health a key marker of overall health system performance is a policy priority
area by the World Health Organization and the United Nations including the Sustainable Development Goals
Previous realist work has linked child and maternal health outcomes to globalization political tradition and the
welfare state It is important to explore the role of other key policy related factors This paper presents a realist
synthesis categorising policy instruments according to the established NATO model to develop an explanatory
model of how policy instruments impact child and maternal health outcomes
Methods A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies assessing the relationships between
policy instruments and child and maternal health outcomes Data were analysed using a realist framework The
first stage of the realist analysis process was to generate micro theoretical initial programme theories for use in
the theory adjudication process Proposed theories were then adjudicated iteratively to produce a set of final
programme theories
Findings From a total of unique records records proceeded to full text screening and papers were
included in the review Evidence from studies was available to address this research question Studies were
published from to assessed a single country and analysed data at the ecological level
Eighty eight initial candidate programme theories were generated Following theory adjudication five final
programme theories were supported According to the NATO model these were related to treasure organisation
authority treasure and treasure organisation instrument types
Conclusions This paper presents a realist synthesis to develop an explanatory model of how policy instruments
impact child and maternal health outcomes from a large systematically identified international body of evi
dence Five final programme theories were supported showing how policy instruments play an important yet
context dependent role in influencing child and maternal health outcomes
Linking political factors to child and maternal health
Politics has been defined as the practice of the art and science of
administering states
Longstanding

conceptual and theoretical links between politics and population health
exists The notion that medicine is a social science and politics nothing
but medicine at a larger scale Virchow cited by Mackenbach
has been described as public health s biggest idea Mackenbach
Despite the emergence in recent decades of formal evidence based
pathways for policymaking in the context of pharmaceuticals and
other health technologies Banta Sorenson and Chalkidou

influence on many aspects of broader health related policymaking

acting as an effective marker of the health of a country s health system
Pinzon Florez et al Moreover reducing maternal mortality by
and achieving universal access to reproductive health were key
elements of Millennium Development Goal which were not met in
despite considerable progress World Bank This relates to the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goal Good health and
well being in particular Target which aims to reduce the global
maternal mortality ratio to less than per live births and
Target which aims to end all preventable deaths under five years of
age and keep neonatal mortality in all countries to below per
live births and under mortality to below per live births
intended to be achieved by United Nations General Assembly
Meanwhile the American Public Health Association has identi
fied the importance of sociological factors in determining child health
outcomes and addressing this as important to achieve health equity
American Public Health Association
A previous realist review Barnish et al considered four po
litical exposures democracy welfare state provision political tradition
and globalisation in relation to child and maternal health outcomes
Especially in more developed countries left of centre political tradition
generated a greater focus on welfare state measures contributing to
reduced child mortality and low birth weight while a more generous
welfare state improved social conditions contributing to reductions in
infant and maternal mortality In lower and middle income countries
LMICs increased globalisation led to increased international trade
dependency and increased influence of multinational corporations and
international trade organisations contributing to increased child and
infant mortality and youth smoking rates This provided greater insight
into understanding the extent to which different political exposures
could affect child and maternal health outcomes In this paper we
address a gap identified in this work to examine the roles and in
teractions of policy instruments on child and maternal health This ad
vances the understanding of how a broader range of policy level
exposures relate to these outcomes and what mechanisms may operate
Relevant theoretical perspectives
Realist synthesis Pawson et al is an approach to evidence
synthesis that facilitates moving beyond descriptive analysis to offer a
theoretically informed explanatory insight into how the effects identi
fied in a body of evidence may operate The theoretical insights garnered
through realist synthesis are conceptualised in terms of programme
theories which are composed of context mechanism outcome configu
rations CMOs The theoretical lens of realist synthesis is based on the
epistemological foundations of critical realism
A realist
Bhaskar
synthesis culminates in a context specific and temporally sensitive
middle range theory enabling the understanding of a wide range of
intermingling relations between contexts and mechanisms that lead to
favourable or unfavourable population health outcomes
A number of macro theoretical perspectives may inform consider
ations around the relationship between politics and population health
Key relevant political theories include neoliberalism
Mirowski and
dependency theory
and socialist and
Piehwe
James
social democratic theories Bailey Lamb and Docherty In
the context of democracy political tradition welfare state provision and
globalisation in relation to child and maternal health it was found that
the realist programme theories supported by the evidence base aligned
most closely with macro theoretical perspectives within the broadly
socialist sphere Barnish et al
In addition to the above political exposures there are further theo
retical perspectives relevant to population health which are specifically
appertaining to policy instruments

Hood s terminology that can be used by governments to address policy
problems see also the table below In this study the NATO model is
used to analyse the targets of interventional tools and the relation be

networks authority refers to the legal power of the government to
command regulate or delegate to achieve goals treasure refers to a
wide variety of financial incentives and mechanisms such as the ability
to demand taxes or fund initiatives and organizational instruments
involve the deployment of resources to form organisations and markets
and provide goods and services such as through the deployment of
personnel to improve operational performance or structure see

offers the advantages of being a widely used
long established approach using four broad analytical categories
Aims of the current work
Much about what has been written on the programmatic innovation
and health system strengthening efforts to improve maternal and child
health outcomes understand these efforts as either top down reform or
bottom up strategy involving a limited number of actors and in
stitutions These innovations and efforts often comprise a spectrum of
strategies that involve the deployment of a single instrument or multiple
instruments packaged together in a single reform initiative In addition
the implementation mechanisms of these initiatives can be far more
intricate involving multiple actors and institutions working either
uniformly synergistically or antagonistically The understanding of
tools and implementation mechanisms in these reform initiatives that
strengthen child and maternal health has not been studied extensively
to the best of our knowledge Moreover existing policy evaluations in
this area have tended to be successionist and descriptive while the field
would benefit from a shift to a generative realist approach that provides
an explanatory account Thus the current work synthesises evidence
linking policy instruments analysed using the NATO model Hood
to child and maternal health outcomes

The following bibliographic databases were searched in March
to identify studies
MEDLINE ALL Ovid
APA Psyclnfo Ovid
Health Management Information Consortium Ovid
Global Health Ovid
Social Policy and Practice Ovid
Web of Science Clarivate Analytics
International Bibliography of the Social Sciences ProQuest
The search strategies were developed by an information specialist
following a discussion with the project lead The information specialist
conducted all searches starting with database searches followed by
supplementary searches and citation chasing
Database searches comprised terms for women and children terms
for different policy political exposures both general terms and terms
related to policy instruments to ensure coverage and terms for health
services and disparities No study type filters or date limits were used
but results were limited to the English language To increase specificity
a search for expected outcomes was also added using likely outcomes as
identified in a prior realist review on political factors in relation to child
and maternal health Barnish et al The full search strategy can
be found in Appendix A
The search process was iterative Relevant references from the initial
realist review were used as a test set to ensure they were captured in the
final search results Different subject headings and keywords were tested
systematically to identify which of these captured the full test set and
which excluded some papers to achieve an optimum balance of sensi
tivity and specificity
The search results were exported to Endnote Thomson Reuters
NY USA and de duplicated using automatic checking Items included
after full text screening were forward and backward citation chased
using Scopus Elsevier and Web of Science Clarivate to identify
additional relevant studies
First and last author searches were conducted on a pilot selection of
key papers in Scopus Since in all cases the corresponding author was
either the first or last author separate corresponding author searches
were not required Searches of included studies and key identified re
views were also conducted
Title and abstract screening were initially conducted by one
reviewer and a independent screening check was performed by a
second reviewer Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion be
tween the initial two reviewers involving two further senior team
members as required Potentially relevant records proceeded to full text
review which was initially conducted by one reviewer with a
Social Science Medicine
independent screening check by a second reviewer Any discrepancies
were resolved by discussion involving two further senior team members
as required
Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer and a inde
pendent check was conducted by a second reviewer Any disagreements
were resolved by discussion involving two further senior team members
as appropriate Data were extracted onto a standardised form designed
to capture the following information Bibliographic details country
countries of study methodology Ssmple size sampling frame years of
study exposure measure outcome measure results information to help
develop programme theories When deciding which results to extract all
key study findings relevant to the review question were extracted with a
focus on narrative results that could enrich theory development and
adjudication rather than quantitative effect sizes and p values as used to
inform meta analyses
Level of development was categorised into a binary classification of
developed countries vs LMICs whereby countries on the World Bank
high income list World Bank undated a were classified as developed
and countries on the World Bank low income World Bank undated b
and middle income World Bank
undated c lists were classified as
LMICs Since this study used realist methods no formal assessment of
the risk of bias was undertaken
Realist analysis
The first stage of the realist analysis process was to generate micro
theoretical initial programme theories for use in the theory adjudica
tion process Realist initial programme theory development is typically
an iterative process informed by a defined set of sources of knowledge
which can include textual sources discussions broader epistemological
and theoretical perspectives applicable to the broad field of study and
the authors subject knowledge To ensure a broad range of perspectives
were taken into account included studies were each randomly assigned
to one of four reviewers with different disciplinary backgrounds
Through engagement with the assigned study as well as broader in
formation from the body of studies as a whole and relevant theoretical
perspectives the four reviewers formed initial programme theories via a
process of open coding
These initial programme theories were first dimensionalised i e
related to each other across studies to understand similarities and dif
ferences by two reviewers in the context of policy instruments applying
the NATO model
They were then iteratively discussed and
Hood
adjudicated in a series of team meetings
Theory adjudication i e which theories around the intervention
seem to fit best Rycroft Malone et al was performed separately
for each programme theory Coding was conducted manually For this
process studies were divided in a ratio between two reviewers and
the results of this adjudication were verified and refined through itera
tive rounds of discussion at meetings attended by all four reviewers The
process involved an overall assessment of the consistency of findings i
e assessment of demi regularities in outcome patterns by
context mechanism combinations in the direction that would support
the programme theory Consistency and strength of evidence were
assessed by discussion among the team taking into account how many
studies were available how many of the studies had broadly comparable
findings and the geographical profile of the findings Then a more
detailed assessment of studies for which the findings were in the di
rection that would support the programme theory was conducted This
enabled the precise context mechanism and outcome configuration to be
tested and refined The concept of mechanism was defined as per
Falleti
portable concepts that explain how and why a hy
and Lynch
pothesized cause in a given context contributes to a particular
outcome Since many studies incorporated countries at different levels
of development it was not feasible to stratify the analysis by level of
development

Results
Identification of evidence
Database searches yielded a total of records see Appendix A
for breakdown by each database of which remained following
de duplication This was supplemented by additional unique re
cords from citation chasing and from author searches for an
overall total of unique records Following title and abstract
screening records proceeded to full text screening A total of
publications proceeded to inclusion representing a total of unique
studies Concordance between the two reviewers was at title and
abstract screening and at full text screening which the review team
considered to be appropriately high A list of articles screened at the full
text stage indicating which were included and which were excluded

Initial programme theories
Separate lists of initial programme theories were generated by each
of the four reviewers based on their respective allocated studies
Following de duplication and initial dimensionalisation candidate
programme theories were produced and analysed according to the
NATO model Hood
This list is provided in Appendix E
Theory adjudication
After further iteration and integration of candidate programme
theories as part of the theory adjudication process four candidate CMO
domains were considered to be well supported by the evidence base
Two of these were single instrument candidate CMOs domains treasure
and organisation while two were multi instrument configurations
authority treasure and treasure organisation Treasure appeared overall
to be the most frequently supported domain at this stage in the analysis
Within the single instrument treasure domain support was greatest with
regard to expenditure on health and or social services both improve
ments in outcomes associated with increased investment and deterio
ration in outcomes associated with austerity measures and cash transfer
programmes Within the single instrument organisation domain sup
port was greatest for overall health system improvements integration
and strengthening and focused health interventions for child and
maternal health including in the community Nodality based ap
proaches were not among the best supported
After the best supported candidate CMO domains were identified
within the evidence base
further iterative team discussion

Ashiabi et al Bishai et al and Langnel and Buracom
found that in an LMIC context increased public expenditure on
health led to lower child mortality rates through an improvement in
health service provision and access but this effect depended on coun
tries having sufficient governance to facilitate administrative capacity
On a related theme
Behera and Dash
found that in Southeast
Asian countries increased public health expenditure showed positive
effects on the reduction of infant mortality achieved through the
mechanism of improved government effectiveness to expand healthcare
facilities Furthermore

Factor and Kang did not find a direct rela
tionship between health expenditure and health outcomes once other
factors such as level of economic development regime autocracy and
corruption had been considered suggesting these may be important
determinants of child and maternal health outcomes

LMICs Considering countries from to
Kim and Lane
found further evidence supporting the beneficial impact of
increased health expenditures on infant mortality and life expectancy at
birth While many studies focused on health expenditures Bradley et al
found that in OECD countries an increased ratio of social relative
to health expenditures was predictive of better outcomes in infant
mortality life expectancy and increased potential life years lost after
adjusting for the level of health expenditures and GDP Goldstein et al
found that increased spending on environmental educational
and infant mortality all reduced infant mortality the impact being
greatest with lower maternal age

Hall et al
especially in lower income contexts increased financial investment is
linked with rapid impacts on under five and maternal mortality through
improvements in government spending on health and infrastructure and
improved household spending while conversely government debt
refinancing or tax incentives may lead to short term worsening in health
due to a reduced ability to spend at both household and government
levels Focusing on more specific types of increased investment

evidence for the influence of a fee subsidy policy for deliveries and
emergency obstetric and neonatal care on neonatal mortality rates

expanding public insurance led to better health outcomes for women
through improved access to maternal care services while a maternal and
child health services block grant facilitated reduced infant mortality

Considering the authority treasure domain further certain studies
offered insight into favourable treasury policies that lack enforcement

improve maternal survival or influence the causes of maternal mortality
Also in a Kenyan context

increased the number of facility based deliveries but this did not
convert into a significant reduction in maternal or neonatal mortality

Taylor et al
in a
Medicaid non expansion state in the US did not find an association be
tween Medicaid status at delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes
Urquieta Salomon et al identified increased utilisation of health
services and increase in health equity as potential mechanisms for the
beneficial impact of universal health insurance legislation on maternal
and child health
Furthermore certain studies showed how authority mechanisms
bolstered the deployment of treasury tools
Irish et al
found that
changes to the treasure related instrument of parental leave imple
mented based on authority mechanisms in a high income context are
associated with diffuse maternal and child health outcomes Improve
