Discussion
In this multicenter cohort study we found some adverse associa
tions between placental metal concentrations and birth size
Specifically Cd level was associated with reduced birth weight and
length in a linear manner and with increasing odds of LBW in the
global sample placental Hg level was related to reduced head cir
cumference in female newborns and Cr level was associated with
reduced birth length in the global sample These associations were in
dependent of gestational age or preterm birth suggesting that exposure
to these metals influences fetal growth Interestingly Cd levels were
associated with a slight increase in gestational age and lower odds of
preterm delivery There was also evidence of positive associations of
Mn with gestational age in males and with head circumference in fe
males and of Cr with gestational age in the global sample
The placental metal levels found in the INMA cohorts fall within the
low intermediate range of previous reports as already described
Amaya et al Freire et al Studies on placental bio
markers of exposure to toxic metals in relation to birth outcomes have
published conflicting results
Saleh et al Esteban
Vasallo et al et al Gundacker et al Guo
et al Kippler et al Llanos and Ronco Ronco et al
Stasenko et al Zhang et al
Thus a large study

gatively associated with head circumference but not with birth weight
or length and that placental Cd or Pb was not related to birth an

Saleh et al

Guo et al
and in a small

and ng g respectively vs ng g In the Austrian study how
ever placental Pb content which was higher than in our study
vs ng g was inversely related to birth weight and length but not

while other studies indicated a relationship between placental Cd and
reduced birth weight Kippler et al Ronco et al Stasenko

Kippler et al In contrast two small studies in China Zhang

found no association of

placental Cd and Pb levels which were much higher than in the current
study with birth weight length or head or abdominal circumference
Other studies found no association between placental levels of Hg Pb
or Cd and birth outcomes Esteban Vasallo et al
Cadmium
Because Cd accumulates in the placenta higher Cd levels would be
expected in placentas from longer pregnancies This may explain the
observed positive association with gestational age however this is not
supported by previous findings of no or inverse associations between
placental Cd and gestational age Esteban Vasallo et al
et al Kippler et al Yang et al and the possibility
of residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out Despite its partial
retention in the placenta Cd appeared to exert the most negative effect
on birth size in our study population and placental Cd levels may be an
indicator of maternal smoking during pregnancy
Ronco et al
Accordingly placental Cd content was significantly higher in the pre
sent mothers who smoked during pregnancy than in those who did not

However in contrast to our finding a recent

Jacobo Estrada et al Stasenko et al Cd has also
been identified as an endocrine disruptor interfering with the estrogen
receptor Kortenkamp In vitro studies have shown that Cd re
duces the expression of the placental enzyme hydroxysteroid de

This enzyme protects the fetus
Yang et al
from high maternal glucocorticoid levels which may lead to fetal
growth restriction and female fetuses have been shown to be more
sensitive than male fetuses to increased glucocorticoid levels Murphy
In this line
Kippier et al
reported that
et al
prenatal Cd exposure in Bangladesh was negatively related to birth
weight and head circumference in females alone and that the asso
ciation with fetal size was stronger for the females Our results do not
support previously published findings of sex specific effects of Cd on
birth size and this issue requires further research
Arsenic
Exposure to high naturally occurring levels of As in drinking water
has been associated with adverse birth outcomes especially a sig
nificant reduction in birth weight Laine et al Milton et al
Quansah et al Rahman et al Several recent studies
in the US have corroborated the association of prenatal As exposure as
measured by drinking water concentration inorganic As and maternal
levels total As with reduced birth weight at lower levels of exposure
Almberg et al Claus Henn et al Gilbert Diamond et al
while some evidence although still inconsistent has suggested
that relatively lower levels of maternal total As are also related to re
duced head circumference Claus Henn et al Gilbert Diamond
et al
In the present study placental total As level was not re
lated to birth size or gestational age probably due to low levels of
exposure especially in the Granada cohort and the fact that As ex
posure in our population was mostly from fish in which As is largely
found in its less toxic organic form
Fort et al
Mercury
Conflicting results have been published on the relationship between
birth outcomes and total Hg levels measured in cord blood or in ma
ternal hair or blood Some authors have reported a relationship with
reduced birth size Saleh et al Gundacker et al Murcia
et al Vigeh et al wells et al
and premature
delivery
Xue et al
whereas others found no association with
birth anthropometry Bashore et al Guo et al Drouillet
Pinard et al Karagas et al or gestation length
Bashore
et al Drouillet Pinard et al Murcia et al Wells
et al
Studies of placental Hg levels have also yielded contra
dictory results Saleh et al Esteban Vasallo et al
The present study provides evidence of a negative effect of
placental Hg on head circumference in females and suggests that the
apparent negative effect on birth length is confounded by maternal fish
intake as previously observed in relation to cord blood Hg in the INMA
study
Murcia et al Some previous studies have reported a
negative association of prenatal Hg exposure with head circumference
Saleh et al Murcia et al Cord blood total Hg levels in
four of the present INMA cohorts were also associated with reduced
head circumference independently of maternal fish intake but no
difference was observed between the sexes Murcia et al It is
noteworthy that a high proportion of the INMA cord blood samples had
elevated levels of total Hg which were influenced by maternal intake of
large oily fish
and were positively correlated with
Llop et al
placental Hg levels data not shown Discrepancies between findings
from INMA and other studies may be attributable to differences in
sample sizes exposure biomarkers degree of Hg exposure or to the
lack of adjustments for maternal fish intake and other relevant con
founders among other factors
The negative association observed between Hg and head cir
cumference in females is consistent with the finding by our previous
investigation of a negative relationship between cord blood Hg and
psychomotor development at year of age in females alone Llop et al
given that birth head circumference may be linked to subsequent
cognitive development Methyl Hg has been found to induce oxidative

tribute to the effects of Hg on impaired fetal growth However further
research is required to elucidate the biological mechanism underlying
the sex specific association observed between Hg exposure and birth
size
Lead
Prenatal Pb exposure is known to affect embryonic development
and is associated with several adverse outcomes from infancy through
adolescence It has been postulated that even low level Pb exposure
may impair infant growth and development Bellinger
How
ever a review in described the epidemiological evidence for an
C Freire et al
association of in utero Pb exposure with fetal growth and preterm birth
as limited
Wigle et al
Since then several studies in populations
with different levels of exposure mostly measured in maternal blood
have reported adverse associations of Pb levels with birth weight
length and head circumference gestational age LBW SGA and pre
term delivery
Gundacker et al Lamichhane et al
Rodosthenous et al Taylor et al Vigeh et al Wang
et al zhu et al
Placental Pb content was low in the
present population especially in younger cohorts confirming previous
INMA findings of cord blood levels several times lower than the
threshold established by the World Health Organization Llop et al
In fact among women with data available on placental and cord
blood Pb N of those with placental Pb levels below the LD
had undetected cord blood Pb As in the case of As the low placental Pb
levels in our study population may explain the apparent lack of an
adverse association between Pb and birth outcomes
Manganese and chromium
Studies addressing prenatal exposure to Mn have shown varied re
sults in relation to fetal growth and gestation length
et al
Tsai et al Vigeh et al Zota et al
with some ex
perimental studies finding reduced fetal weight in pregnant mice ex
posed to Mn Colomina et al Sanchez et al In the present
study there was a positive effect of Mn on gestational age and an ap
parent sex specific effect on increased head circumference which re
mains unclear and warrants further investigation Mn is involved in the
functioning of numerous organ systems and is needed for immune
function digestion and bone growth but excessive Mn exposure is
considered harmful to the fetus Aschner and Aschner However
present results do not appear to support the hypothesis that fetal
growth is favored by lower Mn levels but impaired by elevated levels in
disagreement with the finding by
of an inverse U
Zota et al
shaped relationship between maternal blood Mn and birth weight
Higher urinary Cr levels in Chinese pregnant women from the
general population were associated with an increased risk of LBW in a
case control study
Xia et al
and with shorter gestation length
and greater risk of preterm delivery in a large N cohort study
Pan et al
and these associations seemed to be modified by the
sex of the newborn Pan et al Xia et al In contrast cord
blood Cr levels were not associated with newborns birth size in a recent
study conducted in a non industrialized island in the Canary archipe
Iago Spain Cabrera Rodriguez et al Although the toxicity of Cr
is mainly attributable to the hexavalent form Cr excessive triva
lent Cr Cr which is the biologically active form of Cr may also be
hazardous for health As in the Chinese studies
Pan et al Xia
et al
total Cr levels were recorded in the present investigation
but our results do not support their conclusions because we found that
elevated Cr levels were associated with reduced birth length but longer
gestation The lack of adverse association found in our study between
Cr and other anthropometrical parameters or gestational age may
possibly be due to the low levels of exposure to Cr Cr and Cr in
our study population as also observed in the Canary islands Cabrera
Rodriguez et al
Strengths and limitations
Major strengths of the present study include the relatively large
number of participants in comparison to previous studies on placental
metal levels the adjustment for several confounders the performance
of sensitivity analysis sex stratified analysis adjustment for fish intake
and exclusion of preterm births and the use of the placenta as ex
posure matrix In addition this is one of the few studies to examine Mn
and Cr in relation to birth outcomes Given the accumulation of metals
such as Cd in the placenta during pregnancy it offers a singular op
portunity to assess chronic maternal exposure to toxic chemicals
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health
avoiding the need for repeated maternal blood or urinary sampling
Esteban and Castafio Nonetheless the relationship between
this measurement and exposure at critical times during pregnancy re
mains unknown Our study is also limited by the fact that genders were
not equally distributed the Granada cohort recruited only boys
therefore sex specific associations should be interpreted with caution
It should also be taken into account that some significant associations
observed could result from chance because multiple analyses were
performed However some of the statistically significant associations
found were in line with the literature and seem unlikely to be the result
of chance or residual confounding particularly the dose response re
lationships observed for Cd and Mn in relation to birth size Further
more the low numbers of LBW premature and SGA newborns with
available data on placental metal levels likely reduced the precision of
our estimates Finally the measures of birth outcomes were recorded
according to each hospital protocol and our findings may have been
subject to non differential measurement error
Conclusions
This study of Spanish mother child pairs from the general popula
tion found that in utero exposure to Cd and Cr as measured by placental
levels was associated with reduced birth size with no apparent sex
specific effects and that placental Hg was associated with reduced head
circumference in females Although the magnitude of the estimated
effects is not necessarily clinically relevant for newborns the ubiquity
of exposure to these metals especially to Hg through fish intake re
presents an important public health issue Furthermore results ob
tained suggest that Mn exposure may have a beneficial effect on ge
station length and female head circumference and that Cr may also
have a positive impact on gestational length but further investigation is
required to verify this possible effect Larger prospective studies are
also needed to confirm the adverse associations observed and to iden
tify developmental windows of particular susceptibility to potentially
toxic metals

Abstract In Maternal Mortality Rate MMR was still
high especially in Indonesian It had strong a correlation in
Millenium Development Goals to achieve the better quality of
human life Surprisingly most of maternal mortality case is
usually preventable with good quality of knowledge In this day
the use of social media has been increasing In social media
has been using by billion people worldwide and the sixth
highest number of internet user comes from Indonesia Besides
that pregnant women have a tendency to use social media for
seeking out about health information during pregnancy in
prenatal perinatal and postnatal also reproductive health topics
We created Jakpros application a smart mobile application who
designed for women The purpose of it is for serving better health
service and reliable information Our aim in this study is to
analyze how the educational page in Jakpros application can
increase pregnant women knowledge We recruited pregnant
women participant from several sub district hospitals in
Jakarta We detected their knowledge of reproductive health in
pre test questionnaire about basic pregnancy After that we
guided them to download Jakpros application on their mobile
phone We asked them to use it in weeks and we were seeing
their knowledge in post test The observational analytics study was
using cross sectional and analyzed by SPSS to see the
differences in knowledge Their knowledge has been increasing
after they used the educational page feature in weeks Along with
this era Jakpros application is an effective platform for making
pregnant women is more educable

I INTRODUCTION
Maternal mortality rate MMR in Indonesia was still high
In we found out mortality cases of live births
As we knew MMR is one of Millenium Goals Development
important indicator to achieve the better quality human life and
health in the world In the global target has a goal to
decrease MMR until less than cases To achieve the goals we
have to know the main factor who plays an important role The
past study showed that the pregnant women educational level is
correlated with their mortality and health status during
USAID SHERA SMART CITY
pregnancy Meanwhile many of the mortality cases are actually
can be detected and prevented in the earlier stage at least one
quarter until one half cases Indirectly knowledgeable people is
more awareness and have a tendency for getting better health
than people who do not
Social media has been using by billion worldwide users
in The number is predicted to increase in In this
era people have frequently used the internet for seeking out
information especially in young women Related to it pregnancy
is stressful moment and pregnant women had a tendency to use
the internet to get another experience and opinion We could
see that social media as an effective tool for giving knowledge
and as a platform for health promotion for preventing
Pregnant women often to use it of convenience and the low cost
effectiveness access Furthermore it makes many new invention
in making mobile health application who especially designed for
women
In We created the Jakpros application Jakarta
Reproduksi Sehat Jakpros is a smart mobile health application
who designed for women For making Jakpros application it
needed framework who connect to build up a mobile hybrid
applications with CSS and AngularJS Furthermore
Web Browser was using for development and Google Chrome
to debug it Currently Jakpros application is only available in
Android We can simply get it by download from Google play
store and the cost is free The purpose of the Jakpros application
is for giving our patient convenience in communicate and access
information We would like to explain the feature in it First the
educational page is a feature to get reproductive health
information such as prenatal care cervical cancer prevention
high risk pregnancy and contraception knowledge The
educational page display was a pictorial article and easy to read
with language that is understood by the patient In this
application we served information from the reliable obstetrician
and gynecologist doctor and the patient does not have to worried
about credibility The second feature is the question and answers
forum by directly connecting the doctor and their patient In the
past study we found out that patient would like to ask about their
symptoms quickly and did not have to go to the doctor because
of they lazy or shy to do it They would be happy to get

III RESULTS
One hundred and sixty six pregnant women from several
Sub District Public Hospital in Jakarta assessed to this study
For the beginning participants who did not require the
criteria were exclusion We conducted participants who
assessed to this study After that they signed in the informed
consent and answered a pre test questionnaire In the next days
after weeks they used this application we collected them to fill
out the post test questionnaire and participants were drop out
of in this study Our total sampling was participants There
were no specific follow up in this study In table I we could see
the study was dominated by women in years old
Most of the participant educational level was college and above
had islam religion housewife and married
women We conducted questions in multiple choice
answer consisted of anemia nutrition and high pregnancy In
this paper we showed you the right answer and their answered
Table II In the first question we asked What is anemia
means this purpose of this question was to detect their basic
knowledge in it Most of the participants did not know the
definition of anemia In the the pre test around of them
answered anemia as decreased of red blood cells and
participants answered anemia as decreased of hemoglobin In
the post test there was an increase in the hemoglobin answer
Second question was about How much calcium needs
during pregnancy most of them answered that need mg
per day calcium each day The right question was answered by
in pre test and in post test We asked the benefit
of amino acid for the third question We knew the answer was
for fetal brain development and most of them answer it correctly
in to Fourth participant answered that
pregnant women need mg day calories in weeks of
pregnancy the pre test was just answered for the right
Even though they did not know in anemia definition they
understood hemoglobin as an important role for hemoglobin
formation Pre test was and post test was After the
antenatal care question then we asked high risk pregnancy
question Most of them answer right answer since the pre test
and has been increasing in the post test We found out increased
rate was from to in the post test for high risk
pregnancy early sign Furthermore in the pre test
participant answered seizure as the sign of eclampsia and it was
significantly changed in post test around Then they
could recognize that weight gain during pregnancy more than I
kg in one week was abnormal We have seen an increased rate
from to Dyspnea was a sign in heart disease
answered by in the pre test and in post test For
the last question there were increased in answer for the
placenta previa sign
In Table III we used Wilcoxon test and see the overall
difference of the pre and post test P was statistically
significant We focused to analyze the correlation between their
score in educational level and job Figure III I V with Kruskal

more aware if they understand in it They could detect early sign
ofdisease and will lead them to right decision Furthermore they
would do antenatal care regularly and keep their lifestyle to
prevent unwanted things
We found out people with a higher education background
and had other jobs e g entrepreneur and freelancer were
having a better in basic reproductive knowledge In the past
study was shown that people with higher education have a
tendency to get better knowledge due to experience and ease of
access Therefore there was still an increase in other
educational background and other jobs after using it in daily
In our study we could not judge yet that knowledge would
change their behavior too Two weeks periods of this study
cannot explain in more detail about it Overmore lack of follow
up and do they read from other sources are our limitation in this
study However we found out that pregnant women knowledge
could be increased through the educational page feature in
Jakpros application
CONCLUSION
We found the educational page feature in Jakpros mobile
health application had the positive benefit in serving
reproductive health knowledge In addition knowledge could
make pregnant women more aware of their condition during
pregnancy and be able to prevent unwanted things Jakpros
application is helping the doctor to spread reliable information
The further study is needed to see do the changes in knowledge
will be followed by changes in behavior In the next day we
hope Jakpros application will reveal and contribute for
decreasing Indonesian Maternal Mortality Rate

Our purpose in this study was to examine and analyze the
effectiveness of the educational page feature in Jakpros
application for increasing pregnant women knowledge Most of
them were answered the correct answer in the very first pre test
Need to know that of participants had a high level in the
educational background college and above We could see
the post test differences in their correct answered At the end of
using Jakpros in the second week There was a change in their
knowledge even though did not significantly The previous
study found that reproduction health knowledge was used as a
first step to decrease the maternal mortality rate Besides that
among the other factor knowledge is the easiest way to
implement in daily Health information availability could
change people behavior during pregnancy People would be

The reduction of maternal mortality and the promotion of maternal health and wellbeing are complex tasks This
Series paper analyses the distal and proximal determinants of maternal health as well as the exposures risk factors
and micro correlates related to maternal mortality This paper also examines the relationship between these
determinants and the gradual shift over time from a pattern of high maternal mortality to a pattern of low maternal
mortality a phenomenon described as the maternal mortality transition We conducted two systematic reviews of the
literature and we analysed publicly available data on indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals
specifically estimates prepared by international organisations including the UN and the World Bank We considered
frameworks depicting maternal health and wellbeing as a multifactorial process with superdeterminants that
broadly affect women s health and wellbeing before during and after pregnancy We explore the role of social
determinants of maternal health individual characteristics and health system features in the production of maternal
health and wellbeing This paper argues that the preventable deaths of millions of women each decade are not solely
due to biomedical complications of pregnancy childbirth and the postnatal period but are also tangible manifestations
of the prevailing determinants of maternal health and persistent inequities in global health and socioeconomic
development This paper underscores the need for broader multipronged actions to improve maternal health and
wellbeing and accelerate sustainable reductions in maternal mortality For women who have pregnancy childbirth or
postpartum complications the health system provides a crucial opportunity to interrupt the chain of events that can
potentially end in maternal death Ultimately expanding the health sector ecosystem to mitigate maternal health
determinants and tailoring the configuration of health systems to counter the detrimental effects of eco social forces
including though increased access to quality assured commodities and services are essential to improve maternal
health and wellbeing and reduce maternal mortality
Introduction
In world leaders committed to promoting peace
prosperity health and global cooperation to ensure
the sustainability of human civilisation by setting
the Sustainable Development Goals SDGs However
emerging priorities such as the COVID pandemic
with its evolving consequences the pressing climate
emergency conflicts and political instabilities have
competed for attention and resources In this context
previous and persistent challenges such as maternal
mortality risk being neglected At the halfway mark to
the goal of reaching a global maternal mortality ratio
MMR of maternal deaths per livebirths
remains elusive with maternal deaths per live
births reported in This figure is much less than the
MMR for which was maternal deaths per
livebirths However since the MMR has
decreased in only two regions central and south Asia and
Australia and New Zealand Sub Saharan Africa Oceania
excluding Australia and New Zealand east and southeast
Asia and north Africa all experienced a stagnation in the
MMR During this time period the MMR increased in
Europe North America Latin America and the Caribbean
The reported stagnation in global MMR is an urgent
matter an estimated women died from causes

related to pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum
period in alone The preventable loss of almost
million lives of women between and is not
only a global tragedy but also an indicator of gross health
inequality between and within countries and a flagrant
human rights violation Despite the large gains made in
many countries in terms of improved agency education
employment and fertility desires for women these
advances have not been universal most maternal
deaths remain preventable and are largely clustered
among groups of socioeconomically disadvantaged
women Disease outbreaks conflicts and other public
health emergencies aggravate the situation by increasing
the risk of pregnancy complications disrupting health
systems and posing additional constraints to maternal
and perinatal healthcare
The most common approach to tackling maternal
mortality by the global community has been to direct
investments to address the leading biomedical causes of
maternal death particularly during the perinatal period
Compared with biomedical causes less attention has been
paid to the underlying determinants of adverse pregnancy
and childbirth outcomes and how health systems could be
configured to implement effective interventions and
mitigate the adverse effects of social factors on maternal

Key messages
Maternal health is a social issue maternal ill health and disability are not just medical
problems but outcomes of a complex interplay of eco social forces lifestyles and
exposures and individual level factors
Focusing solely on biomedical causes of maternal mortality is insufficient and has
possibly been the cause of many countries remaining at the same maternal mortality
transition stage for decades out of countries analysed have been in the same
maternal mortalitytransition stage for years
Addressing maternal health issues and reducing maternal mortality are complex
endeavours due to both modifiable and unmodifiable factors that affect outcomes
a broad multipronged approach including promotion of social development and
gender equality at national level will be necessary to tackle determinants that act
upstream in the chain of events that leads to severe morbidity and death
The health sector has a crucial role in saving the lives of women with pregnancy
labour or postpartum complications and should be expanded to mitigate the
detrimental effects of maternal health determinants
Expanding demand for and access to high quality reproductive health services and
commodities including safe abortion modern contraception and antenatal
intrapartum and postpartum care are needed for primary prevention early
identification and adequate management of pregnancy labour and postpartum
complications
Achieving universal health coverage is essential to ensure access to quality care during
pregnancy childbirth and the postpartum period and to reduce maternal mortality
