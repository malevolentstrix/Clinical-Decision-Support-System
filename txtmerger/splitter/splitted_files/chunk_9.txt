different
pharmacokinetic properties utilizing one medium for measuring metal
mixtures may not represent exposure for each metal or accurately reflect
overall human exposure Moreover for different metals each medium
may also represent a different window of exposure that provides
important information in relation to the health outcome of interest
A set of biomarkers reflecting integrated metal mixture information
from multiple media not only reduces the error in the exposure esti
mation but also captures different exposure sources and pathways
Thus it may be appropriate to combine exposure from different media to
assess human exposure to both single metal and metal mixtures Previ
ous studies have proposed different techniques to integrate biomarkers
of exposure to single chemicals including confirmatory factor analysis
Budtz et al Grandjean and Budtz
structural equation models Grandjean and Budtz Kim
et al Heilmann et al and the derivation of multi media
biomarkers MMBs through mixture methods non negative matrix
factorization NMF independent component analysis ICA and
weighted quantile sum WQS regression Levin Schwartz et al
A few studies have modeled metal mixtures measured in multiple
matrices simultaneously and demonstrated that a combination of
different metal biomarker factors may improve the prediction of health
outcomes Rechtman et al Bauer et al Those studies have
validated techniques to select the most important biomarker for each
exposure individually which has provided useful information for rec
ommending a more suitable biomarker for a single metal To our
knowledge very few epidemiological studies have evaluated the overall
performance of simple metal mixtures up to metals measured in
different media in association with health outcomes Levin Schwartz
et al Sanders et al
Therefore our goals were to assess
whether data on a wide panel of metal mixture exposures measured
using different media can be integrated and compare the performance of
different matrices when assessing the relationship between metal mix
tures and birth outcomes
To achieve this goal we conducted the following study First we
proposed ways to integrate multi media exposure information from
biomarkers measured in different media Second we assessed the per
formance of metal mixtures measured in different media and the com
bined multi media exposure as related to health outcomes We chose
adverse birth outcomes as our outcome of interest because exposure to
metals impacts various biological pathways that contribute to adverse
birth outcomes including preterm delivery and low birthweight Kim

Kim et al Signes Pastor et al Govarts et al
Luo et al Lee et al In the Puerto Rico PROTECT study we
measured a wide range of metals in paired urine and blood samples
which enabled us to compare the associations between adverse birth
outcomes and urinary or blood metal mixtures as well as integrated
metal mixtures utilizing both matrices We hypothesized that the use of
urine blood and the integrated metal mixtures would demonstrate
differing performance when modeling adverse birth outcomes inform

Descriptive statistics were calculated for all exposures and outcome

analysis of the relationships between paired urinary and blood metal

MMB composition
In this analysis we proposed two approaches to integrate exposure
information from urinary and blood metal measurements into a multi
media biomarker MMB In the first approach inspired by the
concept of cue combination in quantitative cognitive neurosciences the
minimum variance unbiased estimator for multiple sources of informa
tion we used an internal reliability indicator of the biomarkers to
integrate MMB unsupervised method In the second approach which is
a supervised method weighted quantile sum WQS models were used
because the relative contribution of the individual biomarkers to the
overall exposure and health outcome association is easier to interpret
than many other mixtures methods The details of the approaches are
described below
Integrating multi media biomarker MMB using intraclass corre
lation coefficient ICC Characterizing the within and between
individual variation of measurements with parameters such as intra
class correlation coefficient ICC gives information on the reliability of
the different media biomarkers ICC is defined as the proportion of the
Wi l

particular metal is a relatively reliable biomarker and C is the geometric

Integrating multi media biomarker MMB using weighted quantile
sum regression WQS In addition to the unsupervised learning method
the amount of exposure information each biomarker carries can be
quantified simultaneously based on the relationship of the exposure
measured in a certain medium and health effect a supervised approach
Therefore the second approach for integrating urinary and blood bio
markers was weighted quantile sum regression WQS which models
the body burden of quantiles of exposure WQS estimates a set of
weights such that the linear combinations of the weights quantile
biomarkers have the highest association with the outcome Carrico

equation Details of the WQS equation and annotations
are previously described Yorita Christensen et al In our anal
ysis Wi is the unknown weight for the ith medium urine blood
c z represents a vector of adjusted covariates and P is a vector of
regression coefficients for those covariates By placing the constraints of
the weight WD estimates to be non negative and sum to the
comparative values of urine and blood metals to multi media bio
markers and the joint effect can be determined The weights can then be
used to quantify the contribution of each medium to the multi media
biomarker In this supervised learning approach we used WQS
bootstraps to determine the association between each birth outcome
and urinary and blood biomarkers of each metal separately A pre
liminary analysis was conducted before the construction of WQS models
As WQS assumes linearity in an effort to detect potential non linear
relationships between individual metals and birth outcomes we used
generalized additive models GAM to graphically depict the metal and
birth outcome relationship Results from GAM including metal concen
trations as splines and the GAM output graphics showed that when the
smoothing estimator is significant the observed associations are linear

In epidemiological studies with repeated measurements the ICC
metric ranging from O to indicates reliability among multiple mea

between repeated measures a k a poor ability to distinguish between
individuals with high and low exposure levels when close to the
repeated measures are close to each other which reflects a good ability to
discriminate between individuals with high and low exposure levels In
this unsupervised machine learning approach we utilized the ICCs
calculated from repeated measurements of SG corrected urinary up to
three visits and blood metals up to two visits Ashrap et al as
weighting parameters to construct an integrated MMB separately for
each metal using equations

Construction of environmental risk scores ERSs using ridge
regression Environmental Risk Score ERS was proposed as a potential
summary measure for the effects of mixtures in epidemiologic research
Park et al
The concept of ERS is to build a predictive risk model
as a weighted sum of the exposure levels from simultaneous assessment
of the all the pollutants in the mixture Weights are determined by the
magnitudes standardized regression coefficients of the association
between each exposure and the outcome of interest
Park et al
We constructed Environmental Risk Scores ERSs as weighted summary
measures of the effects of metals where the weights were regression
coefficients derived from models of the association between metal
mixtures and the outcome of interest We utilized Ridge regression to
guide the weight of each metal in relation to preterm birth Ridge

The in

our analytic purpose was to evaluate the same full set of metals as
mixtures across different media and integrated biomarkers that have
different directions of individual metal birth outcome associations

of metals and covariates we performed fold cross validation and

metal exposure From a risk stratification perspective integration of
urine and blood biomarkers that were derived from both ICC and WQS
approaches improved the model performance in the mixture models
compared to the sole urine or blood biomarker models Although the
confidence intervals for these odds ratio estimates were wider the MMB
integration especially using the WQS approach resulted in substantially
higher effect estimate This finding supports that while multiple mea
surements of the exposure mixture may measure metal body burden
differentially there may still be room for improvement for exposure
measurement error structure and effect estimate when incorporating
urinary and blood biomarker information
Strengths and limitations
Specific strengths of our study include its longitudinal design in
which repeated urinary and blood biomarkers provided more accurate
exposure information during pregnancy This allowed us to quantify the
temporal reliability of the two media measurements ICCs which were
further used as weights to integrate the multi media measure of expo
sure Secondly this study utilized data driven machine learning ap
proaches to inform the composition of multi media metal biomarkers
measured in different media and guide the construction of environ
mental risk scores for each medium reflecting the overall exposure to the
metal mixture Finally this study evaluated the health effects of multiple
metals simultaneously and compared the performance of different
media biomarkers and integrated biomarkers in relation to adverse birth
outcomes in the context of a mixture The results lay the groundwork for
future epidemiological studies on biomarker selection when examining
the mixture effects of metals
However our study has several limitations The relatively small
sample size did not allow cross validation within this population on ERS
which may have caused overfitting of ERS Future studies with a larger
sample size should implement training and test datasets to cross validate
ERSs Studies with larger sample sizes are also needed to address po
tential improvement of models by including non linear terms and in
teractions between metals and covariates that were not accounted for in
the current analysis Depending on the pharmacokinetics of each
chemical within a family mixture studies in general are challenged by
the complications of combining chemical biomarkers where each may
be representing a unique window of exposure While our ERS estimates
also suffered from this limitation by combining multi media exposure
using both urine and blood biomarkers we were able to reduce the
measurement error in the mixture analysis to an extent Because the
average concentrations of metal biomarkers across three visits were used
in this analysis windows of vulnerability during pregnancy were not
evaluated Given that associations between metal mixtures and birth
outcomes may depend on developmental time windows it is important
for future longitudinal studies to evaluate the temporality of the asso
ciations In addition while we evaluated a mixture of essential and
non essential metals it is possible that other metals that were not
assessed in our study affect the performance of urine or blood bio
markers Future work is needed to expand the mixture evaluation to
include more metals and other biospecimens including hair and saliva
as well as other adverse health outcomes because our results may not be
generalizable to other outcomes of interest Finally while the mixture of
metals in this study is representative of exposures experienced by Puerto
Rican populations it may not accurately reflect exposure profiles for
other populations
Conclusions
Our study used innovative methodology to provide new detailed
insights into the individual and integrated associations of urinary and
blood mixture biomarkers of metal exposure with birth outcomes Our
investigation demonstrates within practical metal analytical panels
that measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
Environmental Research
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture The results of our study
elucidate the importance of considering the overall mixture perfor
mance of a certain medium Future studies are needed to expand to
evaluate the performance with different metal panels media health
outcomes of interest and methods to integrate exposure information to
further address how to most effectively study the health impacts of

ABSTRACT
Background Studies on the health effects of metal mixtures typically utilize biomarkers measured in a single
biological medium such as blood or urine However the ability to evaluate mixture effects are limited by the
uncertainty whether a unified medium can fully capture exposure for each metal Therefore it is important to
compare and assess metal mixtures measured in different media in epidemiology studies
Objectives The aim of this study was to examine the mixture predictive performance of urine and blood metal
biomarkers and integrated multi media biomarkers in association with birth outcomes
Methods In our analysis of women from the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort we measured essential and
non essential metals in repeated and paired samples of urine and blood during pregnancy For each metal we
integrated exposure estimates from paired urine and blood biomarkers into multi media biomarkers MMBs
using intraclass correlation coefficient ICC and weighted quantile sum WQS approaches Using Ridge re
gressions four separate Environmental risk scores ERSs for metals in urine blood and MMBvvQs were
computed as a weighted sum of the metal concentrations We then examined associations between urine
blood and multi media biomarker ERSs and birth outcomes using linear and logistic regressions adjusting for
maternal age maternal education pre pregnancy body mass index BMI and second hand smoke exposure The
performance of each ERS was evaluated with continuous and tertile estimates and confidence intervals of
the odds ratio of preterm birth using area under the curve AUC
Results Pb was the most important contributor of blood ERS as well as the two integrated multi media biomarker
ERSs Individuals with high ERS tertile showed increased odds of preterm birth compared to individuals
with low ERS tertile with fold CI to for urine specific gravity corrected fold
CI to for blood fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using ICC
and fold CI to for multi media biomarkers composed using WQS The four ERSs had
comparable predictive performances AUC ranging from to when urine is examined with specific
gravity corrected concentrations
Conclusions Within a practical metal panel measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture Applications in practical study design require validation of these
methods with other cohorts larger panels of metals and within the context of other adverse health effects of
interest

Introduction
Exposure biomonitoring which estimates human exposure by
measuring chemical or other agents of interest or their metabolic
products in different biologic media such as blood and urine Strimbu
has become a fundamental approach used in exposure
and Tavel
assessment and environmental epidemiology

growing interest in the realistic scenario of studying the collective ef
fects of environmental chemicals on humans including metals Taylor

Luo et al Lee et al Braun et al Berger et al
Kalioo et al
biomonitoring has become indispensable in
studies of mixtures Due to limiting factors such as financial cost and
methodologic challenges mixture studies based on biomarkers typically
use a unified human specimen i e blood urine etc to determine
exposure to various chemicals Singh et al Martin and Griswold
Borowska and Brzoska Rehman et al Gorman Ng
et al Ashrap et al
While this approach may capture
overall exposure to a class of chemicals with similar structure and
pharmacokinetic properties such as urinary phthalates and blood per
fluorinated compounds PFAS it is more challenging to evaluate
chemical classes such as metals Because each metal possesses different
pharmacokinetic properties utilizing one medium for measuring metal
mixtures may not represent exposure for each metal or accurately reflect
overall human exposure Moreover for different metals each medium
may also represent a different window of exposure that provides
important information in relation to the health outcome of interest
A set of biomarkers reflecting integrated metal mixture information
from multiple media not only reduces the error in the exposure esti
mation but also captures different exposure sources and pathways
Thus it may be appropriate to combine exposure from different media to
assess human exposure to both single metal and metal mixtures Previ
ous studies have proposed different techniques to integrate biomarkers
of exposure to single chemicals including confirmatory factor analysis
