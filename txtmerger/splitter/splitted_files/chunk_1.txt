Physical Activity and Exercise During Pregnancy and
the Postpartum Period
ABSTRACT Exercise defined as physical activity consisting of planned structured and repetitive bodily
movements done to improve one or more components of physical fitness is an essential element of a healthy
lifestyle and obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should encourage their patients to
continue or to commence exercise as an important component of optimal health Women who habitually engaged
in vigorous intensity aerobic activity or who were physically active before pregnancy can continue these activities
during pregnancy and the postpartum period Observational studies of women who exercise during pregnancy
have shown benefits such as decreased gestational diabetes mellitus cesarean birth and operative vaginal deliv
ery and postpartum recovery time Physical activity also can be an essential factor in the prevention of depressive
disorders of women in the postpartum period Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are associated
with minimal risks and have been shown to benefit most women although some modification to exercise routines
may be necessary because of normal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal requirements In the absence of
obstetric or medical complications or contraindications physical activity in pregnancy is safe and desirable and
pregnant women should be encouraged to continue or to initiate safe physical activities This document has been
revised to incorporate recent evidence regarding the benefits and risks of physical activity and exercise during
pregnancy and the postpartum period
Recommendations
Regular physical activity in all phases of life including
pregnancy promotes health benefits Pregnancy is an
ideal time for maintaining or adopting a healthy lifestyle
and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecol
ogists makes the following recommendations
Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are
associated with minimal risks and have been shown
to benefit most women although some modification
to exercise routines may be necessary because of
normal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal
requirements
A thorough clinical evaluation should be conducted
before recommending an exercise program to ensure
that a patient does not have a medical reason to avoid
exercise
VOL NO APRIL
Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be
encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength
conditioning exercises before during and after
pregnancy
Obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should evaluate women with medical or
obstetric complications carefully before making rec
ommendations on physical activity participation during
pregnancy Activity restriction should not be prescribed
routinely as a treatment to reduce preterm birth
Additional research is needed to study the effects of
exercise on pregnancy specific conditions and out
comes and to clarify further effective behavioral coun
seling methods and the optimal type frequency and
intensity of exercise Similar research is needed to create
an improved evidence base concerning the effects of
occupational physical activity on maternal fetal health
OBSTETRICS GYNECOLOGY
Introduction
This document has been revised to incorporate recent
evidence regarding the benefits and risks of physical
activity and exercise during pregnancy and the post
partum period Physical activity defined as any bodily
movement produced by the contraction of skeletal
muscles in all stages of life maintains and improves
cardiorespiratory fitness reduces the risk of obesity and
associated comorbidities and results in greater longev
ity Women who begin their pregnancy with a healthy
lifestyle eg exercise good nutrition nonsmoking
should be encouraged to maintain those healthy habits
Women who do not have healthy lifestyles should be
encouraged to view the prepregnancy period and preg
nancy as opportunities to embrace healthier routines
Exercise defined as physical activity consisting of
planned structured and repetitive bodily movements
done to improve one or more components of physical
fitness is an essential element of a healthy lifestyle
and obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should encourage their patients to continue
or to commence exercise as an important component of
optimal health
The World Health Organization and the American
College of Sports Medicine have issued evidence based
recommendations indicating that the beneficial effects of
exercise in most adults are indisputable and that the
benefits far outweigh the risks
The update to the U S Department of Health
and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for
Americans reinforces prior recommendations of at least
minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity per
week during pregnancy and the postpartum period
This activity should be spread throughout the week The
guidelines advise that women who habitually engaged in
vigorous intensity aerobic activity or who were physi
cally active before pregnancy can continue these activi
ties during pregnancy and the postpartum period
Additionally women who are pregnant should be under
the care of an obstetrician gynecologist or other obstetric
care provider who can monitor the progress of the preg
nancy Women who are pregnant can consult their
obstetrician gynecologist or other obstetric care pro
vider about whether or how to adjust their physical
activity during pregnancy and postpartum
Physical inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor
for early mortality worldwide In pregnancy physical
inactivity and excessive weight gain have been recog
nized as independent risk factors for maternal obesity
and related pregnancy complications including gesta
tional diabetes mellitus GDM Concerns that reg
ular physical activity during pregnancy may cause
miscarriage poor fetal growth musculoskeletal injury
or premature delivery have not been substantiated for
women with uncomplicated pregnancies In the
absence of obstetric or medical complications or contra
indications physical activity in pregnancy is safe and
desirable and pregnant women should be encouraged
to continue or to initiate safe physical activities Box
Box
Most pregnant patients can exercise There are few
maternal medical conditions in which aerobic exercise is
absolutely contraindicated When questions exist regard
ing safety of aerobic exercise in pregnancy consultation
with relevant specialists and subspecialists eg obstetrics
and gynecology maternal fetal medicine cardiology
pulmonology when indicated is advised In women
who have obstetric or medical comorbidities exercise
regimens should be individualized Obstetrician
gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should
evaluate women with medical or obstetric complications
carefully before making recommendations on physical
activity participation during pregnancy
Anatomic and Physiologic Aspects of
Exercise in Pregnancy
Pregnancy results in anatomic and physiologic changes
that should be considered when prescribing exercise The
most distinct changes during pregnancy are weight gain
and a shift in the point of gravity that results in
progressive lordosis These changes lead to an increase
in the forces across joints and the spine during weight
bearing exercise As a result more than of all
pregnant women experience low back pain
Strengthening
abdominal and back muscles
could minimize this risk Blood volume heart rate stroke
volume and cardiac output normally increase during
pregnancy and systemic vascular resistance decreases
Table These hemodynamic changes establish the cir
culatory reserve necessary to sustain the pregnant
woman and fetus at rest and during exercise Maintain
ing a supine position during exercise after weeks of
gestation may result in decreased venous return due to
aortocaval compression from the gravid uterus leading
to hypotension and this hemodynamic change should be

considered when prescribing exercise modifications in
pregnancy
In pregnancy there also are profound respiratory
changes Minute ventilation increases up to pri
marily as a result of the increased tidal volume Because
of a physiologic decrease in pulmonary reserve the
ability to exercise anaerobically is impaired and oxygen
availability for aerobic exercise and increased work load
consistently lags The physiologic respiratory alkalosis of
pregnancy may not be sufficient to compensate for the
developing metabolic acidosis of strenuous exercise
Decreases in subjective work load and maximum exercise
performance in pregnant women particularly in those
who are overweight or obese limit their ability to engage
in more strenuous physical activities Aerobic train
ing in pregnancy has been shown to increase aerobic
capacity in normal weight and overweight pregnant
women
Temperature regulation is highly dependent on
hydration and environmental conditions During exer
cise pregnant women should stay well hydrated wear
loose fitting clothing and avoid high heat and humidity
to protect against heat stress particularly during the first
trimester Although exposure to heat from sources
such as hot tubs saunas or fever has been associated
with an increased risk of neural tube defects exer
cise would not be expected to increase core body tem
perature into the range of concern At least one study
found no association between exercise and neural tube
defects
Fetal Response to Maternal Exercise
Most of the studies addressing fetal response to maternal
exercise have focused on fetal heart rate changes and
birth weight Studies have demonstrated minimum to
moderate increases in fetal heart rate by beats
per minute over the baseline during or after exercise
Three meta analyses concluded that the dif
ferences in birth weight were minimal to none in
women who exercised during pregnancy compared
with controls However women who contin
ued to exercise vigorously during the third trimester
were more likely to deliver infants weighing g
less than comparable controls although there was not
an increased risk of fetal growth restriction A
cohort study that assessed umbilical artery blood flow
fetal heart rates and biophysical profiles before and
after strenuous exercise in the second trimester dem
onstrated that minutes of strenuous exercise was
well tolerated by women and fetuses in active and
inactive pregnant women More data are needed
from athletes who may exert beyond the accepted vig
orous definition of up to of capacity and it is
possible that there is an absolute level of intensity or
duration or both that exists and if exceeded could
place the fetus at risk Individualized exercise prescrip
tions may be warranted in pregnant athletes to ascer
tain whether there is a threshold beyond which fetal
well being may be compromised
Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy
The benefits of exercise during pregnancy are numerous
Box Regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy
has been shown to improve or maintain physical fitness
Observational studies of women who exercise
during pregnancy have shown benefits such as
decreased GDM Odds Ratio OR Cl
cesarean birth Relative Risk
CI and operative vaginal
delivery and postpartum recovery time
Physical activity also can be an essential factor in the
prevention of depressive disorders of women in the
postpartum period In pregnancy greater self
reported overall physical fitness and cardiorespiratory
fitness are associated with less bodily pain lumbar and
sciatic pain and reduced pain disability Studies
are needed to explore whether improving physical fit
ness before and during pregnancy could decrease pain
during the peripartum period
A randomized controlled trial that included
overweight or obese women with uncomplicated
singleton gestations at less than weeks of gestation
found that cycling exercises initiated in the first trimester
and performed at least minutes times per week until
weeks of gestation significantly reduced the incidence
of GDM significantly reduced gestational weight gain at
less than weeks of gestation and lowered neonatal
birth weight Although these investigators found no
significant differences between the exercise and control
groups in the incidence of other outcomes such as pre
term birth gestational hypertension cesarean birth and
macrosomia all these outcomes were less frequent in the
exercise group

Recommending an Exercise Program
Motivational Counseling
Pregnancy is an ideal time for behavior modification and
adoption of a healthy lifestyle because of increased
motivation and frequent access to medical supervision
Patients are more likely to control weight increase
physical activity and improve their diet if their physician
recommends that they do so Motivational counsel
ing tools such as the Five A s Ask Advise Assess Assist
and Arrange originally developed for smoking cessa
tion have been used successfully for diet and exercise
counseling Obstetrician gynecologists and
Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period
other obstetric care providers can consider adopting the
Five A s approach for women with uncomplicated
pregnancies who have no contraindications to exercise
Prescribing an Individualized Exercise Program
The principles of exercise prescription for pregnant
women do not differ from those for the general
population A thorough clinical evaluation should
be conducted before recommending an exercise program
to ensure that a patient does not have a medical reason to
avoid exercise An exercise program that leads to an
eventual goal of moderate intensity exercise for at least
minutes per day on most or all days of the week
should be developed with the patient and adjusted as
medically indicated
Because blunted and normal heart rate responses to
exercise have been reported in pregnant women the use
of ratings of perceived exertion may be a more effective
means to monitor exercise intensity during pregnancy
than heart rate parameters For moderate intensity
exercise ratings of perceived exertion should be
somewhat hard on the Borg ratings of perceived exer
tion scale Table Using the talk test is another way
to measure exertion as long as a woman can carry on
a conversation while exercising she likely is not over
exerting herself Women should be advised to
remain well hydrated avoid long periods of lying flat
on their backs and stop exercising if they have any of
the warning signs listed in Box
Pregnant women who were sedentary before preg
nancy should follow a more gradual progression of

exercise Although an upper level of safe exercise
intensity has not been established women who were
regular exercisers before pregnancy and who have
uncomplicated healthy pregnancies should be able to
engage in high intensity exercise programs such as
jogging and aerobics with no adverse effects High
intensity or prolonged exercise in excess of minutes
can lead to hypoglycemia therefore adequate caloric
intake before exercise or limiting the intensity or length
of the exercise session is essential to minimize this risk
Prolonged exercise should be performed in a ther
moneutral environment or in controlled environmental
conditions facilities with air conditioning and pregnant
women should avoid prolonged exposure to heat
and pay close attention to proper hydration and caloric
intake In studies of pregnant women who exercised in
which physical activity was self paced in a temperature
controlled environment core body temperatures rose
less than over minutes and stayed within safe
limits Table lists suggestions for an exercise plan
in pregnancy Finally although physical activity and
dehydration in pregnancy have been associated with
a small increase in uterine contractions a sys
tematic review and meta analysis in normal weight preg
nant women with singleton uncomplicated gestations
demonstrated that exercise for minutes
times per week is not associated with an increased risk of
preterm birth or with a reduction in mean gestational age
at delivery

Special Populations
Pregnant Women With Obesity
Pregnant women with obesity should be encouraged to
engage in a healthy lifestyle modification in pregnancy
that includes physical activities and judicious diets
Women should start with low intensity short periods of
exercise and gradually increase the period or intensity of
exercise as they are able In recent studies examining the
effects of exercise among pregnant women with obesity
women assigned to exercise demonstrated modest reduc
tions in weight gain and no adverse outcomes

rate Competitive athletes require frequent and close
supervision because they tend to maintain a more stren
uous training schedule throughout pregnancy and
resume high intensity training postpartum sooner than
other women Such athletes should pay particular atten
tion to avoiding hyperthermia maintaining proper
hydration and sustaining adequate caloric intake to pre
vent weight loss which may adversely affect fetal growth
An elite athlete can be defined generally as an athlete
with several years of experience in a particular sport or
sports who has competed successfully against other high
level performers and trains year round at a high level an
elite athlete generally trains at least days per week
averaging close to hours per day throughout the year
In addition to aerobic training elite athletes in most
sports also participate in resistance training to increase
muscular strength and endurance however this training
was not considered a safe activity in early guidelines for
exercise during pregnancy because of potential injury
and possible fetal heart decelerations resulting from Val
salva maneuvers Consequently there is sparse literature
on this topic It is prudent for elite athletes who wish
to continue strenuous activity during pregnancy to have
a clear understanding of the risks to obtain approval
from their health care providers and to consider decreas
ing resistance load compared with prepregnant condi
tions High impact activities with increased risk of
blunt trauma should be avoided and it also is important
that the pregnant elite athlete avoid overheating when
performing their sport or participating in intense train
ing
Activity Restriction

evidence to prescribe bed rest in pregnancy for the
prevention of preterm labor and it should not be routinely
recommended Patients prescribed prolonged bed
rest or restricted physical activity are at risk of venous
Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period
most of the estimates of risk pointed to small or null
effects In contrast a cohort study of more than
Danish women reported a dose response relationship
between total daily burden lifted and preterm birth with
loads more than kg per day In this study
lifting heavy loads greater than kg more than
times per day was associated with an increased risk of
preterm birth
The National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health uses an equation that determines the
maximum recommended weight limit for lifting that
would be acceptable to of healthy women
This equation has been used to define recommended
weight limits for a broad range of lifting patterns for
pregnant women as well as lifting conditions that pose
a higher risk of musculoskeletal injury Fig
Obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers can use their best clinical judgment to
determine a recommended plan for the patient This
plan may include a formal request for an occupational
health professional to perform an analysis to deter
mine maximum weight limits based on actual lifting
condition or assist with writing appropriate letters to
employers to help obtain accommodations
Exercise in the Postpartum Period
Several reports indicate that women s level of participa
tion in exercise programs diminishes after childbirth
frequently leading to overweight and obesity
The postpartum period is an opportune time for
obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care pro
viders to recommend and reinforce a healthy lifestyle
Resuming exercise or incorporating new exercise rou
tines after delivery is important in supporting lifelong
healthy habits Exercise routines may be resumed grad
ually after pregnancy as soon as medically safe de
pending on the mode of delivery vaginal or cesarean
birth and the presence or absence of medical or surgical
complications Some women are capable of resuming
physical activities within days of delivery Pelvic floor
exercises can be initiated in the immediate postpartum
period Abdominal strengthening exercises including
abdominal crunch exercises and the drawing in exercise
a maneuver that increases abdominal pressure by pulling
in the abdominal wall muscles have been shown to
decrease the incidence of diastasis recti abdominus and
decrease the inter rectus distance in women who gave
birth vaginally or by cesarean birth
Regular aerobic exercise in lactating women has
been shown to improve maternal cardiovascular fitness
without affecting milk production composition or
infant growth Women who are lactating should
consider feeding their infants or expressing milk before
exercising to avoid discomfort of engorged breasts They
also should ensure adequate hydration before commenc
Conclusion
Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are associated
with minimal risks and have been shown to benefit most
women although some modification to exercise routines
may be necessary because of normal anatomic and
physiologic changes and fetal requirements In the
absence of obstetric or medical complications or contra
indications physical activity in pregnancy is safe and
desirable and pregnant women should be encouraged to
continue or to initiate safe physical activities
Obstetrician gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should evaluate women with medical or
obstetric complications carefully before making recom
mendations on physical activity participation during
pregnancy Although the evidence is limited exercise
results in benefits to pregnancy outcomes and there is no
evidence of harm when exercise is not contraindicated
Physical activity and exercise during pregnancy promote
physical fitness and may prevent excessive gestational
weight gain Exercise may reduce the risk of gestational
diabetes preeclampsia and cesarean birth Additional
research is needed to study the effects of exercise on
pregnancy specific conditions and outcomes and to clar
ify further effective behavioral counseling methods and
the optimal type frequency and intensity of exercise
Similar research is needed to create an improved evi
dence base concerning the effects of occupational phys
ical activity on maternal fetal health

Background Being obese can lead to various complications during pregnancy such as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
GDM pregnancy induced hypertension PIH Pre Eclampsia PE and Large Gestational Age LGA Although bariatric
surgery is an effective way to treat obesity it can also result in complications and may be linked to having small for
gestational age SGA babies This cohort study protocol aims to compare the maternal and fetal neonatal outcomes of two
groups of Iranian pregnant women those who have undergone bariatric surgery and those who are obese but have not had
bariatric surgery Methods In this study Pregnant women weeks gestation n per group are recruited either
from one of the obesity clinic exposure group with a history of bariatric surgery or primary healthcare clinics in Tehran
city comparison group pregnant women with obesity and and no history of bariatric surgery Dietary intake and nutrient
status are assessed at and weeks Maternal and fetal neonatal outcomes are compared between the two
groups including gestational diabetes preeclampsia preterm labor intrauterine growth restriction severe nausea and
vomiting abortion placenta previa and abruption venous thrombosis vaginal bleeding cesarean delivery meconium
aspiration and respiratory distress Maternal serum levels of ferritin albumin zinc calcium magnesium selenium copper
vitamins A and hydroxy Vit D are checked during to weeks Maternal and neonatal outcomes
including height weight head circumference fetal abnormality infection small or large fetus low birth weight macrosomia
NICU admission and total weight gain during pregnancy are measured at birth Maternal and offspring outcomes including
weight height head circumference total weight gain during pregnancy newborn diseases postpartum bleeding
breastfeeding and related problems are assessed weeks after delivery Child s weight height and head circumference
are followed at and months after birth Maternal stress anxiety and depression are assessed with the
DASS questionnaire and physical activity is evaluated using the PPAQ questionnaire in the first and third trimesters
Discussion By assessing the levels of micronutrients in the blood of pregnant women along with the evaluation of
pregnancy outcomes it is feasible to gain a more accurate understanding of how bariatric surgery affects the health and
potential complications for both the mother and the fetus newborn This information can help specialists and patients make
more informed decisions about the surgery Additionally by examining issues such as stress anxiety and depression in
women undergoing surgery this study can contribute to recognizing these problems which can also affect pregnancy
outcomes The Author s
