Introduction
ABSTRACT
Despite the increased availability of family planning services FPS in low income countries their use remains
low especially in rural sub Saharan Africa To investigate to what extent this is explained by the husband s
involvement in the decision process we use an experiment in rural Tanzania in which couples choose between
two payments one being conditional on attending a family planning meeting at a health center Experimentally
varying the husband s involvement we find that FPS are more likely chosen in treatments that involve the
husband Exploring potential mechanisms we show that this is driven by couples where the wife incorrectly
believes that the husband disapproves of contraceptives We also find that involving the husband increases
the wife s expectation that the family planning meeting will be attended Both findings suggest that initiating
communication between spouses could reduce demand constraints
Family planning FP aims to help couples have their desired num
ber of children and control the spacing and timing of births This has
important benefits for couples and their children in low and middle
income countries LMICs l Large efforts have been made to provide
family planning services FPS at low costs in LMICs UNFPA
However women s unmet need for FP remains high in most countries
in sub Saharan Africa particularly in rural areas UN DESA
Izugbara et al This lack of progress suggests that important
constraints remain on the demand side Ashraf et al
Several field experiments have analyzed whether the low uptake of
FPS can be explained by the degree of the husband s involvement in the
decision process but the evidence is mixed First Ashraf et al
found that involving the husband lowers the uptake of contraceptives
at a local private health clinic This is in line with the idea that by
passing the husband could increase women s uptake of contraceptives
where men want more children and have higher bargaining power

than women as is the case in many low income countries Doepke
and Tertiit World Bank
Second other studies found a
positive effect of the husband s involvement Fisek and Sumbuloglu
Terefe and Larson wang et al McCarthy
which they attribute to better information about FP a change in men s
attitudes and better spousal communication about FP
The conflicting findings of these studies could be due to the different
stage in the decision process on which they focus Specifically Ashraf
et al
gave direct access to free contraceptives and randomized
the husband s involvement in the decision to take up the offer of
contraceptives In the other studies the husband s involvement was
randomized at an earlier stage where couples were provided with
information about FP in their homes i e before they were offered any
contraceptives In this paper we will look at an even earlier stage
whether couples choose to get in touch with the health system to receive
information about FP
This decision has not been studied yet and is important for the
following reasons First in rural areas contraceptives are mostly dis
tributed through FPS offered at health centers and therefore a decision
needs to be made to visit a health center Second even though many
people might already have been in touch with health centers and
received some information about FP e g as part of post natal care
knowledge about FP and the continuity of the use of modern contracep
tives remains low The discontinuation of contraceptives can indicate
that women are not able to make free and informed decisions when it
have inaccurate beliefs about
comes to contraceptives
the efficacy of contraceptives Miller et al or suffer side effects
This emphasizes the need for regular visits to the health center to
ensure that women find a FP method they are satisfied with
Zimmerman et al
Third visiting the nearest health center
in rural areas requires planning due to in most cases substantial
travel needs and the fact that at most health centers FP meetings
are organized at fixed times and days This adds a layer of complexity
caused by the uncertainty that the plan to visit the health center will
be carried out successfully
The involvement of the husband at this stage could influence the
outcome in several ways First spouses could have different preferences
about FPS caused by factors such as fertility preferences current con
traceptive use knowledge about FP and time preferences Second they
might have incomplete information about each other s preferences as
they tend to have little communication about FP As a result women
might be reluctant to use FPS if they believe that their husband disap
proves of them However if the husband actually supports the use of
FPS involving the husband would increase their use Lasee and Becker
Third the uncertainty that plans to visit the health center can
be carried out could create an important barrier for the uptake of FPS
This could be alleviated if the involvement of the husband reduces this
uncertainty
In this paper we investigate whether and why the husband s in
volvement influences a couple s plan to take up FPS offered at the local
health center To do so we use data from a lab in the field experiment
in rural Tanzania in which couples choose between two payments
one being conditional on attending a FP meeting at a local health
facility The experiment models the first stage of the FP decision
making process i e whether to plan to go to the local health facility
where contraceptives are delivered Couples are randomly allocated to
one of three treatments where only the wife only the husband or both
spouses together make the decisions Comparing the decisions made
across these treatments allows us to analyze the causal effect of the
husband s involvement
There are also several qualitative and observational studies that identify
the husbands lack of involvement as a main barrier for the uptake of
Lasee and Becker Sharan and Valente
contraceptives see e g
Shattuck et al Hartmann et al
Journal of Development Economics
We find that involving the husband increases the likelihood that FPS
are chosen Using a theoretical framework we explore three different
mechanisms that can explain this result First we do not find evidence
of the husband having a stronger preference for FPS than the wife
Second we find that the positive effect of the husband s involvement
is driven by women who believe that their husband does not approve
of couples using contraceptives This finding indicates that information
about spousal preferences is incomplete which makes the effect of
the husband s involvement dependent on women s beliefs about their
husband s preferences Finally we also find that the wife is less certain
about whether the plan to attend a FP meeting will be carried out
successfully when the husband is not involved in the decision This
would lower the expected value of the conditional payment when she
makes the decision alone hence making it less attractive
Using data collected after the experiment we find that most couples
who needed to attend a FP meeting to receive a payment attended
such a meeting without any difference across treatments Furthermore
once at the FP meeting a majority of couples received contraceptives
again without any difference across treatments As we will explain in
more detail both findings provide evidence against a potential social
desirability bias which might have confounded the treatment effects
Finally using the treatments as instrumental variables we find that the
condition to attend a FP meeting significantly increases contraceptive
use one month after the experiment
Our paper contributes to two strands of literature First it relates
to the literature on household bargaining over fertility and contra
ceptive use Several studies focus on bargaining over the number of
children to have Klawon and Tiefenthaler Rasul Kim and
Radoias Hener Doepke and Kindermann
Some
experimental studies look at the effect of male involvement on the
uptake of contraceptives on which they find mixed evidence Fisek and
Sumbuloglu Terefe and Larson Wang et al Ashraf
et al McCarthy
Our study differs from these studies
in at least two ways We focus on the uptake of FPS offered by the
existing public health system Moreover we are particularly interested
in whether the involvement of the husband influences couples plans to
use FPS
Second we relate to an emerging literature on incomplete infor
mation within the household While a growing number of studies
demonstrates that information asymmetries over income and choice
set matter for household decision making Castilla and Walker
Munro et al Hoel Jakiela and Ozier these papers
remain silent about the potential effect of incomplete information about
spousal preferences A few studies however do provide evidence of in
complete information about spousal preferences Bateman and Munro
Afzal et al
but remain silent about the consequences this
might have for household decision making When decisions are made
individually and without communication between spouses decisions
are based on beliefs about spousal preferences which might be inaccu
rate In this paper we demonstrate empirically and theoretically how
such beliefs can interact with the effect of the husband s involvement
in household decisions
The remainder of the article proceeds as follows Section provides
details of the experimental design Section presents the main results
and Section explores the mechanisms Section extends the analysis
by using data on contraceptive use after the experiment Section
discusses the results and concludes
Design
In this section we present the setting and the experimental de
sign including a description of the experimental tasks treatments
predictions and how the experiment was implemented
B D and C Ringdal
Setting
We conducted our study in Tanzania which has seen a steady
increase in the use of contraceptives by women aged from
in to in TNBS and Macro
The unmet
need for FP in contrast has been at around for two decades
A variety of governmental and non governmental organizations
have tried to increase the uptake of FPS in the country e g USAID sup
ported organizations
Tanzanian policy on FP and
USAID
contraceptive use aimed to increase modern contraceptive use to
by
United Republic of Tanzania In order to do so one
of the objectives was to reduce demand side constraints by increasing
men s acceptability of FP Multiple targets were used of which the most
important ones include an increase in spousal communication a change
of harmful gender norms to make FP the responsibility of both men
and women and a reduction in gender based violence which negatively
correlates with the use of contraceptives Our focus on the involvement
of men in the decision making process is very much in line with the
government s assessment and action plan
For our study we focus on the Lake zone of Tanzania which has
the highest unmet need for FP in the country In this region we
are interested in the rural population where contraceptive use tends
to be lower TNBS and Macro We selected Misungwi district
which is located kilometers south of Mwanza city and where ninety
percent live in rural settlements
Agriculture is the main
TNBS
economic activity in this district followed by livestock keeping small
scale mining and petty trade of agricultural and livestock products It
is ethnically very homogenous with most households belonging to the
Sukuma tribe which is patrilineal This makes that husbands tend to
have strong decision making power in most household decisions
Experimental task
To identify the effect of the husband s involvement on the use of
FPS we experimentally varied the involvement of the husband in the
decision making process For this we brought couples to a field lab
where they responded to financial incentives when deciding whether to
make use of FPS offered at their nearest health facility The experiment
simulates this decision by asking couples to make a series of choices
between two options A and B Option B was only paid if the wife or
the couple had attended a family planning meeting before the payment
date while option A did not have this condition The chosen option was
paid out one month after the experiment This captures an important
feature of the decision making process where a visit to the nearest
health center in rural areas requires planning In other words when
couples chose between the two options they decided whether to plan
a visit to the health center
We used a list of five pairs of choices in which we kept option
A constant and gradually increased option B The difference between
options A and B varied from TZS to TZS approx US
We used a series of five pairs instead of only one pair to increase
variation among the couples as several couples might switch their
choice from A to B within the series of pairs see Table A
We used the FP meetings that local health facilities already orga
nized every weekday The participants were informed about when these
meetings took place day and time prior to making their decisions
These meetings consist of two parts In the first part health staff
present information about health related topics including the benefits
of FP and child nutrition In the second part of the meeting the
participants can attend an individual meeting with the nurse where they
are given information about different contraceptive methods and have
To avoid that the decisions might be confounded by potential liquidity
constraints or lack of trust that payments would be made in the future option
A was paid at the same time as option B
Journal of Development Economics
the opportunity to receive free contraceptives These meetings are more
tailored to the individual needs than the first part which only contains
more general information The conditionality imposed in B was only
satisfied if the participants attended the individual meeting
Treatrnents
To test the effect of the husband s involvement on the uptake of FPS
offered at local health facilities we organized three between subject
treatments to which the couples were randomly allocated In these
treatments only the wife only the husband or both spouses together
made the decisions called Wife Decision WD Husband Decision
HD and Joint Decision JD respectively We brought both spouses
to the experiment to ensure that spouses had the same information
about the action set In this manner the only element that differs
across the three between subject treatments is who is involved in the
decision making
To ensure that the participants could freely choose the option
they preferred in the WD and HD treatments we provided plausible
deniability of responsibility for any outcome in these treatments In all
three between subject treatments the participants had a probability
of getting a random outcome i e where their decisions were made
irrelevant In this way it was difficult for the participant s spouse to
infer from the outcome what the participant s decisions were This
procedure was clearly explained to all participants in the first half of
the explanations where all couples were present and before they knew
which treatment they were assigned to The probability was the same
across all treatments but created plausible deniability only in WD and
HD since both spouses observed the decisions made in JD While this
procedure does not entirely remove the pressure to align preferences
with their spouse unless all participants are willing to lie to their
spouse about their decisions we expect it to reduce some of this
pressure
In addition to these between subject treatments we organized four
within subject treatments where we varied the level of payments high
or low and who needed to attend the FP meeting the wife only or
the wife and the husband together We refer to the two latter within
dimensions as Wife FPS and Couple FPS respectively In total
participants made decisions see Table A I in Appendix A The
participants were told that at the end of the experiment we would
randomly select one outcome from their decisions and the plausible
deniability option for implementation
Predictions
To develop predictions on the treatment differences in the likeli
hood that option B is chosen we use the following theoretical model
Consider a household with two decision makers s e w h where w
represents the wife and h represents the husband The household needs
Ashraf
who used a similar procedure to introduce plausible
deniability with a probability of to receive the random outcome
The within variation on who had to attend the FP meeting allows us
to analyze whether the between subject treatment effects depend on this
dimension This is important as coordination costs could be larger where both
spouses need to attend the meeting At the same time having the husband
present at the meeting might be reassuring for the wife because she knows
that her husband approves of her receiving contraceptives On the other
hand it might also give the husband control over the decision to accept
contraceptives at the health facility The variation of the payment level allows
us to test whether there are any income effects More specifically in half of
the decisions we increased the payments in options A and B by TZS
see pairs and in Table A I in Appendix A Adding variation in
payment levels allows us to disentangle an effect of increased cost income
with the Couple FPS from the mere effect of having both spouses attend the
meeting
B D and C Ringdal
to choose x e A B A is the payment they receive without needing
to attend a FP meeting and B is the payment that is conditional on
attending a FP meeting
Spouse s has complete preferences over the two options that can be
represented by a personal utility function us x We allow for the spouses
to have caring preferences and define their ultimate utility function as
Us x
where O We refer to as the caring parameter The
higher ys the more spouse s takes his or her partner s preferences
i e the partner s personal utility function into account in their
ultimate utility function is set to be equal to or lower than
as it is commonly assumed that people do not care more about their
spouse than about themselves on this see e g Browning et al
Costs associated with attending the FP meeting such as transport or
opportunity costs are implicitly taken into account in the personal
utility functions where they reduce us B As these costs are orthogonal
to treatment we do not discuss them further here
We use the collective model as developed by
Chiappori
where the household maximizes a weighted sum of the ultimate
utility functions of both spouses This model formalizes the notion of
bargaining power and shows how a change in bargaining power can
change the household decision outcome Blundell et al The
model thus allows us to predict the effect of including the husband in
the decision making process assuming that doing so would decrease
the wife s bargaining power in the household decision The household
decision can be derived as the solution to
max OUw x l
where O O I is exogenously given and reflects the wife s bargaining
power in the household decision We assume that the less we involve
the husband in the decision the more bargaining power the wife has
More specifically O I in WD O O in HD and O O I in JD Note
that when one of the spouses has all the bargaining power the decision
only depends on his or her ultimate utility function
In the following we focus on the likelihood that B is chosen over A
and how it changes with the wife s bargaining power O If the spouses
have the same preference ordering there are no treatment differences
If however the spouses have different preference orderings an in
crease in the wife s bargaining power will increase the likelihood that
her preferred option is chosen This leads to the following predictions
Prediction If the spouses have the same preferences there are no
treatment effects Thus WD JD HD
Prediction Ifthe spouses have different preferences and the wife prefers
B A and the husband prefers A B the likelihood that B is chosen
weakly decreases increases with a larger involvement of the husband
Thus WD S JD S HD
Implementation
A few weeks before the experiment we conducted a household sur
vey with a sample of couples from hamlets randomly selected
in Misungwi District in Northern Tanzania We interviewed both
In each selected hamlet we selected a random sample of couples
where the wife was below years of age and had at least one living child If
fewer than couples were available in a hamlet we selected all of them We
included both couples who were married and couples who were living together
but were not married in our sample Regardless of their marital status we
use the terms spouses husband and wife when referring to them The
experiment reported in this paper is part of a larger project on reproductive
health in Tanzania The household survey is used in other articles but the
Journal of Development Economics
spouses of each selected couple separately and in private to collect
general socio demographic characteristics and information on fertil
ity preferences contraceptive use and intra household communication
about family planning To conduct the interviews we used same gender
enumerator interviewee pairs We used these survey data to organize
the selection of the couples test whether treatments were balanced
and undertake a heterogeneity analysis of the treatment effects We
excluded all couples where the wife was pregnant when they completed
the survey or where either the husband or the wife reported to be
infecund
Each experimental session was organized in exactly the same way
Couples were convened at a central location e g a classroom or
a community center in the hamlet and the spouses were seated
apart to avoid communication with each other or any other partic
ipant We started each session with some general information about
how the experiment would be conducted no talking no phones in
formed consent anonymity etc Then the couples went through a
non incentivized task to elicit their individual time preferences There
after we provided information about the main task as well as the
content of the FP meetings Couples were then randomly allocated to
one of the three treatments WD JD or HD and called one at a time to
make the decisions in private with an enumerator Here we again used
same gender enumerator interviewee pairs In WD we had one female
enumerator in HD we used one male enumerator and in JD we used
one female and one male enumerator For the detailed experimental
instructions see Appendix D
To test the participants understanding of the instructions the enu
merator asked a set of control questions for decision pairs and
Specifically respondents were asked which option required
them to attend a FP meeting who needed to attend the meeting who
was paid and what would happen at the FP meeting If the participants
answered incorrectly an additional short explanation was given After
having gone through all control questions the enumerator recorded
whether they thought the participant had a sufficient understanding
of the task were thought to have a sufficient understanding
Each spouse received a TZS show up fee approx US
and had the opportunity to earn more during the experiment On
average each couple earned TZS approx US including the
show up fee corresponding to about one week s worth of household
income The show up fee was paid on the day of the experiment while
the remaining payment was paid one month later
After all decisions were made we privately asked participants how
likely they thought it was that they would attend a FP meeting that
their spouse would attend the meeting and that they would ask for con
traceptives at the meeting if option B was selected for payment These
questions were asked of all decision makers wife in WD husband in
HD and both in JD regardless of the decision they had made
At the end of the experiment we randomly selected one outcome
from the decisions and the plausible deniability option for pay
ment If a decision was selected in which B was chosen the wife was
given a form that had to be completed and signed by the nurse at
the closest health center the participants were informed about which
health center they should attend at the beginning of the session We
used this to verify whether the payment condition of option B was
fulfilled see Appendix D for an illustration of the form To ensure
that it was the woman or couple that participated in the experiment
that attended the FP meeting the nurse filled out the name of the
results from the experiment are only reported here As one of the purposes
of the project was to study the use of reproductive health services maternal
health care pre natal and post natal care the women interviewed needed to
have at least one living child
Note that due to the procedure followed to ensure plausible deniability
all respondents face a non zero chance that option B is selected even the
respondents who always chose option A
B D and C Ringdal
woman who attended and the name of her husband if he joined her
When we paid the participant one month after the experimental session
we checked whether the name on the form corresponded with the name
of the participant who was given the form To do this check we used
the second part of the form that was completed and retained by the
nurse
The second part of the form also included some questions on the
uptake of contraceptives which were answered by the nurse In ad
dition when we revisited women to give their payments we asked
them some questions in private about their uptake of contraceptives In
this way we collected data on whether the FP meeting was attended
whether contraceptives were taken up at the meeting reported by
nurses at the health facilities and the participants and if so which type
of contraceptive reported by the nurse
We revisited each hamlet one month after the experimental session
to make the individual payments to the participants For this we used
the following procedure If one of the decision pairs to see Table
A was chosen i e only the wife was paid only the wife was invited
to come and receive the payment If one of the decision pairs to
was chosen i e both spouses were paid both spouses were invited
to come and receive the payment If only one of the spouses showed
up he or she would receive the payments of both spouses Payments
were always made in private With the Couple FPS however spouses
would always receive the same payment and hence could infer each
other s payment
Results
In this section we first describe the sample before presenting the
main treatment effects
The sample
In total we organized experimental sessions in hamlets
health facilities were involved in the study They were located between
min and h driving by motorbike away from the hamlets as
estimated by local hamlet leaders couples were invited to the
experiment of which couples participated show up rate
We do not find any significant differences in observable characteristics
between couples that participated and couples that did not participate
in the experiment see Table A in Appendix A
Table
presents a balance test of important characteristics of the
participants by treatment As can be seen the treatments are well
balanced in terms of observable characteristics Panel A reports socio
demographic characteristics The husbands are generally older and
have more years of education than the wives The couples have on
average three children aged or younger The proportion of Catholics
is higher among the wives while the proportion of respondents without
any religion is higher among the husbands About of women and
of men are employed outside of the household and of women
and of men are self employed Nearly of women and of
men had been growing agricultural crops in the last season The most
common crops were maize followed by sweet potatoes cassava and
rice More than of the households own cattle or pack animals or
smaller animals such as sheep goats and rabbits Most respondents
belong to the Sukuma tribe more than
With couples we interviewed both spouses while with couples
we only interviewed the wife and with couples we only interviewed the
husband The participants who did not take part in the household survey were
asked for some basic information after the experimental session including age
education and religion In total women and men were interviewed in
this way
Journal of Development Economics
Panel B reports statistics on fertility preferences About of men
and of women do not want to have any more children Among
the respondents who want to have more children most of them want to
wait at least two years before having another child Thus the need for
family planning is high On average men and women want to have
six children with a median of for women and for men
We find considerable within couple differences in fertility prefer
ences In of the couples one of the spouses does not want more
children while the other either wants more children or is undecided in
of the couples the husband does not want more children while
the wife wants more or is undecided and in of the couples the
wife does not want more children while the husband wants more or is
undecided Furthermore of the couples where both spouses want more
children disagree about when to have the next child are
couples where the husband wants to delay the next child by at least
years and the wife does not and are couples where the wife
wants to delay the next child by at least years and the husband does
not
Panel C displays current use of contraceptives see Table A in
Appendix A for past and intended use of contraceptives We present
information on the use of modern contraceptives and the use of long
acting reversible contraceptives LARC II of the wives report
using modern contraceptives and use LARC This is percent
age points higher than the percentage of couples where the husband
reported that they used modern contraceptives In other words in only
of the couples where the wife reports using modern contracep
tives the husband also reports using modern contraceptives Among
these couples of the women report that the husband does not
know that they are using contraceptives Thus intentional hiding of
contraceptive use does not seem to drive all the reporting differences
between men and women
Of the women who are not currently using contraceptives used
modern contraceptives used LARC in the past and believe
that they will use contraceptives in the future plan to use
LARC and to sterilize Interestingly while fewer men plan to use
contraceptives in the future more men than women plan to
do a sterilization For more details see Table A in Appendix
Panel D presents statistics on within couple communication about
FP and beliefs about the spouse s opinion on contraceptives In
of the couples both spouses reported that they discussed FP with each
other of the women and of the men believe that their
spouse approves of contraceptives while of the women and
of the men believe that their spouse disapproves
This is in line with the recent Demographic and Health survey
In
the Lake region both urban and rural pooled to which our study region
belongs of currently married women aged and of all
currently married men do not want any more children
We define someone to have a need for family planning if the respondent
does not want any more children or wants to wait at least two years before
having more children
The participants are asked whether they themselves or their spouse are
doing something or using any method to delay or avoid getting pregnant We
define modern contraceptives as contraceptives that give women a reliable
means to control their fertility These methods include the pill injectables
intrauterine devices IUD implants and sterilization We do not include male
condoms as women are often unable to enforce their use If we had included
condoms in modern contraceptives of women would report using modern
contraceptives LARCs include IUDs and implants We allowed couples who
already used modern contraceptives to participate in the experiment because
it might still be interesting for them to attend the FP meeting For example a
couple might want to obtain better information about contraceptives or simply
receive an updated checkup by the nurse or a woman who uses contraceptives
without her husband being aware might want to convince him that using
contraceptives is a good thing to do

and IUDs Employed takes the value if the respondent reports having worked for someone else in the past months including on someone else s farm business or for an
organization or company such as school government and bank Self employed takes the value if the respondent reports running a business other than farming such as a
shop fishing driver and builder The total number of observations is Some variables include only a sub sample Want to wait to years or more includes participants that
want more children The last column presents the two sided p value of an ANOVA The joint statistics is from a multinomial regression using the Treatment as the dependent

Panel C in Table A in Appendix A shows that of the women
and of the men reported ever discussing FP with a nurse at a
health center Of these of the women and of the men
had the discussion in the past year and most are either completely or
somewhat satisfied with the services they received Even if a substantial
proportion of women discussed FP at the health center many of them
in the past year only of them are using modern contraceptives
and the unmet need for FP remains high One of the most commonly
cited reasons for not using contraceptives is fear of side effects
Moreover there is a lack of knowledge about FP among both men and
women As an example of women and of men do not know
whether injectables are effective in avoiding pregnancy and nearly
of both men and women believe that the pill causes infertility
for more details see Table A in Appendix A This suggests that
neither women nor men have sufficient knowledge about FP and are
in need of more information before they would start or continue using
contraceptives
Main treatment effects
To investigate the effect of the husband s involvement on the
likelihood that FPS are chosen we estimate the following regression
where yc is the proportion of the decisions where couple c chose
FPS henceforth referred to as proportion a is a constant and JD c
and HD c are treatment indicator variables taking the value if
couple c was assigned to JD and HD respectively WD is used as the
base treatment ps captures session fixed effects Xc is a set of control
variables and E c is the error term
reports the results In column we include only the
Table
treatment indicator variables In columns we sequentially add
This specification focuses on the between subject treatments For the
influence of within subject treatments see the demand curves presented in

We find that involving the husband significantly increases the pro
portion of the decisions where FPS are chosen and that this effect is
robust across the different specifications The proportion is
percentage points higher in HD than in WD and is percentage
points higher in JD than in WD There is no difference in the proportion
between the two treatments where the husband is involved
To test the robustness of these results we undertake the following
additional analyses First the results are robust across the different
within subject treatments as shown in Table A in Appendix A
Second they are also robust to only including couples with a sufficient
understanding of the task and who do not switch more than once
see Table A in Appendix A It even increases the point estimates
and the statistical significance of the effects Third even though the
estimates are very similar when we add controls it should be noted that
adding controls reduces the sample by from to couples
One might therefore wonder whether removing the couples for which
we do not have background information influences the estimates To
obtain an idea of whether that might be the case we remove the
controls from the regression in column in Table The results are
presented in column of Table A in Appendix A and are again
very similar Fourth of the couples in our sample are polygamous
Distance to the nearest health center might matter as they determine
travel costs The session fixed effects we include in the regressions control
for distance to the health center because all participants in a session were
recruited from the same hamlet
A comparison of the within subject treatments see Table A in Appendix
A shows that i in the high payment condition the effect of the husband s
involvement is stronger when both spouses need to attend the FP meeting
and ii in the condition where only the wife needs to attend the FP meeting
Wife FPS the effect of the husband s involvement is weaker in the high
payment condition
of the couples switched more than once in a price list and
of the couples had a sufficient understanding As can be seen in Table A in
Appendix A there are no differences in understanding and multiple switching
across treatments

evenly distributed across treatments p from F test see Table
A in Appendix A As polygamous and monogamous couples might
behave differently it is important to test whether the results are influ
enced by the inclusion of polygamous couples Column in Table A
in Appendix A shows the regression results with monogamous couples
only The results are again robust Finally we add experimenter fixed
effects in Table A in Appendix A As different enumerators were used
in the WD and HD treatments only female enumerators were involved
in WD and only male enumerators were involved in HD we cannot
control for experimenter effects for the comparison between WD and
HD However as all enumerators were involved in JD we can control
for experimenter effects for the pairwise comparisons between JD and
each of the other treatments As can be seen from Table A in Appendix
A the results remain robust
Mechanisms
So far we found that involving the husband increases the likelihood
that FPS are chosen This result indicates that Uh A
Uw A In this section we explore potential mechanisms
that might explain why women and men evaluate options A and
B differently More specifically the positive effect of involving the
husband can be driven by one of the following mechanisms
The husband gets more personal utility from FPS than his wife
The wife incorrectly believes that her husband disapproves of
contraceptives
The wife expects that the plan to use FPS is less likely to be
fulfilled when the husband is not involved
In the rest of this section we will look for supporting evidence on
each of the three mechanisms We will also develop our theoretical
model to incorporate the role of beliefs about spousal preferences
second mechanism and uncertainty about whether the FP meeting
will be attended third mechanism
Does the husband have a stronger preference for FPS
Involving the husband in the decision could increase the likelihood
that FPS are chosen if the husband gets more personal utility from FPS
than his wife Recall that the ultimate utility function is defined as
Us l Thus involving the husband increases the
likelihood that B is chosen if uh B uw B
To find evidence for this mechanism we look into three possible
sources of spousal differences in FPS preferences i fertility prefer
ences awareness of contraceptive use and unmet need for FP ii
knowledge about FP and iii hyperbolic time preferences We explore
each of them in turn
Fertility preferences awareness of contraceptive use and unmet FP
need
It is plausible that if an individual has a need for family planning
i e does not want more children or wants to delay having more
children this individual is more likely to prefer FPS In our sample
we observe important differences in fertility preferences between men
and women As reported in
more women than men do not want
Table
more children There are also important within couple differences In
of the couples in our sample one of the spouses in this is
the husband does not want more children while the other does or is
undecided In couples where both spouses want more children there
is also important heterogeneity in how long they want to wait with
getting the next child
Some of the analyses in this section were not pre specified in our pre
analysis plan The idea of inaccurate beliefs is discussed in Appendix A I of
the pre analysis plan
