Principal findings
In this prospective birth cohort study
the offspring of mothers with GDM had
higher cord blood C peptide levels
which were further increased in the pres
ence of AD Maternal glucose metabo

and the association became stronger
with increasing AD severity In addition
AD was associated with higher cord
blood C peptide levels in pregnant par
ticipants with GDM However no signif
icant association was observed among
participants without GDM This study
reported the function of maternal mental
health factors in the intergenerational
transmission of metabolic disorders
Results and clinical and research
implications
Mounting evidence suggests that GDM
predisposes the offspring to metabolic
disorders in later life independent
of maternal obesity or genetic
background
Previous studies dem
onstrated a continuous association
between maternal glucose levels and the
risk of higher cord PG levels and fetal
hyperinsulinemia clinical diagnosis of
cord blood C peptide level of
percentile
The
International
Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy
Outcome study demonstrated that cord
blood C peptide level was negatively
associated with childhood insulin sensi
tivity and positively associated with an
increased risk of newborn adiposity
Our results are in line with previous
findings of GDM which showed a
consistently positive
relationship
between I hour PG and hour PG and
cord blood C peptide level Although
the relationship between GDM and
cord blood C peptide was demonstrated
previously differences in this associa
tion between populations have not been
reported Here we performed a stratifi
cation analysis and found that the posi
tive association of cord blood C peptide
and GDM seems stronger in partici

association between GDM and high
cord blood C peptide levels however
the underlying mechanism remains
unknown The adverse intrauterine
environment during human pregnancy
strongly affects the fetoplacental vascu
lar morphology The available evi
dence suggests that maternal glucose is
passively transferred from the mother
to the fetus across the placenta
Hyperglycemia may stimulate placental
cells which buffer excess maternal glu
cose or increase vascular resistance
leading to changes in various key mole
cules including gene expression
inflammatory cytokines and placental
endothelial dysfunction
This could
result in more maternal glucose enter
ing the fetal circulation which causes
cell hyperplasia in the fetus and over
stimulates the release of insulin from
the fetal pancreas
Multiple studies have revealed an
association between depression and
increased HPA axis activation
It is
possible that after heightened maternal
stress the maternal fetal interface can
be disrupted by placental immune sen
sitization which affects fetal HPA axis
development Nevertheless disruption
of the HPA axis may contribute to pla

epigenetic status or expression of genes
encoding the II hydroxysteroid dehy
drogenase type enzyme in the pla
centa which can compromise placental
barrier function We speculate that
AD aggravates the injury to the placen
tal endothelium and exacerbates the
intergenerational transmission of meta
bolic disorders In addition elevations
in maternal glucose levels may be asso
ciated with maternal catecholamine ele
vations with associated maternal mood
dysfunction This further explains the
increased cord blood C peptide levels in
pregnant participants with GDM with
AD
In addition positive associations
were observed between AD and cord
blood C peptide levels However previ
ous studies revealed inconsistent con
clusions regarding the relationship
between depression and C peptide lev
els in nonpregnant populations How
ever few studies have focused on the
association between AD and cord blood
C peptide levels The current study may
provide evidence of the effect of mater
nal emotional problems on health in
early life Interestingly after analyses
stratified for GDM we observed a posi
tive association between fetal hyperin
sulinemia and AD in pregnant
participants with GDM whereas no
association was observed in pregnant
participants without GDM despite the
adjustment for potential confounders
Our study extended previous work by
investigating the combined effects of
GDM and AD on fetal hyperinsuline
mia revealing that GDM comorbid
depression may be double hits to the
developing fetal cell function A
potential explanation for our results
might be that in maternal hyperglyce
mia which always causes placental
endothelial dysfunction molecular sub
strates mediated by depression pass
through the placenta more easily which
can affect the fetal islets However fur
ther research is required to understand
this transport process
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths First it
was based on a birth cohort with a rela
tively large population and rich
questionnaire data used to assess poten
tial confounding factors Second this
was the first study to reveal the role of
psychological factors during pregnancy
in the intergenerational transmission of
metabolic disorders In particular we
analyzed AD in midpregnancy and late
pregnancy simultaneously rather than
at a single point in time Finally sensi
tivity analyses were performed using
subgroup analyses to increase the reli
ability of our interpretations Fourth in
addition to conducting subgroup and
sensitivity analyses to further evaluate
the association we performed a dose
response analysis to fully understand
this relationship
This study has several limitations
First it did not obtain a clinical diagno
sis of AD thus outcome misclassifica
tion was possible However a validated
screening scale which has been used in
multiple studies in China was used for
the diagnosis
Second we cannot
account for the contributions of unmea
sured factors to emotional changes in
depression over time such as stress and
anxiety that are caused by work or
changing attitudes toward pregnancy
outcomes Third although we have
excluded pregnant participants with
abnormal blood glucose control we are
still unable to obtain dynamic blood
glucose readings for further compari
son Therefore we cannot rule out the
effect of differences in blood glucose
control This limitation could poten
tially affect the ability to evaluate the
effect of GDM on fetal hyperinsulinism
under different blood glucose fluctua
tion conditions Fourth because the
study design was observational no
causal inference could be drawn and
only associations could be described
Finally some residual confounding fac
tors may exist despite the adjustment
for the most important ones
Conclusions
AD enhanced the association between
GDM and cord blood C peptide levels
and increased the risk of hyperinsuline
mia in the offspring of mothers with
GDM These results expand our under
standing of the role of psychological
factors during pregnancy in the
Original Research
intergenerational transmission of meta
bolic disorders Psychological factors
during pregnancy may be potentially
important targets in the early stages of
life for interventions to prevent glucose

Further clinical research and prospec
tive birth cohort studies are needed to
validate these findings

BACKGROUND In nonpregnant populations sodium intake has been
associated with the development of chronic hypertension and sodium
restriction has been identified as a strategy to reduce blood pressure
Data regarding the relationship between sodium intake and the develop
ment of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are limited and conflicting
OBJECTIVE This study aimed to assess the association between daily
periconceptional sodium intake and the risk of hypalensive disorders of
pregnancy
STUDY DESIGN This was a secondary analysis of the prospective Nullip
arous Pregnancy Outcomes Study Monitoring Mothers To Be study Individu
als with nonanomalous singleton pregnancies who completed food frequency
questionnaires with recorded sodium intake in the months before pregnancy
were included in the analysis Individuals whose pregnancies did not progress
beyond weeks of gestation were excluded from the analysis Sodium
intake was categorized as low g per day medium to g per day
or high g per day based on thresholds used in the nonpregnant popula
tion The primary outcome was the development of a new onset hypertensive
disorder of pregnancy including gestational hypettension preeclampsia
hemolysis elevated liver enzymes and low platelet count syndrome superim
posed preeclampsia or eclampsia Bivariable analyses were performed using
Kruskal Wallis and chi square tests Poisson regression was used to estimate
adjusted incidence risk ratios with confidence intervals after controlling
for potentially confounding factors
RESULTS Among individuals included in this analysis
reported low sodium intake repotted medium sodium
intake and reported high sodium intake Individuals with high
sodium intake were more likely to have chronic hypertension to use
tobacco and to be living with obesity The risk of developing a hyperten
Sive disorder of pregnancy was similar among groups medium vs low
adjusted incidence risk ratio confidence interval
high vs low adjusted incidence risk ratio confidence interval
There was no difference in neonatal outcomes by sodium
intake including preterm birth small for gestational age neonate and
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit
CONCLUSION Sodium intake was not associated with the risk of
developing a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy This lack of association
contrasts with that between sodium intake and hypertension in the non
pregnant state and may reflect differences in the pathophysiology underly
ing pregnancy vs non pregnancy related hypertensive disorders
Key words diet gestational hypalension hypertensive disorders of

interventions to prevent and treat these
disorders remain limited
Outside of pregnancy there is consid
erable evidence to support the relation
ship between sodium intake and both the
development and control of chronic
hypertension A meta analysis of
cohort studies published in identi
fied a linear relationship between sodium
intake and the risk of hypertension with
an excess risk of hypertension noted with
an intake of g of sodium per day
An earlier systematic review and meta
analysis of trials including partic
ipants found that a modest reduction in
sodium intake for weeks was associ
ated with significant decreases in blood
pressure among both individuals with
hypertension and individuals with normal
blood pressure
Data regarding the relationship
between sodium intake and HDPs
have been less conclusive For example
although increased salinity of drinking
water has been associated with an
increased risk of developing HDPs
sodium restriction during pregnancy
has not been shown to decrease the
frequency of HDPs There are few
data available regarding the relationship
between periconceptional sodium intake
and the development of HDPs Given
the importance of preventing the devel
opment of HDPs this study aimed to
investigate the relationship between
periconceptional sodium intake and the
development of HDP with the goal of
better understanding sodium intake as a
potentially modifiable risk factor

Why was this study conducted
This study aimed to investigate the association between periconceptional sodium
intake and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy HDPs
Key findings
Periconceptional sodium intake was not associated with the development of
HDPs
What does this add to what is known
Study findings indicate that the assessment of periconceptional sodium intake
should not inform counseling regarding the risk of HDPs and that decreasing
sodium intake is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing the risk of
hypertensive disorder

Discussion
Principal findings
In this secondary analysis of a large pro
spective cohort study in the United
States which included the collection of
detailed periconceptional dietary data
via a validated questionnaire we found
that self reported periconceptional
sodium intake categorized based on
commonly recommended guidelines
was not associated with a risk of the
development of HDPs In addition the
risk of adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes did not differ with the
reported amount of sodium intake
Results
There is evidence to support a low salt
diet as an intervention to reduce hyper
tension in nonpregnant populations
In addition sodium restriction has been
used historically to treat preeclampsia

al used the FFQ data from the
cohort to analyze the rela
tionship between different dietary
compositions and adverse pregnancy
outcomes Although they analyzed
sodium intake as one of their dietary
exposures it was assessed differently
than in our analysis Specifically it was
evaluated in the context of dietary den
sity standard unit per kilocalo
ries and scored as one of the
components of the Healthy Eating
Index In addition Petersen s
work focused on preeclampsia specifi
cally In contrast we analyzed sodium
intake by daily quantity and analyzed
the association with all new onset
HDPs Our data expand this extant
body of literature suggesting that there
is also no association between pericon
ceptional sodium intake and the devel
opment of HDPs Of note there was an
association between sodium intake and
HDPs before the adjustment for con
founding variables it is possible that
individuals have concomitant dietary
habits such as high sugar and high salt
intake that alter their risk of multiple
comorbidities
Our findings contrast with those of
Khan et al who conducted a case con
trol study of women with pre
eclampsia or gestational hypertension
and matched controls and who
identified an association between salin
ity of drinking water and risk of

An explainable machine
learning based clinical decision
support system for prediction
of gestational diabetes mellitus
Yuhan Dul Anthony R Fionnuala M Lan Weil Catherine Mooney
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM a common pregnancy complication associated with many
maternal and neonatal consequences is increased in mothers with overweight and obesity
Interventions initiated early in pregnancy can reduce the rate of GDM in these women however
untargeted interventions can be costly and time consuming We have developed an explainable
machine learning based clinical decision support system CDSS to identify at risk women in need
of targeted pregnancy intervention Maternal characteristics and blood biomarkers at baseline from
the PEARS study were used After appropriate data preparation synthetic minority oversampling
technique and feature selection five machine learning algorithms were applied with five fold cross
validated grid search optimising the balanced accuracy Our models were explained with Shapley
additive explanations to increase the trustworthiness and acceptability of the system We developed
multiple models for different use cases theoretical AUC PR AUC ROC GDM screening
during a normal antenatal visit AUC PR AUC ROC and remote GDM risk assessment
AUC PR AUC ROC Our models have been implemented as a web server that is publicly
available for academic Use Our explainable CDSS demonstrates the potential to assist clinicians in
screening at risk patients who may benefit from early pregnancy GDM prevention strategies
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus GDM is generally defined as glucose intolerance of varying degrees of severity
with onset or first recognition during pregnancy l The risk of GDM is increased with overweight and
of which the global prevalence has increased substantially in the past GDM increases the risk of many
maternal and neonatal complications such as gestational hypertension polyhydramnios Caesarean birth prema
ture delivery large for gestational age and neonatal macrosomia intensive care unit admission hypoglycaemia
and respiratory Moreover GDM may predispose to long term sequelae for both mother and child
including metabolic syndrome and type diabetes thus increasing later life chronic disease
Research shows that interventions initiated early in pregnancy can reduce the rate of GDM in pregnant
women with overweight and However applying interventions in every instance can be costly and time
consuming A clinical decision support system CDSS based on machine learning can be helpful in providing
a powerful and objective computerised tool to assist clinicians identify women at risk of GDM It would largely
reduce the time and cost by allowing targeted intervention The CDSS has great potential in clinical settings
especially under the circumstance that many clinicians have turned to telemedicine to maintain social distancing
during the COVID
CDSSs have a great potential to improve healthcare delivery though literature on their successful adoption
especially that of machine learning based CDSSs is scarce Shortliffe and indicated that aside from
system accuracy effciency and usability are important for a CDSS to be accepted and integrated into clinical
workflow A CDSS should be time saving intuitive and simple to use in order to obtain system outputs easily
while juggling a heavy clinical workload They also pointed out that black boxes are not acceptable for CDSSs
This is inline with Antoniadi et al ll who indicated that explainability is a critical component for a CDSS to be
adopted in practical use effectively A famous example by Caruana et al shows that a machine learning based
system can reflect the pattern in the training data but be inconsistent with medical knowledge and thus does not
translate to clinical practice Their system predicted that patients who had a history of asthma had a lower risk

Table Previously published machine learning based GDM risk prediction models Where multiple models
were developed the best performing model is described
of dying from pneumonia than the general population This is because patients who had asthma and presented
with pneumonia usually receive aggressive care which lowers their risk Even though the system truly captured
the training data it would be problematic if adopted in clinical practice without understanding why the model
behaved this way Such problems can be resolved using Explainable Artificial Intelligence XAI Many benefits
have been reported in the use of XAI in CDSS including enhancing decision confidence generating the hypoth
esis about causality and increasing acceptability and trustworthiness of the system Nevertheless there is an
overall distinct lack of the application of XAI in CDSSs in the published literaturell
We aim to apply machine learning to develop a CDSS that predicts the risk of GDM in a high risk group
of women with overweight and obesity to identify those who may benefit from prevention strategies early in
pregnancy We performed modeling on baseline maternal characteristics and blood biomarkers collected in the
Pregnancy Exercise and Nutrition with smart phone application support PEARS study Multiple probabilistic
prediction models incorporating different feature subsets were developed for different use cases including theo
retical routine antenatal and remote risk assessment Intelligent optimization algorithms were not considered in
this work Clinical usability was taken into account throughout the modeling process Moreover we applied
Shapley additive explanations SHAP a game theoretic XAI method to explain the models and thus make them
more acceptable and trustworthy for clinicians The models were implemented as a web server based CDSS that
is open for academic use Our CDSS has a potential to help clinicians identify women at risk of GDM in early
pregnancy
The rest of the paper is organised as follows Section Related work reviewed previous research done in the
related field The data modeling process and explanation method used in this research are introduced in Sec
tion Methods Section Results describes our final models and their performance on white and non white
populations as well as the implementation of a CDSS prototype and a case study The discussion of our findings
are presented in Section Discussion Section Conclusion concludes this paper
Related work
We comprehensively reviewed original research articles published between Jan and Dec on the use
of machine learning to predict the risk of GDM The search was performed on PubMed Science Direct Scopus
IEEE and ACM The search terms are machine learning gestational diabetes mellitus and risk prediction
A total of nine papers were deemed relevant and summarized in Table
Given the prevalence of GDM there are usually many more non GDM cases than GDM cases leading to
unbalanced datasets Some of the studies have not successfully addressed this class imbalance problem which may
lead to the development of models that perform well for the majority class non GDM only i e high specificity
but low sensitivity In addition most models have not been designed for use in a clinical setting All models
focused on GDM prediction in general pregnant women whereas prediction in a high risk group would allow
for more cost effective GDM screening which would be more suitable for clinical use Only Artzi et al and
Wu et al considered the impact of the number or accessibility of features included on the clinical usability of
the models in the modeling process Additionally Artzi et al is the only group of researchers who included
the explainability in the model design However they did not provide justification of why their model made a
specific prediction for an instance local interpretation Moreover due to the geographic area where maternal
data were collected all models are trained on data from women who are predominantly from the same ethnic
group There is a lack of studies that investigate the differences that might be associated with different cultural
or ethnic backgrounds in GDM prediction Additionally there is a lack of implementation of the models into
an open access web server or application which allows for benchmarking or validation There is a randomised
controlled trial designed to screen for high risk women using the model by Wu et al and assess the effect of
an individualised nutritional intervention to prevent GDM in this but the model is not publicly
available for academic use
