found ways to support youth s
genuine preferences This is consistent with research underscoring that
even in a mandatory child welfare environment adults can create op
portunities for youth participation and choice and for youth to share
their ideas without fear of manipulation and pressure Caffrey

Limitations
The power imbalance that youth in foster care experience in the child
welfare system can limit researchers in their ability to fully represent
their voices Incorporating voice through interviews for example does
not automatically empower youth rather systemic issues such as
power differences can shape what youth in foster care say and their
ability to express themselves
McGregor et al Nybell and
affect the research process
Despite the evaluation
Spyrou
team s efforts to establish rapport with youth it is likely that some youth
withheld information or selectively shared what they thought might be
more socially desirable during interviews Moreover a youth s famil
iarity with the interviewer could have influenced what youth shared
although it is challenging to know how it affected any given youth For
example having an interviewer observe their family planning meeting
could have helped build rapport with one youth and it could have
contributed to another youth feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable
during their interview As another example six youth had follow up
interviews and two interviews involved sibling pairs Either of these
situations could have contributed positively or negatively to what
youth felt comfortable talking about during their interview Other fac
tors that could have influenced what a youth shared during their
interview include individual differences between youth e g age
gender culture family composition and the extent of their experience
in the child welfare system
Interviewees were unevenly distributed across the three child wel
fare jurisdictions implementing LIFE Participating youth were years
old and older English speaking and predominantly white living in rural
areas As such our data may not be indicative of youth experiences
particularly Black Indigenous and other Youth of Color and child
welfare practices in other settings Although the evaluation team
worked hard to recruit youth with varying levels of engagement in LIFE
services those who were most disengaged or never participated in
family meetings perhaps due to having more negative experiences with
child welfare are not represented Therefore these findings likely lack
nuance about working to engage youth in instances when there is a need
to repair relationships or if the youth experienced harm resulting from
child welfare agency decisions e g

Using a motivational framework in the context of child welfare
practice
Understanding how to constructively promote engagement is foun
dational for casework SDT explains that youth engagement reflects the
extent of an individual s needs fulfillment and offers various pathways
to facilitate engagement As such the results of this study have impli
cations for child welfare practice as it pertains to youth engagement
Knowing the importance of a youth s subjective experience one key
implication for practice is that caseworkers need to spend time devel
oping relationships with youth to learn about their needs and ways in
which they can strive to meet them e g
It also

suggests the importance of routinely asking youth for feedback to better
understand whether their needs are being met

Crowe
tizing relationships in the child welfare system might also require
creating accountability structures for caseworkers e g required face
to face contact and shifts in resource allocations e g lower case
loads reduced administrative burden to allow caseworkers to spend
time doing this type of work Gibson Samuels Pryce
A second key implication for practice is the need for caseworkers to
shift their thinking away from a compliance orientation toward a needs
based approach to understanding youth engagement SDT explains
that a youth whose basic needs are not being met might respond to their
caseworker by refusing to participate in family meetings with ambiv
alence or by avoiding them A caseworker with a compliance orienta
tion might interpret these types of disaffected behaviors as
noncompliance or opposition rather than as a signal of unmet needs
requiring additional support This dynamic is similar to the assertion
that caseworkers who lack trauma informed training might fail to
recognize youth s emotional and behavioral problems as trauma
symptoms e g Conners Burrow et al
A third key implication for practice pertains to the need for case
workers to both value and practice redistributing power with youth as
they navigate the child welfare system Previous research has high
lighted that when youth are empowered i e autonomy is supported to
participate in processes intended to protect them their participation can
promote their well being Vis et al van Bijleveld et al As
we previously noted youth involved in the child welfare system often
experience additional trauma lack of access to needed supports and
services and challenges to their basic right to participate in their fam
ily s case planning Caseworkers who lack the time practice experience
and skills to work with youth may unintentionally reinforce power dy
namics that exist in the child welfare system
Kosher Ben Arieh
et al
On the other hand caseworkers who understand
how to create conditions for youth to authentically engage in protective
processes such as family case planning meetings can also contribute to
youth well being
A final implication is the need for the child welfare system to
support caseworkers as they strive to do youth centered casework For
example high caseloads and the focus on procedural tasks and paper
work can be significant sources of burnout for caseworkers and get in the
way of the relational work that is necessary to promote engagement e
Leake Rienks Obermann Ferguson Seim
Systemic issues such as caseworker turnover and an organiza
tional culture that does not prioritize youth voice are also barriers to
youth engagement work Child Welfare Information Gateway

in their work e g

Conclusion
The child welfare system struggles to promote authentic youth
engagement Trauma lack of power and other disadvantages experi
enced by youth in foster care profoundly constrain their ability to
Children and Youth Services Review
identify and express their needs and wants SDT suggests that engage
ment reflects needs fulfillment and therefore it is crucial that individual
youth s needs are understood Of central importance for youth
engagement was the LIFE team s ability to recognize and authentically
respond to youth and to hold space which requires time relationship
building and redistributing power for youth with very little control
over their lives to discover and articulate what they need Creating
conditions that encourage youth engagement in their family s case
planning meetings requires caseworkers to practice in ways that coun
teract the power imbalance that youth face as well as a commitment to
centering youth experiences and contributing to their overall well being
and development It also requires a child welfare system that creates
supportive conditions for its workforce

Abstract
Background Computerized clinical decision support CDSS digital information systems designed to improve
clinical decision making by providers is a promising tool for improving quality of care This study aims to
understand the uptake of ASMAN application defined as completeness of electronic case sheets the role of CDSS
in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery outcomes
Methods We have conducted secondary analysis of program data government data collected from public
facilities across four districts each in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan The data collected between
August October baseline and the data collected between December March latest was
analysed The data sources included digitized labour room registers case sheets referral and discharge summary
forms observation checklist and complication format Descriptive univariate and multivariate and interrupted time
series regression analyses were conducted
Results The completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period and in facilities with
more than deliveries a month In multivariate logistic regression analysis the introduction of technology
yielded significant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices We have observed reduction in fresh still
births rates and asphyxia but these results were not statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
However our analysis showed that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of
program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased
Conclusions Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care and delivery
outcome Future studies with rigorous study design is required to understand the impact of technology in
improving quality of maternity care

Introduction
Globally it has been proven that effective and quality of
care at the facility level particularly around childbirth
and immediately after the birth can significantly con
tribute to the reduction of maternal deaths stillbirths
and neonatal deaths Over the last decades efforts
in ensuring skilled birth attendance resulted in increased
institutional deliveries this in turn moved higher pro
portion of avoidable maternal and neonatal mortality to
health facilities Therefore improving quality of care
around childbirth and immediately after birth is impera
tive to prevent adverse outcomes for pregnant women
and new borns
In India despite a tremendous increase in rate of insti
tutional deliveries maternal and neonatal deaths did
not show equivalent reduction in the last decade It
was found by few studies that the increase in the rate of
institutional deliveries was not matched with overall im
provement in quality of maternity care Quality of
care is a multi dimensional concept that incudes avail
ability of evidence based guidelines strengthened infra
structure resources enabling environment attitude of
health providers all these in turn result in patients and
providers satisfaction and improved health outcomes
To address these issues the Government of India
GOI launched the quality improvement initiative under
the name Dakshata means adroitness to build pro
vider adherence to key evidence based clinical practices
during intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods
Dakshata uses the World Health Organization s Safe
Childbirth Checklist SCC as a framework for
improving providers competency Although Dakshata
intervention has not been evaluated other quality of
intrapartum care improvement initiatives using SCC in
Rajasthan Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka
demonstrated significant improvement in adherence to
evidence based clinical practices Moreover a study from
Rajasthan showed reduction in perinatal mortality
which fell by However these studies detected
certain clinical practices that either did not improve sig
nificantly initiation of partograph counselling on dan
ger signs or declined over months period use of
SCC administration of oxytocin soon after delivery
Thus it is imperative to identify and test innovative so
lutions for improving quality of care in order to acceler
ate reduction in maternal and neonatal death in India
One such solution is computerized clinical decision sup
port CDSS digital information systems designed to
improve clinical decision making by providers a prom
ising tool for improving quality of care by improving ad
herence to clinical guidelines practitioner s
performance patient outcomes and
quality of clinical documentation thus contributing
to quality improvement and overall efficiency of health
Page of
care delivery While there is significant research on
CDSSs generally but evidence of use of CDSS for mater
nity care is limited In rural health facilities in Burkina
Faso Ghana and Tanzania CDSS was not found to sig
nificantly improve quality of antenatal and delivery care
A study conducted in South Africa showed that
CDSS lead to overall improvement in adherence to clin
ical guidelines but it was not statistically significant
In Nigeria McNabb et al reported that decision support
via mobile phones led to significant improvement in
health counselling technical services quality of health
education and patient satisfaction
ASMAN intervention
In this paper we describe the findings from implementa
tion of ASMAN The Alliance for Saving Mothers and
Newborns a provider focused package of interventions
that leverages technology to reduce maternal and early
neonatal mortality through the adoption of key tech
nologies that improve capacity building and service de
livery efforts focused on the provision of quality care
during childbirth and the first h after delivery
The ASMAN project takes an integrated quality im
provement approach
Competency building through provision of
training for Medical Officers MOs Staff Nurses
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife ANM on clinical skills
and quality of care as per the established labour
room protocols and standards For this purpose the
project adopted GOI approved Dakshata training
package for building the capacity of service
providers Post training follow up and on site men
toring were conducted by the program team to en
sure translation of skills into practice
Introduction of technology intervention to facilitate
timely and correct clinical decision making by pro
viders For this purpose ASMAN an android based
application for electronic recording of intrapartum
and immediate postpartum care integrated with
Clinical Decision Support e partograph knowledge
enhancement and other features was introduced at
project sites The ASMAN application runs on a
tablet stationed in several important areas of the
health facilities including registration triage the
labor room postpartum areas operation theatre
and post operative wards
The ASMAN application had the following
components
Case management Digitized case sheet from
admission until discharge with integrated clinical
rules admission notes e partogram Safe Childbirth

ASMAN Complication Management Game a case
based game designed to improve management of
intrapartum and immediate postpartum postnatal
complications for developing critical thinking skills

clinical guidelines on Basic Emergency Obstetric and
Neonatal Care
Remote support center staffed by senior

ASMAN program implementation took place across
public facilities in four districts each in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh states of India The key stakeholders of
ASMAN were Governments of Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan This project was piloted between June
to May with support from Reliance Foundation
Tata Trusts MSD for Mothers Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and United States Agency for International
Development USAID Jhpiego was the lead implemen
tation agency The respective state governments were
consulted to select specific intervention districts that
had higher neonatal and maternal mortality rates as
compared to the state average districts without ongoing
intervention for improving quality of intrapartum and
postpartum care Within those districts government
health facilities that had a relatively high case load of
or more deliveries per month and therefore greater need
for intervention were selected
This program implementation offered an opportunity
to evaluate the role of a CDSS in improving quality of
care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum
periods assess its impact on delivery outcomes identifi
cation and referral of key maternal and neonatal compli
cations in selected public facilities
Methodology
Research aims
To our knowledge no studies from India have described
the impact of CDSS on clinical outcomes during the
intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods Along
with the lack of evidence on effect of CDSS in improving
quality of maternity care this gap represents a crucial
Page of
research priority for India with global relevance
Through this analysis we attempt to answer the follow
ing questions
What was the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers
How did the ASMAN application affect adherence
to key clinical practices
What was the trend of maternal pre eclampsia
eclampsia postpartum haemorrhage and neonatal
fresh still births birth asphyxia complications
during the project implementation
What was the trend of identification and referral of
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
postpartum haemorrhage during the project
implementation
Study design and study setting
We have conducted secondary analysis of program data
government data collected from public facilities
across four districts each in two states of Madhya
Pradesh Jabalpur Khargone Ratlam and Vidisha and
Rajasthan Ajmer Bhilwara Kota and Jhalawar This
de identified dataset was provided by the government of
both states The data collected between August Octo
ber was considered as a baseline and the data
collected between December March was
considered as a latest assessment The study was per
formed in accordance with ethical principles outlined in
the World Medical Association W MA Declaration of
Helsinki where privacy and confidentiality of per
sonal information was assured by getting access to de
identified data
Study tools and data collection
The following tools were used to collect data
ASMAN application data has digitized all labour
room registers case sheets referral and discharge
summary forms of Government of India Every
woman who comes to any ASMAN facility for
delivery is registered in the application All forms
are filled by the health providers at the project
facilities in real time Details from patient history
labour room case sheets partograph until
discharge is collected in the ASMAN application
We have used data from ASMAN application to
understand filling ratio at admission delivery
post delivery postnatal care PNC and discharge
Data of all those women who had delivered at
ASMAN facilities and their newborns between
November and March in Rajasthan
and Madhya Pradesh states are used for this ana
lysis Till March data of women
Usmanova et al BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
who delivered and newborns were en
tered in ASMAN application
The observation checklist was developed based on
WHO SCC and was approved by GOI as part of
monitoring activities under Dakshata program
This checklist was designed to measure adherence
to essential practices around childbirth These
practices were divided by pause points practices
that are necessary to perform on admission just
before pushing or before caesarean soon after
birth h and before discharge This tool was used
to explore adherence to practices at the baseline and
latest assessment periods The program officers
with medical background collected this information
the observation assessment on average took h
Complication format Maternal and New Born
Complications Identification and Referral
Monitoring System Since there is no formal
mechanism in the government systems to monitor
childbirth and new born related complication and
management complication format was introduced
by ASMAN program team with the support from
the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan
The complication reporting format captured data on
key maternal and newborn health indicators from
the labour room postpartum ward Sick Newborn
Care Unit SNCU admissions and discharge
department of the facility This format captured data
on total deliveries type of deliveries fresh stillbirths
preterm births maternal and neonatal death
maternal complications pre eclampsia eclampsia
sepsis postpartum haemorrhage sepsis neonatal
complications neonatal asphyxia and sepsis refer
in and refer out data for maternal and neonatal
complications One nodal person preferably a
labour room staff was selected from each
intervention facility to act as the key contact person
for this initiative and was validated regularly by
ASMAN program team This tool was used to
explore effect of ASMAN application on delivery
outcomes
Data analysis
To describe uptake of ASMAN application we com
puted the filling rates of key data fields of the applica
tion and analysed the differences by pause points level
of health facility and average annual delivery load at the
health facilities
To analyze the change in adherence to evidence based
practices after roll out of the intervention we combined
the baseline assessment and last periodic assessment
data sets For overall univariate analysis of adherence to
key clinical practices before and after comparison we
computed means for before and latest intervention
Page of
periods and compared them using chi square test For
adherence to evidence based practices we also per
formed multivariable logistic regression analysis for each
practice while adjusting for level of facility average de
livery load at the facility and availability of resources re
quired for each key practice
To analyze trends in maternal and neonatal complica
tions and referrals we utilized the monthly complication
format data which was shared by all ASMAN interven
tion facilities As the intervention was rolled out in a
staggered manner at different time points across project
health facilities we categorized the complication data of
each facility into two time periods corresponding to be
fore and after intervention roll out
Within each time period we further grouped monthly
data into quarterly data months data such that each
quarter represented a time interval relative to the inter
vention roll out For example Q and Q denoted
the periods corresponding to months before and
months after intervention rollout respectively The
month of intervention roll out together with subsequent
months were denoted as QO or quarter O or the time
interval corresponding to intervention roll out Data of
corresponding quarters was combined for all facilities
and this dataset was used for generating simple time
series plots line bar for analysing the trends before and
after intervention roll out
Single group interrupted time series regression analysis
was performed on two dependent variables fresh still
birth rate and incidence of neonatal asphyxia We
have conducted interrupted time series analysis for these
two outcomes as these were primary outcomes of the
intervention Monthly data was utilized for carrying out
this analysis yielding data for time points before and
after intervention roll out respectively M to M
before roll out and M to M after roll out Coef
ficients or parameters which represented a shift in the
level intercept of the dependent variable and a shift in
the rate of change slope of dependent variable after
intervention were computed along with confidence
intervals Newey west standard errors were utilized to
account for autocorrelation
For all statistical tests of significance p value
was considered significant We used Statistics package
for the Social Sciences SPSS version Stata version
and Microsoft Excel for data analysis

identification of pre eclampsia and eclampsia cases after
application roll out while referral out declined over the
same time period

Discussion
Our study described the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers the role of ASMAN appli
cation in improving adherence to key clinical practices
delivery outcomes and maternal complications We have
observed that introducing ASMAN application resulted
in statistically significant improvements in adherence to
key clinical practices However overall completeness of
case sheets in ASMAN application was low across all
levels of facilities We have observed reduction in fresh

still birth rates and asphyxia but these results were not
statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
On the other hand our analysis showed that identifica
tion of maternal complications has increased over the
period of program implementation and at the same time
referral outs decreased
Uptake of ASMAN application
We have included completeness of case sheets in appli
cation as a measure of data quality as it is a commonly
assessed dimension of data quality mentioned in a re
view Although using medical records has been
criticized for measuring quality of record keeping prac
tices instead of quality of care it was argued that patient
case records should be part of quality of care assessment
because individual case records are essential not only for
case management and peer review but also for assessing
the impact of health interventions Additionally it
was noted that clinical record keeping enables continuity
of care and improves communication between different
health providers

Our results indicated that the filling ratio during the
post partum period was low across all type of facilities
The poor clinical documentation was reported in a re
view of obstetric records conducted in India with
the extent of documentation varying between as
sessment of mother s condition at the discharge and
admission date Similarly a multicenter retro
spective review of clinical records of cesarean delivery in
five low income countries identified poor quality record
keeping with missing information on key events man
agement of complications and delivery outcomes
Furthermore we have found that the filling ratio across
all pause points was low at the district hospital level and
high delivery load facilities In our qualitative study
health care providers mentioned that staff shortage pa
tient urgency high caseloads prevented staff to complete
all fields in the application According to a study
conducted by Chaturvedi and colleagues Madhya
Pradesh state of India documentation was better at dis
trict hospitals due to higher qualification of the staff in
those facilities and availability of forms at the district
hospitals Although the present study did not conduct

more it was noted by the same study that the data
captured electronically was easily available to providers
compare to paper based records Understanding the rea
sons for the low filling ratios at the PNC period would
require further research The low filling ratio at facilities
with delivery load more than could be explained by
bigger client provider ratio could be reasons as per an
ecdotal experience
Adherence to key clinical practices
Our study revealed that quality of care across all pause
points improved during the implementation of ASMAN
application Furthermore labor room staff in the
qualitative study mentioned that ASMAN application
improved their ability to take a complete history and
physical exam identify high risk patients manage cases
confidently facilitate provider communication improve
reporting processes and ensure continuity of care for re
ferral patients In our study we have observed that
examinations around identification and management of
complications initiation of partograph identification of
post partum haemorrhage increased significantly These
results indicate that ASMAN application has the poten
tial to improve quality of care provided around the
childbirth These are very encouraging results as timely
identification of complications is crucial because over a
third of maternal deaths a significant proportion of
pregnancy related life threatening conditions approxi
mately half of all stillbirths and a quarter of neonatal
deaths are attributed to complications that occur during
labour childbirth or the immediate postpartum period
Our findings are in line with the results of three
systematic reviews on the role of CDSS use on providers
adherence to clinical practices According to

Garg and colleagues better performance of pro
viders was observed in studies where users were auto
matically prompted to use the systems compared with
studies in which users were required to actively initi
ate the system Additionally the same review ob
served better performance in studies in which the
trial authors also developed the CDSS software
Moreover a synthesis of high quality systematic re
views showed that the positive effect of CDSS
depends on the services which it was used CDSS
positively impacted providers performance in studies
on drugs ordering and preventive care measures
Kawamoto et al identified four features strongly
associated with a decision support system s ability to
improve clinical practice a decision support pro
vided automatically as part of clinician workflow b
decision support delivered at the time and location of
decision making c actionable recommendations pro
vided and d computer based Additionally CDSS
should also provide periodic performance feedback
request documentation of the reason for not following
system recommendations and share decision support
results with patients
While there are studies on benefits of CDSS in general
there is very limited research on benefits of CDCC in
maternity care Duysburgh et al did not find a sig
nificant improvement in quality of antenatal and delivery
care with the use of CDSS assessed in Burkina Faso
Ghana and Tanzania They have concluded that history
taking counselling health education laboratory investi
gations and examination and monitoring of mothers
and newborns during childbirth were not performed ac
cording to the standards A study conducted in South
Africa for improving compliance of health care workers
with antenatal care guidelines found overall improve
ment but it was not statistically significant
McNabb et al reports significant improvement in health
counselling technical services quality of health educa
tion and patient satisfaction as a result of a mobile
phone decision support during antenatal care in Nigeria
Furthermore studies conducted in India on the role of
CDSS in the management of cardiovascular diseases
and hypertension demonstrated positive role of
CDSS in improving care adherence to guidelines coun
selling and follow up with patients that resulted in blood
pressure reduction
Delivery outcomes and maternal complications
Improved practices around childbirth have a potential to
prevent birth asphyxia and complications due to prema
turity which are some of the main causes of fresh still
births and early neonatal deaths Our results
revealed that there was a significant decrease in fresh
Page of
still birth and asphyxia however this decrease wasn t sta
tistically significant in interrupted time series analysis
These results are in line with the global evidence on the
lack of evidence of potential impact of CDSS on patient
outcomes Thus according to the sys
tematic review majority of the studies assessed patient
outcomes often without adequate statistical power to de
tect clinically important differences Jaspers and col
leagues found only few studies on impact of CDSS on
patient outcomes though many of these have been too
small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinic
ally important effect Furthermore a systematic re
view and meta analysis found that CDSS linked to
electronic health records did not detect statistically sig
nificant reduction in morbidity and mortality
The lack of statistically significant improvement in de
livery outcomes could be attributed to the small sample
size and short follow up periods which is not long
enough to assess the impact of CDSS on patient out
comes
During the course of the program implementation
we have observed that identification of pre eclampsia
is increased while referrals for the
