e interviews in the following remarks
do you know that evil people can harm your pregnancy They can cast a curse
spell on you and your unborn baby so the young pregnant women here who like
quarreling and fighting some ended up having a difficulty childbirth Interview
participant
This finding was supported by other participants who spoke of some young pregnant
mothers visiting spiritual churches to seek protection for fear the effects of curses by people
they might have wronged
They young pregnant mothers go the spiritual churches to pray for successful
pregnancy because they are afraid somebody that they have quarreled with or
disrespected might have cursed them and the pregnancy FGD participants
Discussion
Although the findings from this study do not represent the views of all Ghanaian
women they provide some insight into the general perception and knowledge of risk
factors for negative pregnancy and childbirth outcomes among women in Ghana The
findings indicated that participants view pregnancy as an exciting and unique experience
however they acknowledged the risks both medical and spiritual associated with it This
perception of risk could serve as a motivation for women to adopt positive health seeking
behaviors such as attending antenatal clinics exercising and eating good food during
pregnancy However this perception of risk can also induce serious emotional experiences
such as fear anxiety and stress that will require both informal and professional support
On the contrary it seems that some women in the study area were not adequately receiving
this support during pregnancy This might be one of the reasons why maternal health
outcomes in the study area are reported to be poor The findings of the study are
consistent with previous studies where women were found to hold such perceptions of
risks Anxiety and fear due to perceived risks in pregnancy and childbirth such
as prolonged and painful labor lack of social support as well as economic uncertainty
leading to stress were identified among women in studies by Erickson et al Lyberg
and Severinson and Saisto and Halmesmaki Thus pregnancy risk perceptions
among pregnant women can affect their health and health care decisions and treatment
options
The findings that women perceived a lack of social support as a risk factor for preg
nancy is relevant As confirmed by previous studies people with a high quality or quantity
of social networks and economic stability have a decreased risk of mortality in comparison
with those who have a low quality or quantity of social network engagement and are eco
nomically unstable In pregnancy in particular Hotelling and colleagues found
that women with continuous support either emotionally or socially were less likely to have
complications in pregnancy that could lead to Caesarean deliveries than those without any
support Likewise evidence from Ghana indicated that lack of support from friends and
extended family being abandoned by one s husband and being compelled to live with
unfriendly in laws are risk factors that could expose pregnant women to psychological
problems during pregnancy
Several studies have illustrated that poor women are at higher risk of food insuf
ficiency insecurity and poor feeding practices leading to malnutrition and maternal
morbidity Poverty hinders access to sufficient and nutritious food and at the
same time acts as a barrier to accessing quality and timely maternal health care
In Kenya for example Izugbara and Ngilangwa found that poverty compelled
Women
pregnant women in slums to engage in tedious work for long hours in order to save
enough money for delivery risking their lives Women in our study shared similar views
regarding young migrant pregnant women who carry heavy loads and work longer
hours for a living and in preparation for delivery
The findings showed that participants had knowledge of some common medical
risks associated with negative pregnancy outcomes in Ghana In Ghana like many other
tropical countries malaria is endemic and it is known to be a major contributing factor to
stillbirths Medical conditions such as diabetes candidiasis high blood pressure
HIV anemia and delayed placenta as well as lack of physical activity are also risk factors
that were identified as dangers to pregnancy and childbirth These findings are consistent
with a study conducted in Kenya where participants identified similar conditions as threats
to positive pregnancy outcomes
Our participants had a strong belief in religious spiritual factors such as curses as
risk factors in pregnancy These beliefs are rooted in the community and are not only
widespread among Ghanaians but also exist in many cultures in sub Saharan Africa This
belief has an influence on health care choices and decisions during pregnancy and childbirth
and motivates most women to resort to herbal medicine spiritual care faith healing and
prayer or a combination of medical and traditional treatments during pregnancy
In rural Zimbabwe for example it has been discovered that women fear being bewitched
because they are thought to be vulnerable to witchcraft in the early months of pregnancy
As such they preferred to seek protection from faith healers who are believed to possess
supernatural powers to protect them and their pregnancy Similar findings have also
been observed in studies in Southern America and indigenous Pilipino in Southeast
Asia Interestingly this notion according to the authors is parallel to the biomedical
perspective which describes the early months of pregnancy as the most critical period
Unlike in many western cultures women in Ghana fully cover their pregnancy during the
entire pregnancy period This practice is believed to protect the pregnancy from a curse
spell or witchcraft
Implications
As governments are making efforts to address the challenges of poor maternal health
outcomes the need for research that has practical applications is essential Our findings
revealed many issues that are relevant for maternal and child healthcare policies and
programs for low income women in Ghana First the findings suggest that many pregnant
women go through psychological issues during pregnancy due to the perceived risks
associated with it Although medical interventions such as antenatal care are important
during pregnancy psychological support is equally important Pregnancy induces physical
and emotional change and increases the risk of mental illness Psychological support
for women during pregnancy is therefore very important for positive outcomes The
Ministry of Health in consultation with other relevant stakeholders such as the department
of Social Welfare should consider the implementation of social and emotional support
programs that can help to alleviate the emotional stress of pregnant women especially for
poor and single women Counseling units specifically focusing on pregnant women could
be set up at the maternal and childcare units of health care centers to support women who
need help
Second the belief that pregnant women could be cursed has implications for safe
motherhood policies and programs in Ghana As the findings indicated some pregnant
women use traditional medical practitioners including faith healers due to the belief that
they could be cursed This does not promote safe motherhood practices and should be
addressed Public health education must focus on explaining to women and communities
the risk and non risk factors associated with pregnancy and childbirth as well as correcting
misperceptions that may have a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes
Third the impact of poverty was a major risk factor identified by the participants
Current socio economic conditions in the country are having dire consequences on the poor
Women

and this could seriously affect Ghana s quest to achieve its Sustainable Development Goal
Poverty among women needs serious attention through protective social interventions The
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Gender Children and Social Protection could partner
with community organizations including churches and other religious groups to augment
government efforts to reduce poverty among deprived communities
Conclusions
The findings of the study revealed that low income urban women in Ghana have
a wide range of knowledge and perceptions of risk factors for negative pregnancy and
childbirth outcomes The women viewed pregnancy as a unique experience but they
acknowledged that it could be affected by a host of medical and non medical issues
which could lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes including negatively affecting the health
of the mother and the baby Though the study focused on urban women these risk
perceptions and knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth are held by many Ghanaian
women The findings also suggest that despite efforts being made to reduce maternal
morbidity and mortality in Ghana many pregnant women are still at risk of pregnancy
related complications This study therefore brings to the fore the need to employ multiple
approaches to safe motherhood programs social economic religious and psychological
to help poor pregnant women While these activities will reduce barriers to quality maternal
healthcare health education should be ramped up to address superstitious beliefs as well
as cultural misperceptions about pregnancy risk factors

Prenatal Weight Gain and Postpartum Weight
Retention A Delicate Balance
Everyone agrees that women are
supposed to grow larger with pregnancy
but great controversy has surrounded rec
ommendations for prenatal weight gain
throughout the century Forty years
ago most American obstetricians be
lieved that maternal weight gain caused
maternal antenatal and intrapartum com
plications as well as obesity and restric
tion of prenatal weight gain to a maximum
of or pounds was common practice
In the National Academy of Sci
ences concluded that limiting maternal
weight gain was potentially harmful be
cause it increased the risk of low fetal
birthweight and its concurrent morbidity
and mortality For the years that fol
lowed prenatal weight gain recommenda
tions hovered between and pounds
and research examining maternal weight
gain intensified During this time almost
all of the studies were to assess
how maternal gain related to fetal out
come
In the Institute of Medicine an
alyzed the scientific evidence relating to
weight gain during and formu
lated new recommendations for healthy
gestational weight gain These guidelines
which have been widely disseminated are
individualized on the basis of body mass
index criteria according to the mother s
weight for height prior to pregnano The
specific weight gain targets for under
weight normal weight overweight and
obese women are to lb to lb
to lb and a minimum of lb re
spectively The Institute of Medicine rec
ommendations also encourage young ad
olescents and Black women groups at
especially high risk for low birthweight to
gain at the higher end of their specific body
mass index range and short women who
may be at increased risk for fetopelvic dis
proportion to gain at the lower end of the
range The development of weight gain
recommendations based on body mass in
dex was a result of the Institute s findin
that the effect of a given weight gain on
fetal size diminishes as the mother s
prepregnant body size increases The rec
omxnendation of a range of gain rather
than a single figure reflected evidence that
a great variability in matemal weight gain
is observed among women with good
pregnan outcomes
A major objective of these recom
mendations is to optimize fetal birth
weight Although the Institute recognizes
that low birthweight is caused by multiple
factors and that maternal weight gain is
not a panacea its recommendations are
designed to promote matemal weight gain
as one way of protecting the fetus
Can promoting maternal weight gain
also be harmful Determining the health
iest matemal weight gain requires that we
consider other outcomes in addition to fe
tal outcomes Unfortunately much less is
known about how prenatal weight gain af
fects the pregnancy labor and delivery
experience or the long term health of the
mother In an attempt to address concerns
about maternal health the authors of the
Institute of Medicine report considered
evidence that very high maternal gain in
creases high fetal weight and its compli
cations and may also increase postpartum
obesity From the limited data available
they estimated an upper limit of weight
gain At the same time they called for new
studies to evaluate the impact of gesta
tional weight gain on maternal pregnan

outcome and maternal obesity and they
specifically identified the need to test the
recommended weight gain ranges against
specific pregnancy outcomes
In this issue of the Journal Keppel
and respond to this challenge
Their analysis of selected participants in
the National Maternal and Infant
Survey suggests a strong and positive as
sociation between prenatal weight gain
and postpartum weight retention to
months after birth More than one third of
the respondents reported weight gains that
exceeded the Institute of Medicine recom
mendations and this group retained a me
dian of lb women who gained less than
the recommended amount retained a me
dian of lb and women who gained
within the recommended range retained a
median of lb When the data were ex
amined separately by race there was little
evidence that White women retained ex
cess weight postpartum when they gained
within the recommended range How
ever at every level of weight gain Black
women reported retaining much more
weight than did YOIite women For exam
ple when prenatal gain was below within
and above the recommended range the
proportions of White women who retained
lb or more were and
respectively whereas among Black
women these proportions were
and
The racial differential in weight reten
tion among National Maternal and Infant
Survey participants was also evident in a
recent multivariate analysis that examined
risk factors for excessive retention de
fined as retention of at least lb an av
erage of months postpartum in women
who began with a normal body
mass index After controlling for a vari
ety of potentialb confounding variables
the researchers found that excessive
weight retention was twice as frequent
among Black than among White mothers
Risk factors for weight retention differed
in the two groups For example high par
ity was predictive of weight retention only
for Black women and marital status was
predictive only for White women Both
low socioeconomic status and weight gain
above the recommended range however
were associated with a doubled risk of
weight retention for both races
The finding that postpartum weight
retention is relatively low in White women
who gain within the recommended range
amrms the usefulness of the Institute of
Medicine weight gain recommendations
at least for part of the US population This
information can be added to other evi
August Vol No
dence suggesting that women who gain
within the recommended ranges have bet
ter pregnang outcomes than do women
who gain above or below them
It is not surprising that women with
large gestational weight gains will take
longer to lose weight postpartum than
those who gain less How can we help
women to gain within the recommended
range What should we do when it ap
pears that a gravid woman is gaining far
more than the amount recommended Be
fore we allow the concept of ri d calorie
restriction for pregnant women once more
to rear its ugly head we should remember
that placing pregnant women on restricted
diets not only restricted fetal growth but
also created enormous stress between
women and their obstetrical caregivers
years ago Yet we know that the dietary
practices and activity patterns of many
American women are not as good as they
should be Perhaps the best approach at
this point is to provide individualized as
sessment and sensitive counseling as part
of prenatal and postpartum care to en
courage good nutrition for every woman
Clinical guidelines to support such care
have recently been published
The more complicated issue is how to
interpret the finding that at any level of
weight gain Black women retain more
weight postpartum than do White women
A possible explanation is suggested by an
other national survey that is reported in
this issue of the Joumal Data from the
and Continuing Surveys of
Food Intakes by Individuals were exam
ined to compare reported mean enery in
takes for women before during and after
pregnancy Among the nonlactating
women White women appeared to de
crease their enery intake after preg
nan whereas Black women reported
mean increases of kcal kJ over
their prepreglant intake during the first
months after birth and more than kcal
kJ over their prepregnant intakes
later in the postpartum year Thus there is
evidence that Black women may be re
taining weight because they are not cutting
back on their energy intake whereas
White women are A sunilar finding has
been reported for adult women who were
not postpartum
It is also possible that the racial dif
ference in postpartum weight retention
may be attributable to problems in study
methodoloy The cross sectional design
of the National Maternal and Infant Sur
vey does not allow us to know whether the
postpartum maternal weight represents
retention of prenatal weight gain or a re
Editorials
gain of weight following an initial loss
There are undoubtably inaccuracies in re
called weights as a result of the retrospec
tive data collection and it is also possible
that there may be differential recall bias by
race However we cannot ignore evi
dence that postpartum weight retention
differs by race in a nationally representa
twe sample We must now follow up this
finding with carefully conducted research
to examine differences in and risk factors
for postpartum weight retention in a vari
ety of population subgroups
As pointed out by Krieger s annota
tion in this issue of the Journal we often
devote a great deal of enery to defining
biomedical outcomes but are much less
precise and thoughtful about defining the
social factors that predict the outcomes
As we design future studies we should
keep in mind the fact that currently avail
able data allow us to classify women by
race but it is likely that race is simply a
proxy for social economic environmen
tal cultural and other factors that influ
ence women s health

Improving Cause of Death Statistics The Case of Fetal Deaths
One could say that modem public
health virtually began with the national
system of mortality statistics for England
and Wales instituted by William Farr in
The vital statistics system has been
a valuable and essential public health re
source Over the years the information
provided has not only enhanced our un
derstanding of the magnitude and causes
of death and illness but has influenced the
direction of many health initiatives With
the advent of the Department of Health
and Human Services Healthy People
objectives many of which are based
on health measurements of cause of death
derived from the vital statistics system
and with the apparent federal policy of
linking these objectives to funding of pub
lic health progams the need for timely
vital statistics of high quality is even more
pronounced
Recent interest in tracking health out
comes has once again raised questions
about the reliability of cause of death in
formation Numerous articles have been
written on the subject and at least one na
tional workshop has been held
tions have been made about ways to im
prove both the quality and completeness
of reporting cause of death on the death
certificate The article by Kirby in this is
sue of the Journal fetal deaths into
the debate
As a component of the vital statistics
system fetal death reports should be
viewed as a source of information for
monitoring the health of mothers and in
fants during the perinatal period Many
current proposals to lower infant and per
inatal mortality focus on preventive health
care during pregnancy and on the problem
of preterm delivery This focus shifts the
emphasis of research and delivery pro
grams from intervention to prevention and
from infants to pregnancies As the shifts
occur we need to sharpen the distinctions
between intrapartum fetal deaths those
that occur during labor and late antepar
tum fetal deaths those that occur before
labor and between early and late fetal
death
The need for reliable cause of death
statistics on all pregnancies in which the
American Journal of Public Health
fetus was unable to survive to ftill devel
opment is becoming more evident Such
statistics would provide much needed in
formation on the causes of perinatal
deaths many of which occur before birth
In North Carolina for example there
were fetal deaths of or more weeks
gestation reported in compared with
neonatal deaths Refining these num
bers further there were fetal plus
early neonatal less than week s gesta
tion deaths reported compared with
deaths of infants aged days or older
The call for increased surveillance of
the causes of fetal deaths has gained mo
mentum In for example the Na
tional Center for Health Statistics NCHS
and the states agreed to include cause of
fetal death data in the Vital Statistics Co
operative Program contract Soon after
ward preliminary instructions were issued
on coding cause of fetal death and editing
querying and quality control of fetal death
reports A NCHS survey revealed
that about of the responding states
out of were either using the draft
procedures in or planning to use them
in M MacDorman PhD written
communication January
Concurrently with these guidelines
NCHS commenced two evaluations re
lated to fetal death reports One involved
an assessment of the feasibility and cost of
querying these reports and the current
coding procedures and practices of the
various states The second was the
National Maternal and Infant Health Sur
vey which incorporated a component on
assessing the quality and completeness of
underlying data The
results were to be used to evaluate the
feasibility of coding cause of fetal death
data on the National Vital Statistics file
The recent attention to fetal death
coding in combination with the prelimi
nary NCHS guidelines has not yet re
duced the high proportion of fetal records
with imprecise cause of death informa
tion Kirby s analysis of five states re
vealed that the percentage of such records
ranged from to in the period
through In the National Maternal
and Infant Health Survey NCHS found
a comparable overall percentage
but much wider variance among the states
to Even in North Carolina in
which Kirby found a imprecise
record rate significantly high proportions
of fetal reports with imprecise cause of
death information continue to exist If we
apply Kirby s definitions to and
records for example and re
spectively of North Carolina fetal records
had imprecise cause of death informa
tion
Interestingly about of the North
Carolina fetal deaths in and
were autopsied Of those autopsied about
per year had an imprecise un
derlying cause of death Further study is
needed to determine why more precise
causes were not listed on the fetal reports
after autopsy
Clearly insumcient priority has been
given to improving cause of death report
ing on the fetal records No national uni
form coding and query rules have been
published Implementation of the Mortal
ity Indexing Classification and Retrieval
System MICAR electronic cer
tificates and current vital statistics flow
procedures have preoccupied NCHS and
relegated the development of stringent
and uniform coding classification and
query rules for fetal deaths to the back
burner Kirby s study suggests and most
would concur that NCHS needs to move
this issue forward
Yet one needs to question whether
the expectations proposed in the article
are realistic Have we overstated the po
tential of the fetal death report information
relative to the cost of additional proce
dures What will more accurate informa
tion add to what we already know as a
basis for policy decisions about perinatal
programs and is the fetal death registra
tion system the best avenue to capture
that type of information These poli is
sues and others will need to be addressed
as we debate appropriate strategies to en
hance the cause of fetal death informa
tion

There is level I evidence that screening for and treating gestational diabetes in singleton pregnancies reduce maternal and neonatal
morbidity However similar data for gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies are currently lacking Consequently the current approach for
the diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies is based on the same diagnostic criteria and glycemic targets
used in singleton pregnancies However twin pregnancies have unique physiological characteristics and many of the typical gestational
diabetes related complications are less relevant for twin pregnancies These differences raise the question of whether the greater increase
in insulin resistance observed in twin pregnancies which is often diagnosed as diet treated gestational diabetes should be considered
physiological and potentially beneficial in which case alternative criteria should be used for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies In this review we summarize the most up to date evidence on the epidemiology pathophysiology and clinical conse
quences of gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies and review the available data on twin specific screening and diagnostic criteria for
gestational diabetes Although twin pregnancies are associated with a higher incidence of diet treated gestational diabetes diet treated
gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies is less likely to be associated with adverse outcomes and accelerated fetal growth than in
singleton pregnancies and may reduce the risk for intrauterine growth restriction In addition there is currently no evidence that treatment
of diet treated gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies improves outcomes whereas preliminary data suggest that strict glycemic control
in such cases might increase the risk for intrauterine growth restriction Overall these findings provide support to the hypothesis that the
greater transient increase in insulin resistance observed in twin pregnancies is merely a physiological exaggeration of the normal increase
in insulin resistance observed in singleton pregnancies that is meant to support fetuses rather than a pathology that requires treatment
These data illustrate the need to develop twin specific screening and diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes to avoid overdiagnosis of
gestational diabetes and to reduce the risks associated with overtreatment of diet treated gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies
Although data on twin specific screening and diagnostic criteria are presently scarce preliminary data suggest that the optimal screening
and diagnostic criteria in twin pregnancies are higher than those currently used in singleton pregnancies

Introduction
Gestational diabetes GDM is a com
mon pregnancy complication
affecting to of the pregnancies
in North America Approximately
decades ago it was questioned whether
GDM is a distinct disease that is associ
ated with adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes to an extent that it justifies
routine screening and treatment or
whether it is in fact a nonentity This
controversy has largely been resolved
following the publication of large trials
that provided evidence that the diagnosis
and treatment of GDM improve preg
nancy outcomes However these trials
were limited to singleton pregnancies
and therefore comparable data to sup
port the benefits of screening for and
treatment of GDM in twin pregnancies
are lacking This has been acknowledged
in a recent statement by the Society for
Maternal Fetal Medicine on the state of
science on multifetal gestations accord
ing to which twins have been represented
in only of the trials on GDM and
this is also reflected in the lack of any
specific guidance from professional so
cieties on the diagnosis and management
of GDM in twin pregnancies Conse
quently the contemporary approach for
the diagnosis and management of GDM
in twin pregnancies is based on the same
diagnostic criteria and glycemic targets
used in singleton pregnancies
However twin pregnancies have
unique physiological characteristics
such as a greater increase in insulin
resistance and greater nutritional
demands
In addition many of the
typical GDM related complications are
much less relevant to twin pregnancies
as discussed later
These differ
ences raise the question of whether the
greater insulin resistance and the asso
ciated relative hyperglycemia observed
in twin pregnancies should be viewed as
physiological and potentially beneficial
in which case alternative criteria should
be used for the screening and diagnosis
of GDM in twin pregnancies
The goal of this review was to address
this question by summarizing the most
up to date evidence on the epidemi
ology pathophysiology and clinical

Although several

others failed to observe such differences

These conflicting re

of previous studies including small
sample sizes
a lack of
adjustment for confounding variables
such as maternal age obesity and
and failure to differentiate

Based on these large scale
findings it was concluded that the
higher incidence of GDM in twin preg
nancies is a consequence of a greater
predisposition for GDMAI
What is the pathophysiology of
gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies
The higher incidence of GDMAI in twin
pregnancies may be explained by differ
ences in the pathophysiology of GDM
In singleton pregnancies GDM has been
attributed primarily to a failure of the
maternal pancreas to compensate for the
physiological increase in insulin resis
tance in pregnancy most likely because
of an underlying subclinical maternal
beta cell dysfunction Figure l
This mechanism is responsible for the
well established association between
GDM and future maternal type
diabetes
In twin pregnancies a certain pro
portion of cases of GDM may likely be
the consequence of a greater transient
increase in insulin resistance observed in

these pregnancies because of the greater
placental mass and subsequently the
higher
levels
of diabetogenic
hormones
in the presence of
normal beta cell function or a lesser de
gree of beta cell dysfunction than that
observed in cases of GDM in singleton
pregnancies Thus GDM may occur in
twin pregnancies despite a pancreatic
response that would have been sufficient
to compensate for the typical increase in
insulin resistance seen in singleton
pregnancies but that is insufficient to
counteract the greater increase in insulin
resistance that occurs with twin gesta
tions
Figure This hypothesis is sup
ported by the observation that women
who had GDM in a twin pregnancy are
approximately less likely to develop
type diabetes following the index
pregnancy than those who had GDM in a
singleton pregnancy Figure
Is gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies associated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes
Regardless of the mechanisms underly
ing GDM in twins the question that is
most relevant for clinicians is if GDM in
twins is associated with the same com
plications reported in singleton preg
nancies namely accelerated fetal growth
macrosomia shoulder dystocia birth
trauma preeclampsia cesarean delivery
and neonatal complications such as hy
poglycemia jaundice and respiratory
morbidity
The rationale underlying this question
is clear Some of these complications
such as macrosomia and shoulder
dystocia are unlikely to be clinically
relevant for twin pregnancies given that
twin fetuses are born earlier and are
smaller on average than singleton fe
tuses Other complications such as
preeclampsia cesarean delivery and
neonatal complications are more com
mon in twin gestations irrespective of
GDM because of the greater placental
mass fetal malpresentation and higher
rates of prematurity respectively
and thus GDM especially GDMAI is
unlikely to have a major impact on the
risks of these complications in twin
pregnancies

In singleton pregnancies upper panel GDM has been attributed primarily to a failure of the maternal
pancreas to compensate for the physiological increase in insulin resistance during pregnancy This
mechanism is responsible for the well established association between GDM and future maternal
type diabetes In twin pregnancies lower a certain proportion of cases of GDMAI may likely
be caused by the greater transient increase in insulin resistance observed in these pregnancies
rather than from underlying maternal beta cell dysfunction despite an adequate pancreatic
response that would have been sufficient to compensate for the normal increase in insulin resistance
seen in singleton pregnancies but that is insufficient to counteract the greater increase in insulin
