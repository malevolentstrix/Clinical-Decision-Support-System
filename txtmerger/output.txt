Physical Activity and Exercise During Pregnancy and
the Postpartum Period
ABSTRACT: Exercise, defined as physical activity consisting of planned, structured, and repetitive bodily
movements done to improve one or more components of physical fitness, is an essential element of a healthy
lifestyle, and obstetrician—gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should encourage their patients to
continue or to commence exercise as an important component of optimal health. Women who habitually engaged
in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or who were physically active before pregnancy can continue these activities
during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Observational studies of women who exercise during pregnancy
have shown benefits such as decreased gestational diabetes mellitus, cesarean birth and operative vaginal deliv-
ery, and postpartum recovery time. Physical activity also can be an essential factor in the prevention of depressive
disorders of women in the postpartum period. Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are associated
with minimal risks and have been shown to benefit most women, although some modification to exercise routines
may be necessary because of normal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal requirements. In the absence of
obstetric or medical complications or contraindications, physical activity in pregnancy is safe and desirable, and
pregnant women should be encouraged to continue or to initiate safe physical activities. This document has been
revised to incorporate recent evidence regarding the benefits and risks of physical activity and exercise during
pregnancy and the postpartum period.
Recommendations
Regular physical activity in all phases of life, including
pregnancy, promotes health benefits. Pregnancy is an
ideal time for maintaining or adopting a healthy lifestyle
and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecol-
ogists makes the following recommendations:
Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are
associated with minimal risks and have been shown
to benefit most women, although some modification
to exercise routines may be necessary because of
normal anatomic and physiologic changes and fetal
requirements.
A thorough clinical evaluation should be conducted
before recommending an exercise program to ensure
that a patient does not have a medical reason to avoid
exercise.

• Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be
encouraged to engage in aerobic and strength-
conditioning exercises before, during, and after
pregnancy.
Obstetrician—gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should evaluate women with medical or
obstetric complications carefully before making rec-
ommendations on physical activity participation during
pregnancy. Activity restriction should not be prescribed
routinely as a treatment to reduce preterm birth.
Additional research is needed to study the effects of
exercise on pregnancy-specific conditions and out-
comes and to clarify further effective behavioral coun-
seling methods and the optimal type, frequency, and
intensity of exercise. Similar research is needed to create
an improved evidence base concerning the effects of
occupational physical activity on maternal—fetal health.
OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY


Introduction
This document has been revised to incorporate recent
evidence regarding the benefits and risks of physical
activity and exercise during pregnancy and the post-
partum period. Physical activity, defined as any bodily
movement produced by the contraction of skeletal
muscles (1) in all stages of life, maintains and improves
cardiorespiratory fitness, reduces the risk of obesity and
associated comorbidities, and results in greater longev-
ity. Women who begin their pregnancy with a healthy
lifestyle (eg, exercise, good nutrition, nonsmoking)
should be encouraged to maintain those healthy habits.
Women who do not have healthy lifestyles should be
encouraged to view the prepregnancy period and preg-
nancy as opportunities to embrace healthier routines.
Exercise, defined as physical activity consisting of
planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movements
done to improve one or more components of physical
fitness (1), is an essential element of a healthy lifestyle,
and obstetrician—gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should encourage their patients to continue
or to commence exercise as an important component of
optimal health.
The World Health Organization and the American
College of Sports Medicine have issued evidence-based
recommendations indicating that the beneficial effects of
exercise in most adults are indisputable and that the
benefits far outweigh the risks (2, 3).
The 2018 update to the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Physical Activity Guidelines for
Americans reinforces prior recommendations of at least
150 minutes of moderate intensity aerobic activity per
week during pregnancy and the postpartum period (4).
This activity should be spread throughout the week. The
guidelines advise that women who habitually engaged in
vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or who were physi-
cally active before pregnancy can continue these activi-
ties during pregnancy and the postpartum period.
Additionally, women who are pregnant should be under
the care of an obstetrician-gynecologist or other obstetric
care provider who can monitor the progress of the preg-
nancy. Women who are pregnant can consult their
obstetrician—gynecologist or other obstetric care pro-
vider about whether or how to adjust their physical
activity during pregnancy and postpartum (4).
Physical inactivity is the fourth-leading risk factor
for early mortality worldwide (2). In pregnancy, physical
inactivity and excessive weight gain have been recog-
nized as independent risk factors for maternal obesity
and related pregnancy complications, including gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus (GDM) (5—7). Concerns that reg-
ular physical activity during pregnancy may cause
miscarriage, poor fetal growth, musculoskeletal injury,
or premature delivery have not been substantiated for
women with uncomplicated pregnancies (8—12). In the
absence of obstetric or medical complications or contra-
indications, physical activity in pregnancy is safe and
desirable, and pregnant women should be encouraged
to continue or to initiate safe physical activities (Box 1,
Box 2).
Most pregnant patients can exercise. There are few
maternal medical conditions in which aerobic exercise is
absolutely contraindicated. When questions exist regard-
ing safety of aerobic exercise in pregnancy, consultation
with relevant specialists and subspecialists (eg, obstetrics
and gynecology, maternal—fetal medicine, cardiology,
pulmonology), when indicated, is advised. In women
who have obstetric or medical comorbidities, exercise
regimens should be individualized. Obstetrician—
gynecologists and other obstetric care providers should
evaluate women with medical or obstetric complications
carefully before making recommendations on physical
activity participation during pregnancy.
Anatomic and Physiologic Aspects of
Exercise in Pregnancy
Pregnancy results in anatomic and physiologic changes
that should be considered when prescribing exercise. The
most distinct changes during pregnancy are weight gain
and a shift in the point of gravity that results in
progressive lordosis. These changes lead to an increase
in the forces across joints and the spine during weight-
bearing exercise. As a result, more than 60% of all
pregnant women experience low back pain (13).
Strengthening
abdominal and back muscles
could minimize this risk. Blood volume, heart rate, stroke
volume, and cardiac output normally increase during
pregnancy, and systemic vascular resistance decreases
(Table 1). These hemodynamic changes establish the cir-
culatory reserve necessary to sustain the pregnant
woman and fetus at rest and during exercise. Maintain-
ing a supine position during exercise after 20 weeks of
gestation may result in decreased venous return due to
aortocaval compression from the gravid uterus, leading
to hypotension, and this hemodynamic change should be

considered when prescribing exercise modifications in
pregnancy (14—16).
In pregnancy, there also are profound respiratory
changes. Minute ventilation increases up to 50%, pri-
marily as a result of the increased tidal volume. Because
of a physiologic decrease in pulmonary reserve, the
ability to exercise anaerobically is impaired, and oxygen
availability for aerobic exercise and increased work load
consistently lags. The physiologic respiratory alkalosis of
pregnancy may not be sufficient to compensate for the
developing metabolic acidosis of strenuous exercise.
Decreases in subjective work load and maximum exercise
performance in pregnant women, particularly in those
who are overweight or obese, limit their ability to engage
in more strenuous physical activities (17). Aerobic train-
ing in pregnancy has been shown to increase aerobic
capacity in normal weight and overweight pregnant
women (18—20).
Temperature regulation is highly dependent on
hydration and environmental conditions. During exer-
cise, pregnant women should stay well hydrated, wear
loose-fitting clothing, and avoid high heat and humidity
to protect against heat stress, particularly during the first
trimester (1). Although exposure to heat from sources
such as hot tubs, saunas, or fever has been associated
with an increased risk of neural tube defects (21), exer-
cise would not be expected to increase core body tem-
perature into the range of concern. At least one study
found no association between exercise and neural tube
defects (22).
Fetal Response to Maternal Exercise
Most of the studies addressing fetal response to maternal
exercise have focused on fetal heart rate changes and
birth weight. Studies have demonstrated minimum to
moderate increases in fetal heart rate by 10—30 beats
per minute over the baseline during or after exercise
(23—26). Three meta-analyses concluded that the dif-
ferences in birth weight were minimal to none in
women who exercised during pregnancy compared
with controls (27—29). However, women who contin-
ued to exercise vigorously during the third trimester
were more likely to deliver infants weighing 200—400 g
less than comparable controls, although there was not
an increased risk of fetal growth restriction (27—29). A
cohort study that assessed umbilical artery blood flow,
fetal heart rates, and biophysical profiles before and
after strenuous exercise in the second trimester dem-
onstrated that 30 minutes of strenuous exercise was
well tolerated by women and fetuses in active and
inactive pregnant women (26). More data are needed
from athletes who may exert beyond the accepted "vig-
orous" definition of up to 85% of capacity, and it is
possible that there is an absolute level of intensity (or
duration, or both) that exists, and if exceeded, could
place the fetus at risk. Individualized exercise prescrip-
tions may be warranted in pregnant athletes to ascer-
tain whether there is a threshold beyond which fetal
well-being may be compromised (30).
Benefits of Exercise During Pregnancy
The benefits of exercise during pregnancy are numerous
(Box 2) (31). Regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy
has been shown to improve or maintain physical fitness
(8, 9, 27). Observational studies of women who exercise
during pregnancy have shown benefits such as
decreased GDM (Odds Ratio [OR] 0.103; Cl,
0.013—0.803) (6, 32—34), cesarean birth (Relative Risk
0.69, 95% CI, 0.42, 0.82) (35) and operative vaginal
delivery (9, 35, 36), and postpartum recovery time (9).
Physical activity also can be an essential factor in the
prevention of depressive disorders of women in the
postpartum period (37, 38). In pregnancy, greater self-
reported overall physical fitness and cardiorespiratory
fitness are associated with less bodily pain, lumbar and
sciatic pain, and reduced pain disability (39). Studies
are needed to explore whether improving physical fit-
ness before and during pregnancy could decrease pain
during the peripartum period.
A 2017 randomized controlled trial that included
300 overweight or obese women with uncomplicated,
singleton gestations at less than 13 weeks of gestation
found that cycling exercises initiated in the first trimester
and performed at least 30 minutes, 3 times per week until
37 weeks of gestation, significantly reduced the incidence
of GDM, significantly reduced gestational weight gain at
less than 25 weeks of gestation, and lowered neonatal
birth weight (40). Although these investigators found no
significant differences between the exercise and control
groups in the incidence of other outcomes, such as pre-
term birth, gestational hypertension, cesarean birth, and
macrosomia, all these outcomes were less frequent in the
exercise group.

A 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis (41)
showed a significantly reduced risk of gestational hyper-
tensive disorders, gestational hypertension, and cesarean
birth in women who performed aerobic exercise 30—
60 minutes 2—7 times per week, as compared with
women who were more sedentary (41). Studies have
shown that exercise during pregnancy can lower glucose
levels in women with GDM (42, 43) or help prevent
preeclampsia (44). Exercise has shown only a modest
decrease in overall weight gain (1—2 kg) in normal
weight, overweight, and obese women (45, 46). Another
2017 systematic review and meta-analysis (47) showed
that, for overweight and obese women with a singleton
pregnancy, compared with women who were more sed-
entary, aerobic exercise for about 30—60 minutes 3—7
times per week during pregnancy is associated with
a reduction in the incidence of preterm birth (RR 0.62,
95% CI, 0.41—0.95) (47). Aerobic exercise in overweight
and obese pregnant women also is associated with a sig-
nificantly lower incidence of GDM and, therefore, should
be encouraged (47). A 2016 systematic review and meta-
analysis in normal-weight pregnant women with a single-
ton uncomplicated gestation showed that aerobic exer-
cise for 35—90 minutes 3—4 times per week is not
associated with an increased risk of preterm birth or with
a reduction in mean gestational age at delivery. Exercise

was associated with a significantly higher incidence of
vaginal delivery and a significantly lower incidence of
cesarean birth, with a significantly lower incidence of
GDM and hypertensive disorders (48). Finally, a 2019
systematic review and meta-analysis (49) found that in
mothers with pregestational medical conditions (chronic
hypertension, type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes), pre-
natal exercise reduced the odds of cesarean birth by 55%
and did not increase the risk of adverse maternal and
neonatal outcomes (OR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22—0.95)
although findings are based on limited evidence, suggest-
ing a need for high-quality investigations on exercise in
this population of women.
Recommending an Exercise Program
Motivational Counseling
Pregnancy is an ideal time for behavior modification and
adoption of a healthy lifestyle because of increased
motivation and frequent access to medical supervision.
Patients are more likely to control weight, increase
physical activity, and improve their diet if their physician
recommends that they do so (50). Motivational counsel-
ing tools such as the Five A's (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist,
and Arrange), originally developed for smoking cessa-
tion, have been used successfully for diet and exercise
counseling (51, 52). Obstetrician—gynecologists and
Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period e181


other obstetric care providers can consider adopting the
Five A's approach for women with uncomplicated
pregnancies who have no contraindications to exercise.
Prescribing an Individualized Exercise Program
The principles of exercise prescription for pregnant
women do not differ from those for the general
population (4). A thorough clinical evaluation should
be conducted before recommending an exercise program
to ensure that a patient does not have a medical reason to
avoid exercise. An exercise program that leads to an
eventual goal of moderate-intensity exercise for at least
20—30 minutes per day on most or all days of the week
should be developed with the patient and adjusted as
medically indicated.
Because blunted and normal heart-rate responses to
exercise have been reported in pregnant women, the use
of ratings of perceived exertion may be a more effective
means to monitor exercise intensity during pregnancy
than heart-rate parameters (53). For moderate-intensity
exercise, ratings of perceived exertion should be 13—14
(somewhat hard) on the Borg ratings of perceived exer-
tion scale (Table 2). Using the "talk test" is another way
to measure exertion: as long as a woman can carry on
a conversation while exercising, she likely is not over-
exerting herself (54). Women should be advised to
remain well hydrated, avoid long periods of lying flat
on their backs, and stop exercising if they have any of
the warning signs listed in Box 3.
Pregnant women who were sedentary before preg-
nancy should follow a more gradual progression of

exercise. Although an upper level of safe exercise
intensity has not been established, women who were
regular exercisers before pregnancy and who have
uncomplicated, healthy pregnancies should be able to
engage in high-intensity exercise programs, such as
jogging and aerobics, with no adverse effects. High-
intensity or prolonged exercise in excess of 45 minutes
can lead to hypoglycemia; therefore, adequate caloric
intake before exercise, or limiting the intensity or length
of the exercise session, is essential to minimize this risk
(55).
Prolonged exercise should be performed in a ther-
moneutral environment or in controlled environmental
conditions (facilities with air conditioning) and pregnant
women should avoid prolonged exposure to heat (56)
and pay close attention to proper hydration and caloric
intake. In studies of pregnant women who exercised in
which physical activity was self-paced in a temperature-
controlled environment, core body temperatures rose
less than 1.50C over 30 minutes and stayed within safe
limits (31). Table 3 lists suggestions for an exercise plan
in pregnancy (31). Finally, although physical activity and
dehydration in pregnancy have been associated with
a small increase in uterine contractions (57), a 2016 sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis in normal-weight preg-
nant women with singleton uncomplicated gestations
demonstrated that exercise for 35—90 minutes 3—4
times per week is not associated with an increased risk of
preterm birth or with a reduction in mean gestational age
at delivery (48).
Types of Exercises

Women with uncomplicated pregnancies should be

conditioning exercises before, during, and after preg-
nancy. Contact activities with high risk of abdominal

of the fetal pulmonary circulation to filter bubble forma-
tion (58). Women living at sea level were able to tolerate
physical activity up to altitudes of 6,000 feet, suggesting
this altitude is safe in pregnancy (59), although more
research is needed. Women who reside at higher alti-
tudes may be able to exercise safely at altitudes higher
than 6,000 feet.
In those instances in which women experience
low-back pain, exercise in water is an alternative (60).
A study of the apparent weight reduction during water
immersion in a third-trimester pregnant woman mea-
sured a mean of 82.9% of body weight, a reduction that
lowers the maternal osteoarticular load due to buoy-
ancy (61). There may be additional benefits of aquatic
exercise as well. A randomized controlled trial of an
aquatic physical exercise program during pregnancy
consisting of three 60-minute exercises demonstrated
a greater rate of intact perineum after childbirth (OR
13.54, 95% Cl, 2.75-66.56) (62).
Special Populations
Pregnant Women With Obesity
Pregnant women with obesity should be encouraged to
engage in a healthy lifestyle modification in pregnancy
that includes physical activities and judicious diets (5).
Women should start with low-intensity, short periods of
exercise and gradually increase the period or intensity of
exercise as they are able. In recent studies examining the
effects of exercise among pregnant women with obesity,
women assigned to exercise demonstrated modest reduc-
tions in weight gain and no adverse outcomes (45, 63).
Athletes
Vigorous-intensity exercise completed into the third
trimester appears to be safe for most healthy pregnancies.
Further research is needed on the effects of vigorous-
intensity exercise in the first and second trimesters and
of exercise intensity exceeding 90% of maximum heart

Committee Opinion
rate (64). Competitive athletes require frequent and close
supervision because they tend to maintain a more stren-
uous training schedule throughout pregnancy and
resume high-intensity training postpartum sooner than
other women. Such athletes should pay particular atten-
tion to avoiding hyperthermia, maintaining proper
hydration, and sustaining adequate caloric intake to pre-
vent weight loss, which may adversely affect fetal growth
An elite athlete can be defined generally as an athlete
with several years of experience in a particular sport or
sports who has competed successfully against other high
level performers and trains year-round at a high level; an
elite athlete generally trains at least 5 days per week,
averaging close to 2 hours per day throughout the year
(30). In addition to aerobic training, elite athletes in most
sports also participate in resistance training to increase
muscular strength and endurance; however, this training
was not considered a safe activity in early guidelines for
exercise during pregnancy because of potential injury
and possible fetal heart decelerations resulting from Val-
salva maneuvers. Consequently, there is sparse literature
on this topic (30). It is prudent for elite athletes who wish
to continue strenuous activity during pregnancy to have
a clear understanding of the risks, to obtain approval
from their health care providers, and to consider decreas-
ing resistance load compared with prepregnant condi-
tions. High-impact activities with increased risk of
blunt trauma should be avoided, and it also is important
that the pregnant elite athlete avoid overheating when
performing their sport or participating in intense train-
ing (30).
Activity Restriction
Several reviews have determined that there is no credible
evidence to prescribe bed rest in pregnancy for the
prevention of preterm labor, and it should not be routinely
recommended (65, 66). Patients prescribed prolonged bed
rest or restricted physical activity are at risk of venous
Exercise During Pregnancy and the Postpartum Period e183


most of the estimates of risk pointed to small or null
effects. In contrast, a cohort study of more than 62,000
Danish women reported a dose—response relationship
between total daily burden lifted and preterm birth with
loads more than 1,000 kg per day (70). In this study,
lifting heavy loads (greater than 20 kg) more than 10
times per day was associated with an increased risk of
preterm birth.
The National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health uses an equation that determines the
maximum recommended weight limit for lifting that
would be acceptable to 90% of healthy women (71).
This equation has been used to define recommended
weight limits for a broad range of lifting patterns for
pregnant women, as well as lifting conditions that pose
a higher risk of musculoskeletal injury (72) (Fig. 1).
Obstetrician—gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers can use their best clinical judgment to
determine a recommended plan for the patient. This
plan may include a formal request for an occupational
health professional to perform an analysis to deter-
mine maximum weight limits based on actual lifting
condition or assist with writing appropriate letters to
employers to help obtain accommodations (73).
Exercise in the Postpartum Period
Several reports indicate that women's level of participa-
tion in exercise programs diminishes after childbirth,
frequently leading to overweight and obesity (74, 75).
The postpartum period is an opportune time for
obstetrician—gynecologists and other obstetric care pro-
viders to recommend and reinforce a healthy lifestyle.
Resuming exercise or incorporating new exercise rou-
tines after delivery is important in supporting lifelong
healthy habits. Exercise routines may be resumed grad-
ually after pregnancy as soon as medically safe, de-
pending on the mode of delivery (vaginal or cesarean
birth) and the presence or absence of medical or surgical
complications. Some women are capable of resuming
physical activities within days of delivery. Pelvic floor
exercises can be initiated in the immediate postpartum
period. Abdominal strengthening exercises, including
abdominal crunch exercises and the drawing-in exercise,
a maneuver that increases abdominal pressure by pulling
in the abdominal wall muscles, have been shown to
decrease the incidence of diastasis recti abdominus and
decrease the inter-rectus distance in women who gave
birth vaginally or by cesarean birth (76, 77).
Regular aerobic exercise in lactating women has
been shown to improve maternal cardiovascular fitness
without affecting milk production, composition, or
infant growth (78). Women who are lactating should
consider feeding their infants or expressing milk before
exercising to avoid discomfort of engorged breasts. They
also should ensure adequate hydration before commenc-
Conclusion
Physical activity and exercise in pregnancy are associated
with minimal risks and have been shown to benefit most
women, although some modification to exercise routines
may be necessary because of normal anatomic and
physiologic changes and fetal requirements. In the
absence of obstetric or medical complications or contra-
indications, physical activity in pregnancy is safe and
desirable, and pregnant women should be encouraged to
continue or to initiate safe physical activities.
Obstetrician—gynecologists and other obstetric care
providers should evaluate women with medical or
obstetric complications carefully before making recom-
mendations on physical activity participation during
pregnancy. Although the evidence is limited, exercise
results in benefits to pregnancy outcomes, and there is no
evidence of harm when exercise is not contraindicated.
Physical activity and exercise during pregnancy promote
physical fitness and may prevent excessive gestational
weight gain. Exercise may reduce the risk of gestational
diabetes, preeclampsia, and cesarean birth. Additional
research is needed to study the effects of exercise on
pregnancy-specific conditions and outcomes and to clar-
ify further effective behavioral counseling methods and
the optimal type, frequency, and intensity of exercise.
Similar research is needed to create an improved evi-
dence base concerning the effects of occupational phys-
ical activity on maternal—fetal health.

Background: Being obese can lead to various complications during pregnancy, such as Gestational Diabetes Mellitus
(GDM), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), Pre-Eclampsia (PE), and Large Gestational Age (LGA). Although bariatric
surgery is an effective way to treat obesity, it can also result in complications and may be linked to having small for
gestational age (SGA) babies. This cohort study protocol aims to compare the maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes of two
groups of Iranian pregnant women: those who have undergone bariatric surgery and those who are obese but have not had
bariatric surgery. Methods: In this study Pregnant women (< 14 weeks' gestation) (n = 38 per group) are recruited either
from one of the obesity clinic (exposure group = with a history of bariatric surgery) or primary healthcare clinics in Tehran
city (comparison group = pregnant women with obesity and and no history of bariatric surgery). Dietary intake and nutrient
status are assessed at < 14, 28, and 36 weeks. Maternal and fetal/neonatal outcomes are compared between the two
groups, including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm labor, intrauterine growth restriction, severe nausea and
vomiting, abortion, placenta previa and abruption, venous thrombosis, vaginal bleeding, cesarean delivery, meconium
aspiration, and respiratory distress. Maternal serum levels of ferritin, albumin, zinc, calcium, magnesium, selenium, copper,
vitamins A, B9, B12, and 25-hydroxy Vit D are checked during 24th to 28th weeks. Maternal and neonatal outcomes,
including height, weight, head circumference, fetal abnormality, infection, small or large fetus, low birth weight, macrosomia,
NICU admission, and total weight gain during pregnancy, are measured at birth. Maternal and offspring outcomes, including
weight, height, head circumference, total weight gain during pregnancy, newborn diseases, postpartum bleeding,
breastfeeding, and related problems, are assessed 6 weeks after delivery. Child's weight, height, and head circumference
are followed at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 months after birth. Maternal stress, anxiety, and depression are assessed with the
DASS-21 questionnaire, and physical activity is evaluated using the PPAQ questionnaire in the first and third trimesters.
Discussion: By assessing the levels of micronutrients in the blood of pregnant women along with the evaluation of
pregnancy outcomes, it is feasible to gain a more accurate understanding of how bariatric surgery affects the health and
potential complications for both the mother and the fetus/newborn. This information can help specialists and patients make
more informed decisions about the surgery. Additionally, by examining issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression in
women undergoing surgery, this study can contribute to recognizing these problems, which can also affect pregnancy
outcomes. 0 2024, The Author(s).

Abstract—This study is aimed at providing companies with de-
cision support in selecting the most suitable production processes
for producing diverse customized products belonging to a family,
in attempting to achieve production efficiency while utilizing the
available manufacturing resources. One of the measurements of
' 'best suitability" is the similarity of production processes for
producing product family members. If the production processes
are similar, there will be fewer production changeovers. This, in
turn, helps achieve not only efficiency but also product quality.
We develop an integer linear formulation for the selection of
production routings for each member of a product family, and
for the assignment of an execution mode to each operation in
each selected routing. We report on computational experiments
with an illustrative example instance.
Index Terms—process family planning, product family, opti-
mization, integer programming, routing similarity, production
processes.
I. INTRODUCTION
The objective of this paper is to formulate a mathematical
model that determines an optimal production process for a
customized product belonging to a family (i.e., process family
planning [3]). In this regard, both representation as well as
selection of alternative production processes are required. The
output includes specific operations (or operations modes) and
their precedence relationships (i.e., operations precedence), the
total processing time, and the total production cost.
In practice, for producing a product, a routing consists of
a number of operations and operations precedence. It can
be implemented by a number of production process alter-
natives, each of which is formed by operations modes and
the corresponding operations precedence. Companies typically
adopt only one production process to produce each product,
in the hope of reducing the difficulties and complexities
in production on the shop floors [l], [5]. Different modes
of a same operation may differ in manufacturing resources
(such as machines, tools, fixtures), thus leading to different
processing times and costs. In process family planning, all the
production process alternatives for a given customized product
are compared with the production process being used on the
shop floor for producing other customized products belonging
to the same family. In accordance with the differences in
routings and manufacturing resources, production processes
are compared with respect to the routing and manufactur-
ing resource similarities. That is, the total similarity of two
production processes includes the weighted routing similarity
and manufacturing resource similarity. The higher the total
similarity between a production process alternative and the
existing one, the fewer production changeovers will be needed,
which, in turn, contributes to production stability, reduced
production cost, and product quality [4].
The total production cost is the total cost for producing
the given customized product using the selected production
process. Since the cost for each operations mode is known,
the total production cost is the sum of the costs of operations
modes, which form the selected production process. The total
processing time is obtained as the maximum length (duration)
of any sequence of operations that cannot be processed in
parallel. According to the above, the objective has three
parts: to maximize production similarity, to minimize total
production cost, and to minimize total processing time.
II. OPTIMIZATION
A. Definitions
We consider the following definitions:
Rpt
= set of products,
= set of operations,
= i-th alternative routing for product p G P; a
partially ordered set (Qpi Api) with Qpi C Q and
binary relation Api C Qpi x Qpi transitive and
irreflexive, and
= the set of all alternative routings RPi for product p.
Each operations precedence set Api is such that (WI , w2) G A
if and only if the output of WI belongs to the input set of
w2. In this paper, we work with hierarchical BOM structures,
where each operation only has one output (as opposed to flat
or inverse BOMs, which may have more than one identical
or distinct outputs). Each routing has one unique end product,
which is the (unique) output component p G P of the unique
maximal element of (Q A O. Consequently, each graph
G(Qpi Api) is an in-tree. We also assume that each operation
appears at most once in each routing.
The routing similarity for two routings RPi Rqj for two
different products p, q is defined as follows:
2 X I Api Aqjl
RS(Rpz, Rqj) —
I Apil + I Aqjl

In Figure 1, for instance, if operation b is the same as 2 and
c is the same as 3, assuming that b and 2 produce the same
output from the same material input (and similarly for c and
3), then RS(r1, 1*2) ¯
50%. Clearly, an RS score is always
in the interval [0%, 100%], and equals 100% if Apt A q,
We also consider a set of 'modes' M(w) for each w G Q.
Each mode m G M(w) has an associated cost cw
and an
associated duration dam. For a given operations set Qpi C Q, a
process (alternative) is a mapping of each operation w G
to a mode 7T(w) G M(w). Each mode corresponds to a
selection of a set of manufacturing resources to perform the
operation in question. The manufacturing resource similarity
between two different products p, q with mode assignment np,
respectively T q, reflects the proportion of identical modes (for
identical operations) in the two production processes. More

2 X G Opi n Qqj : 7rp(w)
In Figure 2, for instance, if a and A represent the same opera-
tions mode, and b and B are also the same, the manufacturing
similarity of the two production processes is 50%.
B. Problem statement and a linear model
Our goal is to select a set of production processes, each
of which is formed by specific operations modes and their
operations precedence, to produce a given set of products
such that an optimal performance with respect to production
similarity, total production cost, and total processing time can
be achieved. These three objectives (similarity, cost, and time)
may conflict with one another. Thus, we include a composite
similarity measure in the objective and relegate cost and time
to the constraints, where we impose an upper bound Cp and
Tp on the total cost, respectively time, for product p.
The problem to be solved can be captured by a linear model
with the following two sets of decision variables:
xpz G {0, 1}; xpz
1 iff routing Rpt is chosen for
product p, and
1 iff operation w for product p is
executed in mode m, so if arp(w) m.
We also use the following additional parameters in the model:
Q(p) C Q is the subset of operations that occur in at least
one routing for product p,
1 iff operation w appears in
routing i for product p,
1 iff operation w can be per-
pzwm
pawm
formed in mode m in routing i for product p, and
L(p, i) C 20pi is the set of operation sets that corre-
spond with an inclusion-maximal path in graph
Consequently, öpiw =
1 iff there is at least one mode m such
that ö*

The following constraint applies:
iGRp
(1)
where 'i G Rp' stands for Rpt G Rp. This constraint implies
that exactly one routing will be chosen for each product.
If a routing Rpt is selected (x pi = 1) such that Ypwm cannot
equal 1, namely if ö*
0, we need to enforce value 0 upon
pzwm
the corresponding Y variable:

We also impose that exactly one mode be chosen for each
operation in the routing selected for product p, as follows:
VpeP,Vw Q(p). (3)
This constraint also ensures that no mode is selected if w does
not appear in the selected routing.
The upper limits on the total cost and total duration for each
product can be imposed with the following constraints:

tree, the cardinality of L(p, i) is O(Qpi).

In this expression, the term RS(Rpz Rqj) is independent of X

of the routing and the manufacturing similarity, respectively.
In this paper, for illustrative simplicity, these weights are
set as 50% each. In practice, companies can decide on the
values of these two weights based on their own production
characteristics.
C. Complexity analysis
Consider the following decision problem:
EVEN-ODD PARTITION
Instance: A finite set A = {
} and a size

s(a) G N for each a G A
Question: Is there a subset N C A such that s(a) —
s(a) and A' contains exactly one of (ly—I, am for
aGA\A'
This problem is known to be NP-complete [2]. It can be shown
that the feasibility question for the optimization problem
defined in Section II-B is also NP-complete. For a given
instance of EVEN-ODD PARTITION, consider a single prod-
uct p with only one routing (IRpl 1), such that IQp11 n
and (Qpl, Apl) is a complete order on QPI (the precedence
graph is one chain of n operations). Each operation Wi

be verified that a feasible mode assignment for the thus
constructed instance exists with C B and Tp
if and only if the answer to the corresponding PARTITION
instance is yes.
This complexity result implies that a polynomial-time algo-
rithm for solving the problem does not exist unless P = NP,
which is generally assumed to be very unlikely. We therefore
solve the integer linear formulation developed supra by means
of a mainstream linear solver.
III. NUMERICAL EXAMPLE AND DISCUSSION
We consider a numerical example where a product family
consists of three product variants, P P3}. The
maximal allowable cost and time for producing each product
variant are as follows: Cl 45, Tl 30, (32 35, 172 45,
C3 46 and T3 = 40. Each product variant has two routing
alternatives; the routing sets for each product variant are de-
noted by Rp {RPI, Rp2}, for p 1, 2, 3. The routing graphs
G(Qpi Api) are included in Appendix A. The set of operations
for producing the product family includes 32 operations in
total, some of which are the same. Most operations can be
implemented by different sets of manufacturing resources,
leading to specific operations modes, and the corresponding
durations and costs. Some modes for identical operations for
different products are also the same. Further details are given
in the appendix.
The linear formulation contains 246 variables (all binary)
in total for the example instance, and 350 constraints. It was
solved by Gurobi Solver 5.6.2, called from Python 2.7.6.
The experiment was run on a Dell OptiPlex 7010 with an
Intel Core i7-3770 processor and 8 GB of RAM, running
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. The instance was solved in less than
0.01 seconds; this indicates that the runtime for any instance
of comparable size will be negligible. The optimal production
similarity equals 93.58%. With the current values for Cp and
Tp, none of the budget and time constraints (4) and (5) is
binding, so the optimal objective value would equal 93.58%
even if constraints (4)—(5) were simply removed.
Figure 3 examines the optimal production similarity for the
example instance as a function of the upper bounds on cost
and time. In detail, the right-hand sides of the constraints
for all three products in Equation (4), respectively (5), are
simultaneously decreased by the value on the horizontal axis
in the plot in Figure 3a, respectively Figure 3b. We observe
that the optimal production similarity remains constant until
one of the constraints (4) becomes binding, after which there is
a steady decrease until the constraints become too restrictive
to admit a feasible solution (which is where the plots end).
The plot for the durations displays a similar pattern. This
implies that restrictive budgets and limits on processing times

may launch product family members one by one. In the future,
therefore, we intend to extend the model by taking into account
this situation. From a more theoretical point of view, we have
only shown NP-hardness in the ordinary sense, although we
suspect that the problem can also be shown to be strongly
NP-hard. In this regard, showing either strong NP-hardness or
developing a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm is a subject
for future work as well. Finally, due to the complexity status
of the problem, when the instances to be solved are of larger
size then it may be necessary to resort to heuristic procedures
(e.g., metaheuristics) to produce high-quality solutions within
reasonable runtimes.

I V. CONCLUSION
This paper has introduced an optimization model to as-
sist companies in planning production processes for diverse
customized products such that production efficiency can be
achieved by maintaining production as stable as possible.
We have considered not only routing and manufacturing
resource similarities, but also production time and cost. The
optimization problem at hand turns out to be NP-hard, and
we have therefore employed a commercial solver to solve a
linear formulation of the problem. We have reported our results
for a numerical example, which demonstrates that our model
can provide decision-making support in planning production
processes for product families.
The optimization model has been developed by considering
the situation where all customized products belonging to a
family are launched at the same time. In practice, companies

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective: This short communication demonstrates how short tandem repeat genotyping can identify
the origin of gestational choriocarcinoma.
Materials and methods: The origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in our three cases was determined
using the short tandem repeats genotyping technique, which involved quantitative fluorescent PCR and
fragmentation analysis.
Results: In Case 1 despite no medical history of molar pregnancy, DNA analysis indicated that the
choriocarcinoma originated from a homozygous complete hydatidiform mole. We conclude, that the
patient's complete abortion 10 years prior to the choriocarcinoma diagnosis was an undiagnosed com-
plete hydatidiform mole. In Case 2 and Case 3 the clinically presumed origin of choriocarcinoma was
confirmed.
Conclusion: Determining the origin of choriocarcinoma is essential for clinical application, as it affects
the FIGO scoring system for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, which determines the patient's prog-
nosis and treatment approach.

Gestational choriocarcinoma is a rare, aggressive malignancy
with high metastatic potential. Its origin is linked to previous
pregnancies: approximately 50 % of cases originate from molar
pregnancies, 25 % from abortion or ectopic pregnancy, and 25 %
from births [1—3]. While the antecedent pregnancy was tradition-
ally assumed to be the origin of gestational choriocarcinoma, mo-
lecular genetic studies have shown that this is not always true [4 5

Determining the origin of the malignancy is essential for clinical
application, as it affects the FIGO scoring system for gestational
trophoblastic neoplasia, which determines the patient's prognosis
and treatment approach (Supplemental Table). Patients with lower
scores (6 or less) are considered low-risk and treated with mono-
chemotherapy, while those with higher scores (more than 6) are
considered high-risk and require polychemotherapy. A patient who
had an abortion 2 years ago and a birth 3 months ago and develops
gestational choriocarcinoma will receive a score of 5 or 2 based on
the "Antecedent pregnancy" and "Interval months from end of in-
dex pregnancy to treatment" criteria, depending on the causative
pregnancy of the tumor 16]. Molecular diagnostics can also distin-
guish between metastases of gestational choriocarcinoma and non-
gestational choriocarcinoma, a germ cell tumor that has similar
characteristics but is less responsive to chemotherapy and requires
distinct management [4]. In this report, we present three cases of
choriocarcinoma to emphasize the importance of determining the
origin of the malignancy in determining the patient's prognostic
score and subsequent treatment. Overall, the mortality rate for

choriocarcinoma is currently low because of its high chemo-
sensitivity [11.
Materials and methods
The origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in our three cases was
determined using the Short Tandem Repeats (STR) genotyping
technique, which involved Quantitative Fluorescent PCR (QF-PCR)
and fragmentation analysis. Blood, saliva, and tissues from paraffin
blocks were used for DNA isolation with QIAGEN kits. QF-PCR was
performed using the GenePrint 10 System (Promega) and Devyser
Extend v2 (Devyser) commercial kits. Capillary electrophoresis was
performed on ABI Prism 3130XL and ABI Prism 310 Genetic
Analyzer. The recommended DNA concentration in reaction of
samples isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue
were adjusted (increased) because of poor quality of DNA and
fragmentation. The GeneMapperTM Software v4.1 was used to
analyze the data.
To interpret the obtained data, two main tasks need to be per-
formed. First, the genome composition needs to be determined by
Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology 63 (2024) 73-76
comparing the STR allelic profiles of the choriocarcinoma and the
patient, which allows the identification of the type of pregnancy
that gave rise to the cancer. Abnormal genome compositions are
characteristic of molar pregnancies, with complete hydatidiform
moles typically having two sets of paternal chromosomes (Fig. la
and c) and partial hydatidiform moles having two sets of paternal
and one set of maternal chromosomes. However, biparental com-
plete hydatidiform mole can have a physiological genome compo-
sition, which is a potential pitfall. Non-gestational choriocarcinoma
lacks identifiable paternal allelic sets (Table 1)
Matching the choriocarcinoma with a specific pregnancy based
on genetic analysis is important for determining both the type of
pregnancy that gave rise to the tumor and the time interval be-
tween the end of the index pregnancy and treatment (as illustrated
b and c).

In this context - because gestational choriocarcinoma originates from a product of conception - alleles not present in the patient (mother) are evaluated as paternal (nonmaternal).
a) Gestational choriocarcinoma originating from monospermic (homozygous) androgenetic complete hydatidiform mole: Electrophoretograms of the patient (DNA isolated from
unfixed fresh frozen myometrium) and the choriocarcinoma (ChCa — DNA isolated from unfixed fresh frozen tumor). Asterisks indicate alleles of loci proving the absence of
maternal chromosomes in the nuclear genome of the tumor. All loci of the choriocarcinoma contain only one STR allele what suggest monospermic complete mole.
b) Gestational choriocarcinoma originating from a pregnancy ended up with birth: Electrophoretograms of the patient (DNA isolated from peripheral blood), the choriocarcinoma
(ChCa — DNA isolated from paraffine block) and the infant (DNA isolated from saliva). STR allelic profiles of the choriocarcinoma and the infant are identical proving the origin of the
tumor. In the tumor tissue, characteristic vascular space invasion and necrosis can lead to a certain amount of contamination with maternal blood what can be seen on electro-
phoretograms as minor maternal spikes. Taken together with the DNA fragmentation caused by formalin fixation, allelic imbalances may occur.
c) Gestational choriocarcinoma originating from dispermic (heterozygous) androgenetic complete hydatidiform mole: Electrophoretograms of the patient (DNA isolated from
peripheral blood), the complete hydatidiform mole (CHM — DNA isolated from microdissection of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded chorionic villi) and the vaginal excision with
the metastasis of gestational choriocarcinoma (Mts — isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue). Asterisks indicate alleles of loci proving the absence of maternal
chromosomes in the nuclear genome of the mole. Loci of the mole contain two different paternal allelic sets suggesting dispermic complete mole. In the mole, the 1 : 1 ratio of the X
and Y alleles of the Amelogenin (AMEL) locus points out, that the gonosomal complement is most probably XY, but XXYY cannot be excluded. In the VWA locus of the mole (CHM),
the same allele was in both copies inherited from the father. This can be the result of either the homozygosity of the father for this concrete allele or the same allele was inherited
from both sperms. The metastasis (Mts) specimen represents a mixture of tumor cells and the healthy cells of the patient, because tumor cells invaded the surrounding tissues
extensively.

the patients are as follows.
Case 1
A 56-year-old patient - G3/P1 with a history of an incomplete
abortion 27 years ago, a live birth 18 years ago, and a complete
miscarriage 10 years ago, presented with heavy bleeding after 4
months of amenorrhea. A choriocarcinoma was detected from a
curettage specimen, and further investigation revealed a 7 cm tu-
mor in the myometrium, suggesting choriocarcinoma. The patient
underwent a hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,
and DNA was isolated from the unfixed tissue of the myometrium
and the tumor. DNA analysis showed that the tumor - choriocar-
cinoma had an androgenetic composition of the genome, was ho-
mozygous in all examined loci, and had a gonosome complement
XX, indicating that it originated from a homozygous (mono-
spermic) complete hydatidiform mole. The patient's complete
abortion 10 years prior to the choriocarcinoma diagnosis was found
to be an undiagnosed complete hydatidiform mole with a long
interval to malignant transformation (
a). However, histo-
Fig. 1
pathological examination was not performed for the third preg-
nancy, and serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels were not
monitored.
Case 2
A 29-year-old patient - GI/PI presented with bleeding two
months after giving birth to a live born boy. Curettage was per-
formed, and gestational choriocarcinoma was detected based on
ultrasound suspicion and histopathology. DNA was extracted from
the patient's peripheral blood, microdissected formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, and the infant's saliva. DNA anal-
ysis revealed a biparental genome composition of the tumor, and
identical STR allelic profiles in the tumor and infant, confirming the
origin of gestational choriocarcinoma in the pregnancy ended up
with birth of a live born boy (Fig. 1b)
Case 3
A 21 -year-old patient - G2/P1 developed a bleeding vaginal
metastasis from gestational choriocarcinoma two weeks after the
evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole. DNA was extracted
from the patient's peripheral blood, formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded chorionic villi of the complete hydatidiform mole, and
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded vaginal excision with metastatic
choriocarcinoma (confirmed by histology). According to DNA
Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology 63 (2024) 73-76
analysis, the complete hydatidiform mole was proved to be dis-
permic with gonosomal complement X Y. In the vaginal excision
with the metastasis of choriocarcinoma mixed STR alleles of the
mole and the patient were detected proving the origin of gesta-
tional choriocarcinoma in the above-mentioned mole (Fig. lc)
Discussion
STR genotyping can provide clinically significant information for
gestational choriocarcinoma cases.
Genetic analysis revealed misdiagnosed complete hydatidiform
mole in Case 1. The patient got 1 point less in the FIGO scoring
system (Supplemental Table) what did not change the stratification
of the patient in this particular case, she stayed in the high-risk
group.
In Case 2, the gestational choriocarcinoma originated from a
term birth, and genetic analysis was crucial in excluding any un-
recognized pregnancies. In Case 3, a metastatic gestational
choriocarcinoma developed just two weeks after the evacuation
because of the malignant transformation of a dispermic complete
hydatidiform mole, highlighting the highly aggressive nature of
these lesions.
According to a study recently published by Jung et al., copy-
neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (CN-LOH) and copy number al-
terations (CNAs) are key molecular characteristics in gestational
choriocarcinomas arising from complete hydatidiform moles [5].
CN-LOH occurs in homozygous (monospermic) complete hyda-
tidiform moles on a whole genome level because of the dupli-
cation of a haploid set of chromosomes in one sperm, like in our
Case 1. The CN-LOH pattern seen in heterozygous (dispermic)
complete hydatidiform moles is typically segmental, what is
attributable to two independent meiotic events of the two
sperms fertilizing the ovum, like in our Case 3. According to the
above mentioned study, malignant transformation of complete
moles into choriocarcinoma may happen by the accumulation of
CNAs
Using STR genotyping is possible to differentiate between
monospermic (homozygous) and dispermic (heterozygous) com-
plete moles. Finding out whether the complete mole is heterozy-
gous or homozygous in clinical practice only points to a higher risk
of malignancy in the case of a heterozygous complete mole but
does not predict malignancy. The close follow-up of the hCG tumor
marker and the patient's clinical condition remains crucial [7].
According to the FIGO scoring system, the source of choriocar-
cinoma is the antecedent (last) pregnancy. DNA analysis can reveal
that this was not the case, and that the choriocarcinoma did not
come from the last pregnancy, but from the previous one. This can
change the scoring system - the number of points not only for the
pregnancy preceding choriocarcinoma, but also for the interval from
the antecedent pregnancy. Ultimately, this can change the patient
stratification from low risk to high risk or vice versa, which also
changes the chemotherapeutic approach (monochemotherapy/
polychemotherapy).
In summary, STR genotyping is an efficient and accurate method
for identifying the origin of both gestational and non-gestational
choriocarcinoma. Fresh frozen tissue is the preferred sample type,
but formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples are also acceptable.
The genotypes of the patient, tumor, and previous pregnancies are
compared to determine the type and time interval from the end of
the index pregnancy, both of which are important for prognosis and
treatment. It's worth noting that the last pregnancy may not always
be the source of gestational choriocarcinoma, and occult, non-
diagnosed molar/nonmolar pregnancies can also contribute to
this malignancy. According to our experiences, the described
molecular diagnostic method is economically manageable (costs

approximately as other standard laboratory diagnostic methods in
Slovakia). In clinical practice, identifying the origin of choriocarci-
noma can change the FIGO score and optimize the chemotherapy
regimen.

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objectives: Family planning is a cornerstone to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. How-
ever, men's involvement in family planning has been a challenge in many countries. This study aimed to
investigate the participation of men in the family planning programs and related factors from the per-
spective of women referring to family planning organizations in Herat, Afghanistan 2021.
Methods: The study had a cross-sectional design. The participants of the study consisted of 544 married
women aged 15-49 years selected by simple random sampling. The data collection tool was a valid and
reliable questionnaire to assess the participation of men in family planning programs. To analyze the data,
descriptive statistics and analytical methods including Mann-Whitney and Pearson Chi-Square tests were
applied in SPSS 21. The answers to the open-end questions were analyzed, coded and classified in two
main categories.
Results: The average age of study participants was years and a significant proportion of them
were illiterate (48.5%). Most of the participants were housewives (83.6%) and their husbands were non-
professional workers (39.9%). The husbands participated in family planning programs by choosing the
type of contraception (29.2%), provision of contraceptives (29.6%) and supporting their wives using them
(49.3%). There were statistically significant relationships between women's and their husband's education
level, and husband's employment status with the type of participation in family planning. The main in-
centives for Afghan men to participate family planning were the increased attention of families to the
education and needs of children and the health and welfare of the wives. However, cultural norms sup-
porting larger families, the desire for having boy children, the fear of contraception's side effects and
religious prohibitions discourage them in using family planning methods.
Conclusion: A large number of the respondents stated that their spouse participated in family planning
programs. It shows the importance and success of family planning centers in promoting sexual and re-
productive health and family planning. Study showed that various factors affected men's participation in
family planning programs. Recognition of these factors can help policy makers in designing behavioral
interventions based on social marketing, and enhancing the effectiveness of these programs.
One of the most important areas of population policies is hu-
man reproduction. Family planning has been a part of most socio-
economic development plans around the world in recent years
(Keshavarz et al., 2014). It has been used by policy makers in mak-
ing a balance between population
size and development require-

ments. Hence, family planning has other advantages that should
not be overlooked. It improves the health of mothers and children
and prevents the transmission of Sexually Transmitted Diseases
(STDs). Several international human rights and health treaties in-
cluding the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cul-
tural Rights 1966, the Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989
and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrim-
ination against Women 1979 addressed family planning and the
right to sexual and reproductive health. Sexual health is "a state
of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to
sexuality" and reproductive health means "the capability to repro-

cisions" (
). Family planning helps people to make in-

formed choices about the number of children and the timing and
spacing of pregnancies. They help preventing unintended pregnan-
Cies and the need for abortion (WHO 2018)
The International Conference on Population and Development
(Cairo 1994) addressed this important issue. According to this con-
ference, sexual and reproductive health programs should have a
couple-oriented approach and not only focus on women, but also
persuade men to fulfill their responsibilities. Men, by having im-
portant roles in the family and society, can be the determinants
of family planning programs' success (Simbar, 2012) and helpful
in the promotion of women and children's health (Simbar et al.,
). In this conference, the concept of men's participation was
2009
defined as supporting the wife in receiving pregnancy care, fam-
ily planning and preserving sexual and reproductive health. In fact,
the participation of men means fulfilling their responsibilities in
supporting the spouse to deal with the diffculties of sexual life,
childbearing and choosing and using contraception methods (WHO
). So far, most family planning activities and studies have fo-
2002
cused on women and little attention has been paid to the role of
men (
Chigozie and Messias, 2019, Davis et al., 2016)
Afghanistan is located within South and Central Asia. With per
capita GDP of 1971$, this country is ranked as a low income
country (World Bank 2020a). Annual population growth rate of
Afghanistan was 2.3% in 2020 (Wold Bank 2020b). The effective
and successful implementation of family planning programs can
play an important role in the country's sustainable development
(Starbird et al., 2016), and as mentioned, this will not happen with-
out the participation of men and women. Studying men's partici-
pation and related factors is essential for planning and implement-
ing interventions to improve the level and quality of participation.
Considering the cultural context of Afghanistan and the predomi-
nance of men's decisions in the family, and the fact that according
to the Afghanistan's law, polygamy is allowed (Monsutti, 2007) It
is especially important to involve them in the use of contraceptive
methods. According to Shafiqollah et al, the awareness of Afghans
about contraceptive methods is satisfactory, but the contraceptive
prevalence is low (Shafiqullah et al., 2018). There is a knowledge
gap about men's participation in family planning programs in this
country. The purpose of this study was to investigate the partici-
pation of men in family planning programs from the perspective of
women in Afghanistan.
Methods
This study has a cross-sectional design. The study population
included married women aged 15-49 years who referred to the
clinics of Marie Stopes Institute in Herat city of Afghanistan in
2021. Herat is the capital city of Herat province, located in the west
of Afghanistan. With a population of 272806 people in 2021, this
city was the fourth populated city in Afghanistan (World Popula-
tion Review, 2021). Marie Stopes is a foreign NGO, providing fam-
ily planning and contraceptive services in Afghanistan. It has two
clinics in Herat. The population of the city has acceptable access to
these two clinics (
Zwi et al., 2015).
Based on the following formula, due to the lack of similar stud-
ies regarding the participation rate of men in the family planning
program in Afghanistan, the participation rate (p) of 50% has been
taken into account, which by considering the first type error (a) of
5%, the power of the test (1-ß) as 80% and the accuracy (d) as 6%,
the sample size was estimated to be 550.

Considering that the number of referrals to two clinics of Marie
Stopes Institute was almost equal, the sample 275) was se-
lected equally from each clinic. Sampling was done in four differ-
ent weeks in four different months. It was performed in all days
of each week, and in three different times per day including early
working hours of the clinics (3 samples), mid-hours (5 samples)
and the end of working hours (3 samples). Each time, samples
were selected randomly, according to the order of their arrival at
the clinic.
To collect data, a questionnaire which had been made and used
in a similar study by Pouransary et al. was used (Pouransary et al.,
). The mentioned study aimed to determine the use of differ-
2008
ent methods of contraception among women of Iranshahr, a dis-
trict in southeast of Iran (near the border of Iran-Afghanistan) and
the rate of their husbands' participation in family planning. The
validity of the questionnaire was confirmed according to the opin-
ions of 8 experts (by calculating the content validity ratio (CVR)).
The reliability of the questionnaire was examined by the test-retest
method in a pilot study on 20 samples with a 2-week interval be-
tween the two tests. According to the calculated intraclass corre-
lation coeffcient (ICC) of 0.91, the reliability of the questionnaire
was confirmed (Pouransary et al., 2008). Because the offcial lan-
guage of both countries, Iran and Afghanistan, was the same, there
was no need for translating the questionnaire, and only terminol-
ogy edit was done by a person who was familiar with two dialects
of Persian (Farsi and Dari). However, in order to ensure the con-
tent validity of the questionnaire in the context of Afghanistan, the
questionnaire was assessed and approved by a number of Afghan
experts in reproductive health and family planning programs.
The questionnaire consisted of three parts. In the first part, de-
mographic characteristics of the women participating in the study
and their spouses were asked. The second part consisted of two
questions. In the first question, each participant was asked about
the status of her spouse's participation in family planning in the
form of a four-choice question: 1- Lack of any cooperation, 2- Se-
lection and cooperation in choosing the method of contraception,
3- Preparation of contraceptives, 4- Supporting and reminding the
correct and effective use of the method. In this case, the respon-
dents could choose more than one answer. In the second question,
the participants were asked to indicate their satisfaction with the
contraception method in a four-choice Likert scale (very satisfied=
5, relatively satisfied= 4, neither agree nor disagree = 3, relatively
dissatisfied= 2, and dissatisfied= 1). The third part of the ques-
tionnaire was about what encourages and discourages Afghan men
to participate in family planning.
To analyze the data, descriptive statistical methods including
percentage and mean as well as analytical methods including
Mann-Whitney and Pearson Chi-square tests were used. Data anal-
ysis was performed using SPSS software version 21. Moreover, the
answers to open-end questions were analyzed, coded and classified
in two main categories.
Results
In the study of Afghan men's participation in family planning
programs from the perceptive of their wives, response rate was
98.9% (n=544). Demographic characteristics of participants and
their spouses are shown in Table 1. According to this table, spouses
were on average 6 years older than their wives. Nearly half of par-
ticipants were illiterate. The proportion of spouses with academic
degrees was about twice that of female participants. On average,
men were more educated than women.
Frequency distribution of different types of men's participation
in family planning programs is presented in Table 2. As shown in
this table, only seven percent of participants reported that their
spouses did not have any kind of participation in family plan-

types of participation, and "preparing the contraception" was the
least frequent type.
Results of the relationship test between the status of hus-
bands' participation and demographic variables are presented in
Table 3.
According to this table, the mean age of respondents
whose spouses did not participate in family programs was sig-
nificantly (p<O.001) higher than the age of respondents whose
spouses participated. In addition, the mean age of not participat-
ing spouses in family programs was significantly (p<0.001) higher
than the age of those who participated. Household's income of re-
spondents whose spouses did not participate in family programs
was significantly (p<0.05) lower than the other group. Also, the
number of children in families that spouses did not participate
Table 3
in family planning was significantly (p<0.001) higher than that of
participants whose spouses participated.
Results of Table 3
indicates a significant difference between the
respondents' level of education and male participation in family
planning programs. The ratio of participation among spouses of
those who had high school or academic education was higher than
other groups (illiterate or primary school education); this pattern
was also observed in studying the relationship between the sta-
tus of spouses' participation and their level of education. The ratio
of participation among spouses who had high levels of education
(high school or academic) was greater than illiterate spouses or the
ones with primary school education.
The average score of the satisfaction with the contraception
method used was 1.42 ±0.66. Ninety-four percent (n=403) of par-
ticipants declared that they were very or relatively satisfied with
the contraception method used. Only 6 percent (n=26) were dis-
satisfied in some ways.
Results of the test of relationship between participation types
and the satisfaction of the wives with the contraception method
used is presented in Table 4. According to this table, respondents
whose spouses participated in family planning program were sig-
nificantly (p<O.001) more satisfied than those whose spouses did
not participate. Also, there was a significant (p<0.001) relationship
between "supporting and reminding the use of contraceptives"

with satisfaction. Participants whose spouses supported them were
more satisfied with the contraception method used.
The main incentives for Afghan men to participate family plan-
ning were the increased attention of families to the education and
needs of children and the health and welfare of their wives. How-
ever, cultural norms supporting larger families, the desire for hav-
ing boy children, the fear of contraception's side effects and reli-
gious prohibitions discourage them in using FP (Table 5).
Discussion
About 20% of Afghan women use contraceptives according to
the report of UNFPA Afghanistan. In this country, women should
ask the permission of their husbands to use contraceptives that
shows the important role of Afghan men in family planning
). Studies show that the success of family planning is
UNFPA 2022
dependent to the involvement of men and women (Berhane et al.,
2011). However, in less developed countries, husband's participa-
tion in family planning is low and men consider it a women's is-
sue. A study in Malawi indicated that targeting men in family plan-
ning programs resulted in considerable increase of contraceptive
use (Shattuck et al., 2011).
Table 5
Factors that encourage or discourage the participation of Afghan men in family planning.
Midwifery 117 (2023) 103575
The present study indicates that men had interest in participat-
ing in family planning programs in Afghanistan as more than 95%
of women declared it. Considering the low level of contraceptive
use in this country, the findings of the study show the importance
and success of family planning centers in promoting sexual and
reproductive health and family planning. A study in Jordan 2012
showed that although more than 90% of studied men knew about
family planning, 45% reported that they used contraceptives. More-
over, 90% believed that both husband and wife should decide about
family planning (Mansour et al., 2016). In Kenya, 58% of men, in
Nigeria 43% and in Senegal 27% reported to be using modern con-
traceptives (Okigbo et al., 2015). Study by Nurfaizah et al. demon-
strated that male participation in family planning was low in In-
donesia. Moreover, men's knowledge of family planning and repro-
ductive health, social values, culture and attitudes affected their
participation in family planning. For the implementation of FP pro-
grams, they suggested that communication, education and cooper-
ation of religious leaders and stakeholders and public and private
sector authorities were essential (Nurfaizah et al., 2016
In our study that focuses on the couples referring to special
health facilities designated for providing family planning services,
a large number of men supported their wives to use family plan-
ning, however, not all of them were willing to buy contraceptives.
This might be related to the cultural factors e.g., men are dissuad-
ing to seek information on family planning and reproductive and
sexual health (UNFPA 2022). In Iran, men usually make decisions
on using family planning and type of contraception for the couple
(Nabavi et al., 2009). Their participation in family planning pro-
grams differs across the country. In a study in Iran, men reported
the fear of side effects of contraceptives, and one third of them
showed the sense of male domination and behavior based on tra-
ditional stereotypes of gender roles (Ghiasi and Karimi, 2009)
In a study in Malawi, socio-economic factors were recognized as
influential in men's involvement in FP. Accessibility of the methods
and affordability of contraceptives were influenced by those fac-
tors (
Dral et al., 2018). These findings are in line with the present
study that showed people having higher income and education in-

My husband and I are not sure about the future. I
am afraid to send my children to school because of
insecurity and conflict in the country.
In current economic situation, large families have
difficulties to meet their children needs. They
cannot afford sending their children particularly the
girls to school; they choose to marry off them in a
young age.
I want to continue my education and my husband
agrees with me to postpone pregnancy.
Family planning services are mostly provided in
women's section in hospitals that men are not
allowed to enter. Moreover, midwives and female
doctors are not allowed to provide family planning
counselling to men. They give information to
women and they share it with their husbands.
Contraceptives are harmful for our health
My husband likes to have 4 boys and 3 girls.
My husband agreed birth spacing but we think
permanent sterilization is a sin.
They think Allah is the determinant of child bearing
and people should not interfere in his decision.

volved more in FP. Oyediran et al. found that the age and edu-
cation of the husbands, number of living children, and receiving
information from family planning providers were the principal de-
terminants of men's involvement (Oyediran et al., 2012). All these
factors had statistically significant relationships with male partici-
pation in our study too. Kamal et al. studied the factors influencing
men involvement in FP in Bangladesh and found that male involve-
ment was 63.2 percent in the studied area and women's level of
education had a direct effect on FP use that supports the finding
of our study (Kamal et al., 2013). In Kamal et al. study, as couple
aged, the use of contraceptives increased but the present study re-
vealed an opposite situation since younger couples intended to use
contraceptives and involved in FP more.
The support of married Afghan men to use FP methods in this
study was more than a study in Ethiopia (Kassa et al., 2014). The
study by Dewi illustrated that men can keep important roles by
giving support in using family planning and also during the preg-
nancy period of their wives. These findings are consistent with
the findings of the present study (Dewi, 2009). Less than 10%
of studied men did not participate in family planning program
at all. "Supporting and reminding" were the most frequent types
of participation, and "preparing the contraception" the least fre-
quent one. Moreover, women whose spouses participated in family
planning program were significantly (p<0.001) more satisfied than
those whose spouses did not participate. Women receiving support
are more probable to continue using family planning. In this study,
the number of children in families that husbands did not partici-
pate in family planning was significantly (p<0.001) higher than the
other group that is similar to what Overdiran found in his study
Oyediran et al., 2012).
According to this study, the factors that encouraged men to
participate in family planning were the concerns about the fu-
ture of children and the health and welfare of the mothers. How-
ever, cultural norms supporting larger families, the desire for hav-
ing boy children, the fear of contraception's side effects and reli-
gious prohibitions discouraged them in using FP. These results are
in line with the exploratory qualitative study conducted by USAID
to identify factors that influence use of family planning methods
at the individual, couple/family, service accessibility, socio-cultural
and policy environment for improvement of contraceptive use in
Afghanistan (USAID 2017). Shafiqollah et al. also pointed out some
factors such as religious prohibitions and cultural norms as incen-
tives for Afghans not to sought FP (Shafiqullah et al., 2018).
Conclusion
The aim of this study was to determine men's participa-
tion in family planning from the perspectives of their wives in
Afghanistan. The results indicate that men have interest in fam-
ily planning in this country. Several factors affect the participation
of men in such programs. Younger couples, the ones with higher
income and education reported higher degree of male participa-
tion in family planning. They supported their wives in the use of
contraceptives more than other groups. Recognition of these fac-
tors can help policy makers in designing behavioral interventions.
A couple-oriented approach to family planning would be helpful.
The factors that discourage men to participate family planning
need to be addressed. About religious prohibitions, talking with
clergies might help. By prioritizing children's education and the
welfare of wives by new generation, the cultural norms about
larger families will change in future. By providing information
about family planning particularly to young people, the use of con-
traceptives will increase in this country. However, the aim of such
activities should not necessarily be decreasing the size of popula-
tion but the fulfilment of people' sexual and reproductive rights.

Limitations of the study
In this study, women were asked about the participation of
their husbands that might be different with the opinion of their
husbands. So, our findings should be interpreted with caution. The
other limitation was that the study population was women refer-
ring to family planning centers. So, the results cannot be general-
ized to all Afghan women. Still with these limitations, this study
provides useful insights for policy makers in Afghanistan to better
implement family planning programs.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Child and maternal health, a key marker of overall health system performance, is a policy priority
area by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, including the Sustainable Development Goals.
Previous realist work has linked child and maternal health outcomes to globalization, political tradition, and the
welfare state. It is important to explore the role of other key policy-related factors. This paper presents a realist
synthesis, categorising policy instruments according to the established NATO model, to develop an explanatory
model of how policy instruments impact child and maternal health outcomes.
Methods: A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies assessing the relationships between
policy instruments and child and maternal health outcomes. Data were analysed using a realist framework. The
first stage of the realist analysis process was to generate micro-theoretical initial programme theories for use in
the theory adjudication process. Proposed theories were then adjudicated iteratively to produce a set of final
programme theories.
Findings: From a total of 43,415 unique records, 632 records proceeded to full-text screening and 138 papers were
included in the review. Evidence from 132 studies was available to address this research question. Studies were
published from 1995 to 2021; 76% assessed a single country, and 81% analysed data at the ecological level.
Eighty-eight initial candidate programme theories were generated. Following theory adjudication, five final
programme theories were supported. According to the NATO model, these were related to treasure, organisation,
authority-treasure, and treasure-organisation instrument types.
Conclusions: This paper presents a realist synthesis to develop an explanatory model of how policy instruments
impact child and maternal health outcomes from a large, systematically identified international body of evi-
dence. Five final programme theories were supported, showing how policy instruments play an important yet
context-dependent role in influencing child and maternal health outcomes.
1.1. Linking political factors to child and maternal health
Politics has been defined as 'the practice of the art and science of
administering states' (
). Longstanding
McLean and McMillan, 2003
conceptual and theoretical links between politics and population health
exists. The notion that 'medicine is a social science, and politics nothing
but medicine at a larger scale' (Virchow, cited by Mackenbach, 2009)
has been described as 'public health's biggest idea' (Mackenbach, 2009)
Despite the emergence in recent decades of formal evidence-based
pathways for policymaking in the context of pharmaceuticals and
other health technologies (Banta, 2003; Sorenson and Chalkidou, 2012)
especially in developed countries, politics continues to exert a strong
influence on many aspects of broader health-related policymaking
Reijneveld, 2017
), leading to evidence-policy gaps (
Ferrie, 2015)
Therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which these effects oper-
ate is important for understanding the determinants of population
health.
Child and maternal health are key outcome domains within popu-
lation health. Child and maternal health outcomes have been shown to
directly reflect a country's overall health system performance, hence

acting as an effective marker of the health of a country's health system
(Pinzon-Florez et al., 2015). Moreover, reducing maternal mortality by
75% and achieving universal access to reproductive health were key
elements of Millennium Development Goal 5, which were not met in
2015 despite considerable progress (World Bank,). This relates to the
United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal 3 Good health and
well-being, in particular, Target 3.1, which aims to reduce the global
maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births and
Target 3.2, which aims to end all preventable deaths under five years of
age and keep neonatal mortality in all countries to below 12 per 1000
live births and under-5 mortality to below 25 per 1000 live births,
intended to be achieved by 2030 (United Nations General Assembly,
). Meanwhile, the American Public Health Association has identi-

A previous realist review (Barnish et al., 2021) considered four po-
litical exposures — democracy, welfare state provision, political tradition
and globalisation — in relation to child and maternal health outcomes.
Especially in more developed countries, left-of-centre political tradition
generated a greater focus on welfare state measures contributing to
reduced child mortality and low birth weight, while a more generous
welfare state improved social conditions, contributing to reductions in
infant and maternal mortality. In lower-and-middle income countries
(LMICs), increased globalisation led to increased international trade
dependency and increased influence of multinational corporations and
international trade organisations, contributing to increased child and
infant mortality and youth smoking rates. This provided greater insight
into understanding the extent to which different political exposures
could affect child and maternal health outcomes. In this paper, we
address a gap identified in this work to examine the roles and in-
teractions of policy instruments on child and maternal health. This ad-
vances the understanding of how a broader range of policy-level
exposures relate to these outcomes and what mechanisms may operate.
1.2. Relevant theoretical perspectives
Realist synthesis (Pawson et al., 2005) is an approach to evidence
synthesis that facilitates moving beyond descriptive analysis to offer a
theoretically informed explanatory insight into how the effects identi-
fied in a body of evidence may operate. The theoretical insights garnered
through realist synthesis are conceptualised in terms of programme
theories, which are composed of context-mechanism-outcome configu-
rations (CMOs). The theoretical lens of realist synthesis is based on the
epistemological foundations of critical realism (
). A realist
Bhaskar, 1975
synthesis culminates in a context-specific and temporally sensitive
middle-range theory, enabling the understanding of a wide range of
intermingling relations between contexts and mechanisms that lead to
favourable or unfavourable population health outcomes.
A number of macro-theoretical perspectives may inform consider-
ations around the relationship between politics and population health.
Key relevant political theories include neoliberalism (
Mirowski and
), dependency theory (
), and socialist and
Piehwe, 2009
James, 1997
social democratic theories (Bailey, 2009; Lamb and Docherty, 2006) In
the context of democracy, political tradition, welfare state provision and
globalisation in relation to child and maternal health, it was found that
the realist programme theories supported by the evidence base aligned
most closely with macro-theoretical perspectives within the broadly
socialist sphere (Barnish et al., 2021)
In addition to the above political exposures, there are further theo-
retical perspectives relevant to population health which are specifically
appertaining to policy instruments.

Hood (1986)
developed a framework of four types of
resources (nodality, authority, treasure, and organization, or NATO in
Social Science & Medicine 339 (2023) 116402
Hood's terminology), that can be used by governments to address policy
problems (see also the table below). In this study, the NATO model is
used to analyse the targets of interventional tools and the relation be-
tween tools and goals of the interventions. Nodality refers to informa-
tion advantage through the centrality of the government in various
networks; authority refers to the legal power of the government to
command, regulate, or delegate to achieve goals; treasure refers to a
wide variety of financial incentives and mechanisms such as the ability
to demand taxes or fund initiatives; and organizational instruments
involve the deployment of resources to form organisations and markets
and provide goods and services such as through the deployment of
personnel to improve operational performance or structure (see
Table 2
). While there are a variety of instrument classifications available
(Pal, 2014
), such as the approaches taken by Linder and Peters (1989),
Salamon (2002), Stewart (2009) and Vedung (1998),
the NATO frame-
work (
Hood, 1986
) offers the advantages of being a widely used,
long-established approach using four broad analytical categories.
1.3. Aims of the current work
Much about what has been written on the programmatic innovation
and health system strengthening efforts to improve maternal and child
health outcomes understand these efforts as either top-down reform or
bottom-up strategy involving a limited number of actors and in-
stitutions. These innovations and efforts often comprise a spectrum of
strategies that involve the deployment of a single instrument or multiple
instruments packaged together in a single reform initiative. In addition,
the implementation mechanisms of these initiatives can be far more
intricate, involving multiple actors and institutions working either
uniformly, synergistically, or antagonistically. The understanding of
tools and implementation mechanisms in these reform initiatives that
strengthen child and maternal health has not been studied extensively,
to the best of our knowledge. Moreover, existing policy evaluations in
this area have tended to be successionist and descriptive, while the field
would benefit from a shift to a generative, realist approach that provides
an explanatory account. Thus, the current work synthesises evidence
linking policy instruments, analysed using the NATO model (Hood,
), to child and maternal health outcomes.

policy instruments; assessing child and/or maternal health outcomes,
but not fertility (given interpretation of fertility outcomes as 'success' or
'failure' depends on baseline rate).
The following bibliographic databases were searched in March 2021
to identify studies.
• MEDLINE ALL (Ovid)
• APA Psyclnfo (Ovid)
• Health Management Information Consortium (Ovid)
• Global Health (Ovid)
• Social Policy and Practice (Ovid)
• Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics)
• International Bibliography of the Social Sciences (ProQuest)
The search strategies were developed by an information specialist
following a discussion with the project lead. The information specialist
conducted all searches, starting with database searches followed by
supplementary searches and citation chasing.
Database searches comprised terms for women and children, terms
for different policy/political exposures (both general terms and terms
related to policy instruments to ensure coverage), and terms for health
services and disparities. No study type filters or date limits were used,
but results were limited to the English language. To increase specificity,
a search for expected outcomes was also added, using likely outcomes as
identified in a prior realist review on political factors in relation to child
and maternal health (Barnish et al., 2021). The full search strategy can
be found in Appendix A.
The search process was iterative. Relevant references from the initial
realist review were used as a test set to ensure they were captured in the
final search results. Different subject headings and keywords were tested
systematically to identify which of these captured the full test set and
which excluded some papers to achieve an optimum balance of sensi-
tivity and specificity.
The search results were exported to Endnote X9 (Thomson Reuters,
NY, USA) and de-duplicated using automatic checking. Items included
after full-text screening were forward and backward citation chased
using Scopus (Elsevier) and Web of Science (Clarivate) to identify
additional relevant studies.
First and last author searches were conducted on a pilot selection of
10 key papers in Scopus. Since in all cases the corresponding author was
either the first or last author, separate corresponding author searches
were not required. Searches of included studies and key identified re-
views were also conducted.
Title and abstract screening were initially conducted by one
reviewer, and a 10% independent screening check was performed by a
second reviewer. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion be-
tween the initial two reviewers, involving two further senior team
members as required. Potentially relevant records proceeded to full-text
review, which was initially conducted by one reviewer with a 50%
Social Science & Medicine 339 (2023) 116402
independent screening check by a second reviewer. Any discrepancies
were resolved by discussion involving two further senior team members
as required.
Data extraction was conducted by one reviewer, and a 50% inde-
pendent check was conducted by a second reviewer. Any disagreements
were resolved by discussion involving two further senior team members
as appropriate. Data were extracted onto a standardised form, designed
to capture the following information: Bibliographic details; country/
countries of study; methodology; Ssmple size; sampling frame; years of
study; exposure measure; outcome measure; results; information to help
develop programme theories. When deciding which results to extract, all
key study findings relevant to the review question were extracted, with a
focus on narrative results that could enrich theory development and
adjudication rather than quantitative effect sizes and p-values as used to
inform meta-analyses.
Level of development was categorised into a binary classification of
developed countries vs LMICs, whereby countries on the World Bank
high-income list (World Bank, undated a) were classified as developed,
and countries on the World Bank low-income (World Bank, undated b)
and middle income (World Bank,
undated c) lists were classified as
LMICs. Since this study used realist methods, no formal assessment of
the risk of bias was undertaken.
2.2. Realist analysis
The first stage of the realist analysis process was to generate micro-
theoretical initial programme theories for use in the theory adjudica-
tion process. Realist initial programme theory development is typically
an iterative process informed by a defined set of sources of knowledge,
which can include textual sources, discussions, broader epistemological
and theoretical perspectives applicable to the broad field of study, and
the authors' subject knowledge. To ensure a broad range of perspectives
were taken into account, included studies were each randomly assigned
to one of four reviewers with different disciplinary backgrounds.
Through engagement with the assigned study, as well as broader in-
formation from the body of studies as a whole and relevant theoretical
perspectives, the four reviewers formed initial programme theories via a
process of open coding.
These initial programme theories were first dimensionalised (i.e.,
related to each other across studies to understand similarities and dif-
ferences) by two reviewers in the context of policy instruments applying
the NATO model (
). They were then iteratively discussed and
Hood, 1986
adjudicated in a series of team meetings.
Theory adjudication, i.e. "which theories around the intervention
seem to fit best" (Rycroft-Malone et al., 2012), was performed separately
for each programme theory. Coding was conducted manually. For this
process, studies were divided in a 2:1 ratio between two reviewers, and
the results of this adjudication were verified and refined through itera-
tive rounds of discussion at meetings attended by all four reviewers. The
process involved an overall assessment of the consistency of findings (i.
e. , assessment of demi-regularities in outcome patterns by
context-mechanism combinations) in the direction that would support
the programme theory. Consistency and strength of evidence were
assessed by discussion among the team, taking into account how many
studies were available, how many of the studies had broadly comparable
findings and the geographical profile of the findings. Then, a more
detailed assessment of studies for which the findings were in the di-
rection that would support the programme theory was conducted. This
enabled the precise context mechanism and outcome configuration to be
tested and refined. The concept of mechanism was defined as per
Falleti
"portable concepts that explain how and why a hy-

pothesized cause, in a given context, contributes to a particular
outcome". Since many studies incorporated countries at different levels
of development, it was not feasible to stratify the analysis by level of
development.

3. Results
3.1. Identification of evidence
Database searches yielded a total of 39,743 records (see Appendix A
for breakdown by each database), of which 33,774 remained following
de-duplication. This was supplemented by 7361 additional unique re-
cords from citation chasing and 2280 from author searches, for an
overall total of 43,415 unique records. Following title and abstract
screening, 632 records proceeded to full-text screening. A total of 138
publications proceeded to inclusion, representing a total of 132 unique
studies. Concordance between the two reviewers was 99% at title and
abstract screening and 90% at full-text screening, which the review team
considered to be appropriately high. A list of articles screened at the full-
text stage, indicating which were included and which were excluded

), 16 studies (11%) used
clustered, household- or area-based designs (Abdulahi et al., 2021,
Adubra et al., 2019; Alexiou et al., 2021; Arifeen et al., 2009; Bang et al.,

Robertson et al., 2013; Saville et al., 2018), while the remainder used
other ecological approaches such as country case studies, panel designs
and serial cross-sectional studies. Three studies (2%) used qualitative
designs (
Brault et al., 2017; Katahoire et al., 2015; vos et al., 2016) SIX
studies (5%) used mixed methods designs (Brault et al., 2018; Gram
et al., 2019; Huicho et al., 2016; Lindsay, 2002; Margolis et al., 1995;
Saville et al., 2018), and the remainder used quantitative designs.
Studies were published from 1995 to 2021, and the collective period
of data collection was from 1960 to 2019. The duration of data collec-
tion ranged across studies from less than one year to 41 years. The start
or end year of data was not available for 14 studies (11%). Thirty-three
studies (25%) were conducted exclusively in developed countries, 84
studies (64%) were conducted exclusively in LMICs, and 14 studies
(11%) included both developed countries and LMICs. One study on 'EU
developing countries' (Onofrei et al., 2021) included both developed
countries and LMICs according to World Bank criteria. Full Information
about the level of development was not available for four studies (4%).
Across the 132 included studies, 100 (76%) included data from a single
country, while 32 (24%) included data from multiple countries, and
seven (5%) included data from a panel of at least 100 countries (

3.3. Initial programme theories
Separate lists of initial programme theories were generated by each
of the four reviewers based on their respective allocated studies.
Following de-duplication and initial dimensionalisation, 88 candidate
programme theories were produced and analysed according to the
NATO model (Hood, 1986
). This list is provided in Appendix E.
3.4. Theory adjudication
After further iteration and integration of candidate programme
theories as part of the theory adjudication process, four candidate CMO
domains were considered to be well supported by the evidence base.
Two of these were single-instrument candidate CMOs domains: treasure
and organisation, while two were multi-instrument configurations:
authority-treasure and treasure-organisation. Treasure appeared overall
to be the most frequently supported domain at this stage in the analysis.
Within the single-instrument treasure domain, support was greatest with
regard to expenditure on health and/or social services (both improve-
ments in outcomes associated with increased investment and deterio-
ration in outcomes associated with austerity measures) and cash transfer
programmes. Within the single-instrument organisation domain, sup-
port was greatest for overall health-system improvements, integration
and strengthening, and focused health interventions for child and
maternal health, including in the community. Nodality-based ap-
proaches were not among the best supported.
After the best-supported candidate CMO domains were identified
within the evidence base (
), further iterative team discussion
Table 1
elucidated more specific final programme theories, i.e. CMO configu-
rations, within these domains (Table 3). A full list of included studies to
support the analysis is provided in Appendix F. In order to provide richer
insight into the results underpinning these final programme theories, a

final programme theories, categorised by instrument type and level of
development, is provided in Appendix G.
3.4.1. Final programme theory 1
Increased public expenditure, especially in LMICs with sufficient
governance to facilitate administrative capacity, led to lower infant and
under-5 mortality through improved government effectiveness in
expanding health facilities and access (NATO policy instrument domain
treasure; authority-treasure).
Ashiabi et al. (2016), Bishai et al. (2016), and Langnel and Buracom
found that in an LMIC context, increased public expenditure on
(2020)
health led to lower child mortality rates through an improvement in
health service provision and access, but this effect depended on coun-
tries having sufficient governance to facilitate administrative capacity.
On a related theme,
Behera and Dash (2020)
found that in Southeast
Asian countries, increased public health expenditure showed positive
effects on the reduction of infant mortality achieved through the
mechanism of improved government effectiveness to expand healthcare
facilities. Furthermore,
found that governmental
Farag et al. (2013)
effectiveness — with a level of good governance as a proxy— acted as a
mechanism for the significant effect of governmental spending on health
on the reduction of infant and child mortality in a panel of 133 LMICs
from 1995 to 2006.
Factor and Kang (2015) did not find a direct rela-
tionship between health expenditure and health outcomes once other
factors such as level of economic development, regime autocracy and
corruption had been considered, suggesting these may be important
determinants of child and maternal health outcomes.
Taking a different perspective, Nyamuranga and Shin (2019) iden-
tified immunization, female literacy, improved water sources and
reduced HIV prevalence as mechanisms for the impact of increased
health expenditure on the reduction of infant and under-5 mortality in
LMICs. Considering 17 countries from 1973 to 2000,
Kim and Lane
found further evidence supporting the beneficial impact of
(2013)
increased health expenditures on infant mortality and life expectancy at
birth. While many studies focused on health expenditures, Bradley et al.
found that in OECD countries, an increased ratio of social relative
(2011)
to health expenditures was predictive of better outcomes in infant
mortality, life expectancy, and increased potential life years lost after
adjusting for the level of health expenditures and GDP. Goldstein et al.
found that increased spending on environmental, educational,
(2020)
and infant mortality all reduced infant mortality, the impact being
greatest with lower maternal age.
identified that,
Hall et al. (2021)
especially in lower-income contexts, increased financial investment is
linked with rapid impacts on under-five and maternal mortality through
improvements in government spending on health and infrastructure and
improved household spending, while conversely, government debt
refinancing or tax incentives may lead to short-term worsening in health
due to a reduced ability to spend at both household and government
levels. Focusing on more specific types of increased investment,
Haji-
zadeh et al. (2015) demonstrated the benefit of paid maternity leave on
childhood vaccination uptake in a sample of 20 LMICs. Also, in a
lower-income context, in Burkina Faso,
Meda et al. (2018)
did not find
evidence for the influence of a fee subsidy policy for deliveries and
emergency obstetric and neonatal care on neonatal mortality rates,
although institutional deliveries themselves were increased. In a
high-income context,
found that
Susan Marquis and Long, 2002
expanding public insurance led to better health outcomes for women
through improved access to maternal care services, while a maternal and
child health services block grant facilitated reduced infant mortality

Considering the authority-treasure domain further, certain studies
offered insight into favourable treasury policies that lack enforcement.
stated that governmental
Gitobu et al. (2017)
In a Kenyan context,
policy to waive delivery charges in public health facilities did not
improve maternal survival or influence the causes of maternal mortality.
Also, in a Kenyan context,
found that a delivery
Gitobu et al. (2018)
Social Science & Medicine 339 (2023) 116402
charge waiver policy in public health facilities statistically significantly
increased the number of facility-based deliveries, but this did not
convert into a significant reduction in maternal or neonatal mortality.
After adjusting for patient characteristics,
Taylor et al. (2020)
in a
Medicaid non-expansion state in the US did not find an association be-
tween Medicaid status at delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Urquieta-Salomon et al. (2020) identified increased utilisation of health
services and increase in health equity as potential mechanisms for the
beneficial impact of universal health insurance legislation on maternal
and child health.
Furthermore, certain studies showed how authority mechanisms
bolstered the deployment of treasury tools.
Irish et al. (2021)
found that
changes to the treasure-related instrument of parental leave imple-
mented based on authority mechanisms in a high-income context are
associated with diffuse maternal and child health outcomes. Improve-
ments in income and family bonding were identified as mechanisms, but
outcomes also depended on the context of family resilience and eco-
found that reform of Austrian
nomic status.
Ahammer et al. (2020)
maternity leave legislation in 1974 to extend compulsory prenatal leave
did not improve children's health at birth or long-term health.
Tanaka
identified adequate payment and job protection as key de-
(2005)
terminants of the success of parental leave policies on child health
outcomes in a panel of 18 OECD countries from 1969 to 2000, as they
facilitate parental leave-taking behaviour. Turning to a low- and
middle-income context,
also found little evi-
Jahagirdar et al. (2017)
dence that changes in legislated paid maternity leave were sufficient to
affect child height-for-age. It was considered that the relatively short
duration of legislated leave, potential low coverage and increases in
child growth in this particular setting may explain these findings.
3.4.2. Final programme theory 2
Austerity measures especially in LICs and areas of greater socioeco-
nomic deprivation led to worse perinatal outcomes, life expectancy at
birth and child mortality through weakened social protection (NATO
policy instrument domain treasure).
Three studies examined the impact of austerity programmes. In a
high-income context,
found that large budget cuts in
Rajmil et al. (2018)
education, health and other public services resulted in adverse trends in
perinatal outcomes (low birth weight and infant mortality) and the so-
Cial determinants of health (child poverty rates and severe material
deprivation in families with primary age children), potentially due to
weakened social protection, while
showed the
Alexiou et al. (2021)
disproportionate impact of funding cuts on life expectancy at birth in
more socially deprived areas of England. Considering a sample of 176
countries at different levels of economic development, Maruthappu et al.
showed that reductions in government healthcare spending led
(2015)
to increased child mortality, with the impact being greater in
low-income countries.
This provides a consistent finding across Alexiou et al. (2021) and
Maruthappu et al. (2015)
that the adverse impact of austerity pro-
grammes is greater in the context of greater socio-economic deprivation.
From a related perspective, Kayode et al. (2016) found that irregular and
insufficient funding and lack of sufficient monitoring and evaluation
were some of the biggest implementation challenges for policies to
strengthen maternal care.
3.4.3. Final programme theory 3
Conditional cash transfer programmes, especially with adequate
community participation and a strong nutritional component in LMICs,
led to improved child growth and anthropometric outcomes and
reduced infant mortality through strengthened household financial se-
curity and empowerment to access health services (NATO policy in-
strument domains treasure and treasure-organisation).
It was noted that cash transfer programmes were primarily studied in
an LMIC context, as would be expected given their particular relevance
in this economic context. Empowering people to access health services,
6


M.S. Barnish et al.
especially where the cash transfer programme has a strong nutritional
component, was identified by studies focusing on CCTs as a mechanism
for the positive impact of cash transfer programme participation on
child growth and anthropometric outcomes as well as infant mortality
reduction. This potential mechanism was reinforced by Rasella et al.
which showed that an increased income as a result of a CCT
(2013),
programme can improve access to food and health-related services,
facilitating a reduction in under-5 mortality.
Sanchez et al. (2020)
further reinforces the value of CCTs for improving nutritional status,
while
Grellety et al. (2017)
emphasise strengthened financial security
for vulnerable households as a mechanism by which these gains may be
achieved. Behaviour change may be another mechanism by which cash
transfer programmes achieve their benefit. This is related to strength-
ened financial security since this security may, in turn, enable people to
change their health-related behaviours. De Andrade et al. (2018) found
that CCTs led to decreased leprosy incidence in individuals under 15
years old potentially through enhancing early detection and prompt
treatment of cases, reducing transmission, occurrence of disabilities and
negative social consequences due to leprosy, while
Cluver et al. (2013)
found that cash transfers can reduce HIV adolescence among adolescent
girls through reducing risk behaviours. The importance of ensuring
adequate participation in cash transfer programmes was shown by a
study from Brazil (Labrecque et al., 2018), which showed a negative
association between conditional cash transfer (CCT) programme
participation and child length- and weight-for-age in the context of low
participation rates in the CCT. However, it is important to note incon-
sistent evidence for the benefit of CCT programmes, with Lopez-Arana
showing a positive impact on thinness but not the more
et al. (2016)
prevalent outcome of stunting in Colombia. Mascie-Taylor et al. (2010)
showed that a cash-for-work programme in Bangladesh improved
childhood nutritional status and associated anthropometric status
through facilitating greater household expenditure on food and conse-
quent consumption of more protein-rich food.
Shaefer et al. (2020)
considered the opposite direction of effect, assessing the negative impact
of the decline of cash assistance in a US context in a state-level analysis
from 2001 to 2015. It was found that the decline of cash assistance
increased household food insecurity and child homelessness among
those in state education, with the reduction in financial means, espe-
cially for women with greater social deprivation and stagnation in
maternal employment, identified as a potential mechanism.

tive programme in India was differential according to the level of area
deprivation, leading to increased inequality despite improved maternal
health outcomes, emphasising the need for more targeted interventions.
Barber and Gertler (2008) and Perez-Lu et al. (2017) both emphasised
the importance of system co-ordination for successful CCTs, noting that
both treasure and organisation elements have an important role to play.
3.4.4. Final programme theory 4
Health system strengthening, including achieving greater integration
of maternal and child health programmes into the national health
agenda in LMICs, led to reduced under-5 and maternal mortality
through country-level including economic growth and improved infra-
structure, health-system factors, including increased investment in
midwifery training, increased funding for salaries and resources,
increased facility births and increased skilled birth attendance, and a
high level of acceptance by providers and patients (NATO policy in-
strument domain organisation; treasure-organisation).
Kayode et al. (2016), in a Ghanian context, found that the benefit of
increasing and strengthening cost-effective and neonatal-specific in-
terventions such as the Safe Motherhood Program (SMP) and
Community-Based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) Program on
Social Science & Medicine 339 (2023) 116402
under-5 mortality in line with MDG4 was achieved through high levels
of acceptance of the policies and interventions among health providers
and patients, which improved utilisation rates. Furthermore, in
Pakistan,
found that integrating newborn care in
Khan et al. (2012)
national health policies and programmes facilitated reduced neonatal
mortality and identified the catalysation of newborn services at both
facility and community levels through the National Maternal, Newborn
and Child Health Programme as a mechanism. In turn, this strength-
ening of the integration of neonatal care into the national health agenda
has been facilitated by civil society and academic advocacy and advisory
links with the government. In a Cambodian context,
Liljestrand and
found that another health system-strengthening
Sambath (2012)
initiative, the Safe Motherhood Programme, increasing the incorpora-
tion of maternal health into the national health agenda, facilitated a
reduction in maternal mortality. Country-level factors, such as peace
and stability, economic growth, improved transport and communication
infrastructure and improved female education, as well as health-system
factors, such as increased facility-based births, increased investment in
midwifery training, and increased skilled birth attendance, were iden-
tified as potential mechanisms.
In the context of health system capacity strengthening,
Fernandes
et al. (2014)
found a decrease in child mortality in Mozambique and
identified a combination of financial and structural institutional mech-
anisms: increased health workforce density, increased institutional birth
coverage and increased governmental budgetary resources to support
salaries and other health-facility running costs. This shows how treasury
tools can augment positive child and maternal outcomes when operating
in the context of community participation and system-wide reforms.
3.4.5. Final programme theory 5
Focused maternal and child health interventions led to reduced
maternal, perinatal, infant and under-5 mortality in LMICs through a
demographically responsive health system and improved sickness
management (NATO policy instrument domain organisation).
and
Okafor et al. (2011),
Bang et al. (2005)
in an LMIC context,
found that focused maternal and neonatal care programmes led to
reduced perinatal and maternal mortality through improved sickness
management. Meanwhile,
found that favourable
Acuin et al. (2011)
health system development related to obstetric care and interventions
directed towards infectious diseases predicted a rapid decline in
maternal, infant and under-5 mortality in an Asian context with modest
levels of economic growth. The key mechanism of this effect was iden-
tified as having a demographically responsive health system. Compre-
hensive district-level health programmes in Laos, including
strengthening of district health management and improving access to
health facilities led to increased healthcare utilisation at a population
level, in turn facilitating a reduction in child and infant mortality rates
in a Brazilian context,
(Perks et al., 2006). Aquino et al. (2009),
corroborated the view that reorganisation of primary health care can
reduce infant mortality, also noting a reduction of health inequalities
through a greater reduction in areas with higher baseline infant mor-
tality. In a Tanzanian context, Armstrong-Schellenberg et al. (2004) also
found that a strategy to integrate the management of childhood illness
reduced under-5 mortality and identified facilitating access to health
facilities and consequent high utilisation as potential mechanisms. In a
Nigerian context, Findley et al. (2013) identified that participatory and
community-based interventions in the context of an integrated
maternal, newborn and child health program increased skilled birth
attendance and follow-up and infant vaccination rates as well as reduced
infant mortality rates.
specifically identified a
Findley et al. (2016)
benefit from increasing participation. However,
Narwal and Gram
in an Indian context, found no evidence for the benefit of the
(2013),
National Rural Health Mission on infant mortality, suggesting a need for
more robust monitoring and evaluation processes.
Specifically, in the context of a conditional cash transfer programme
intervention incorporating a lipid-based nutrient supplement,
Adubra
7


M.S. Barnish et al.
et al. (2019)
identified weakness in intervention design and suboptimal
implementation (short duration and poor coverage) as reasons for
negative effects on stunting. Turning in particular to the role of com-
munity health workers,
Meghea et al. (2013),
specifically in a US
context, found no overall benefit on child health of the introduction of
community health workers, whereas contrastingly
Abdulahi et al.
found the introduction of community health workers to be an
(2021)
important component of how the health system is organised for the
benefit of child health. While it is not possible to know for certain, this
discrepancy in outcomes may relate to differences in health systems
context. Considering another nutrition-based intervention, the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
in the United States found that the
(WIC),
Bitler and Currie (2005)
intervention was associated with improved birth outcomes with the ef-
fect being greater among more disadvantaged women.
4. Discussion
4.1. Summary
This article presents a realist review focusing on child and maternal
health incomes in relation to policy instruments. It identifies several
theories relating to public expenditure, austerity, conditional cash
transfer programmes, health system strengthening and focused maternal
and child health interventions. Treasure and organisation were the most
consistently effective single policy instruments using the NATO model.
Considering multiple instruments, the combination of authority-treasure
and treasure-organisation was shown to be particularly synergistic. The
effectiveness of particular instruments was shown to be context-
dependent rather than context-independent. It was noted that nodality
did not feature among the best-supported policy instruments in this
review. It is not possible to determine whether this reflects a relative
ineffectiveness of nodality for child and maternal health, a preference on
the part of governments to deploy other strategies, and/or a preference
by researchers and funders to study other policy instrument types.
4.2. Contextualisation
This work builds on a prior realist review by Barnish et al. (2021),
which also considered child and maternal health outcomes in the
context of a different but related set of political exposures — democracy,
political tradition, the welfare state, and globalisation. As such, the
specific programme theories are different but share some thematic
commonalities. The current work excluded fertility outcomes to improve
the specificity of the results. This is because the directionality of the
effect of fertility data depends on the baseline population density of the
study, which will differ between countries included within a single study
as well as across studies. Furthermore, the present review also includes
studies that presented data from only one sovereign country, whereas
the prior review only considered internationally comparative studies.
Thirty-eight of the included studies in the current work were interna-
tionally comparative. The addition of studies assessing a single country
offers a valuable perspective, given the selection of policy instruments
can be influenced by a range of country-specific factors. The policy in-
strument theoretical lens helps public health scholars to examine the
broader institutional apparatuses matter in affecting governance and
capacity in implementing mega health programmes and interventions
aiming to improve maternal and child health and how these forces result
in programmes and interventions being enforced or veered away from
the intended outcomes.
The present review targets the final of the five key steps identified by
Berry and Saloner (2021) for the use of policy to generate substantial
population health benefits: that is to say, evaluating the effects of pol-
icies. Work by
Gelius et al. (2022)
found that the selection of harder or
softer policy instruments depends on the outcomes sought. The present
work found that harder policy instruments, such as treasure-based
Social Science & Medicine 339 (2023) 116402
instruments, were generally preferred in the context of child and
maternal health outcomes, with softer instruments, in particular
nodality-based instruments, not featuring among the most effective
strategies. Policy instruments deployed for child and maternal health
had more in common with those deployed for tobacco and alcohol policy
rather than those for encouraging good nutrition and physical activity in
the general population (
Gelius et al., 2022)
The realist perspective generated micro-theoretical initial pro-
gramme theories, which were iterated through multiple rounds of dis-
cussion to adjudicate the proposed theories and to situate them in the
context of macro-theoretical perspectives from the wider literature. For
instance, the cross-fertilisation of public policy theories and public
health literature means that we could apply a policy instrument theo-
retical lens from public policy to dissect public health interventions for
maternal and child health to achieve a system-level understanding of
their implementation mechanisms, as well as dissecting the explicit and
hidden factors within the entire health system governance structure that
affect the success and failure of these programmes, interventions and
reforms.
The present work shows different approaches that governments and
health system organisations have deployed as they seek to address the
international health priorities (World Bank., United Nations General
Assembly, 2017) of child and maternal health in the context of 'the
practice of the art and science of administering states' that constitutes
politics (
). Analysis was undertaken using

affords an advantage to the present work in drawing commonalities and
distinguishing context-specific differences in instrument deployment
compared to an approach such as Kirschen (1964), which offers greater
granularity. However, with 62 different types of policy instruments
identified, it is less amenable to comparative analysis across contexts.
Greater use of treasure and authority-related instruments may be
generally more aligned with social democratic and/or socialist macro-
theoretical perspectives (Bailey, 2009; Lamb and Docherty, 2006)
However, this will depend on specific local cultural and political con-
texts, as well as factors related to health system organisation. Further-
more, an international context introduces systematic and idiosyncratic
complexities in the mapping between political characteristics and spe-
cific political parties (Barnish et al., 2018)
4.3. Strengths and limitations
This work benefits from the use of realist methodology, drawing on
the theoretical lens of critical realism, to offer an explanatory perspec-
tive to inform considerations around the relationships between policy
instruments and child and maternal health. The use of systematic
searching of seven major scholarly databases plus relevant supplemen-
tary searches and independent dual review minimised the risk of non-
retrieval and reviewer bias (
). Most studies were ecolog-
Uman, 2011
ical, which permitted studies to access larger, more representative
datasets across longer time spans than would be typically untenable with
individual-based methods such as cohort studies and randomised
controlled trials. However, the risk of ecological fallacy in extrapolating
group-level effects to constituent individuals should be considered. Most
studies were observational, which poses challenges for drawing causal
inferences, although a critical realist theoretical lens can help mitigate
this. Only English-language articles were able to be considered.

RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
Pregnancy as a Window of Opportunity for HIV Prevention:
Effects of an HIV Intervention Delivered Within Prenatal Care
Trace S. Kershaw, PhD, Urania Magriples, MD, Claire Westdahl, CNM, MPH, Sharon Schindler Rising, CNM, MSN, and Jeannette Ickovics, PhD
Young pregnant women are at high risk for
HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs).l
In a systematic review of sexual risk behavior
among pregnant or mothering adolescents, 190/0
to 390/0 had an STI during pregnancy, and 14%
to 390/0 had an STI 6 to 10 months postpartum.
Futhennore, young pregnant women were 5
times less likely to use condoms compared with
2
nulliparous women.
Despite the risks of STI and HIV infection
among women of reproductive age, few HIV
interventions have specifically targeted preg-
nant women. The Children's Health and Re-
sponsible Mothering project (Project CHARM),
a school-based intervention of pregnant and
mothering adolescents, found increases in
condom-use intentions, but no difference in
number of unprotected acts of sexual inter-
course compared with a general health pro-
motion control group. Another study found
that pregnant women given a 4-session HIV
intervention had moderate increases in knowl-
edge and safer sexual behaviors that were
4
sustained 6 months after the intervention.
Although few studies of HIV and STI inter-
ventions have targeted pregnant women, some
have focused on women attending primary
care clinics. 5 8 Interventions for STI clinic pa-
tients documented significant declines in STI
incidence.8 9 However, most HIV interventions
are limited because they do not integrate HIV
prevention with the provision of other ser-
10,11
12-14
vices,
and are not theory based.
Pregnancy offers a unique opportunity for
intervention as it is a time when women engage
in high-risk behaviors, make behavioral
changes, and have frequent contact with health
15-18
care professionals. Finally, intervenåons
integrated with existing care systems (e.g., pre-
natal care) can be sustained because care is
19
reimbursable by insurance.
The bundling of HIV prevention with exist-
ing systems can increase the accessibility of
HIV prevention by providing opportunities to
reach individuals who may not have the
Objectives. We sought to determine whether an HIV prevention program
bundled with group prenatal care reduced sexually transmitted infection (ST l)
incidence, repeat pregnancy, sexual risk behavior, and psychosocial risks.
Methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial at 2 prenatal clinics. We
assigned pregnant women aged 14 to 25 years (N=1047) to individual care,
attention-matched group care, and group care with an integrated HIV compo-
nent. We conducted structured interviews at baseline (second trimester), third
trimester, and 6 and 12 months postpartum.
Results. Mean age of participants was 20.4 years; 80% were African American.
According to intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to the HIV-prevention
group intervention were significantly less likely to have repeat pregnancy at 6
months postpartum than individual-care and attention-matched controls; they
demonstrated increased condom use and decreased unprotected sexual inter-
course compared with individual-care and attention-matched controls. Sub-
analyses showed that being in the HIV-prevention group reduced STI incidence
among the subgroup of adolescents.
Conclusion. HIV prevention integrated with prenatal care resulted in reduced
biological, behavioral, and psychosocial risks for HIV. (Am J Public Health. 2009;
99:2079-2086. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2008.154476)
motivation or time to attend stand-alone HIV
19
prevention sessions. HIV and STI prevention
programs have been successfully integrated in
care settings such as psychiatric, drug treatment,
20-22
and palliative medicine. We developed an
HIV intervention that was integrated with a
model of prenatal care.
CenteringPregnancy group prenatal

has been shown to reduce preterm

birth and increase prenatal care satisfaction.
We created a modified program, Centering-
Pregnancy Plus, by integrating HIV pre-
vention with the group prenatal care model.
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
effects of this integrated HIV prevention pro-
gram on biological outcomes (STI, repeat preg-
nancy), sexual risk behaviors (condom use, un-
protected sexual intercourse), and psychosocial
variables (communication, perceived risk, self-
efficacy).
METHODS
We conducted a randomized controlled trial
of young pregnant women receiving prenatal
care at 2 public clinics from September 2001 to
December 2004. We randomly assigned
women (N=1047) to 1 of 3 groups (CONSORT;
Figure 1): (1) standard individual prenatal care
(IC), (2) standard CenteringPregnancy group
prenatal care (CP), or (3) CenteringPregnancy
Plus group prenatal care that includes HIV-
prevention components (CPP). We conducted
baseline interviews in the second trimester
(mean = 18 weeks gestation; standard deviation
[SD] = 3.3) to correspond with the beginning
of the group prenatal program (which begins
on average at 20 weeks gestation). The par-
ticipants completed follow-up interviews in
the third trimester (mean = 35 weeks gesta-
tion; SD=3.1), and at 6 months postpartum
(mean = 27 weeks postpartum; SD=4.5), and
12 months postpartum (mean = 53 weeks post-
partum; SD=5.7).
To randomize participants, we used blocked
randomized controlled design, stratified on site
and expected month of delivery. We used a
computer-generated randomization sequence
to randomize participants with the allocation
goal of 400/0 IC, 300/0 cp, and 300/0 CPP.

FIGURE I—CONSORT study description.
Sample
Of the 1538 eligible women, 1047 (680/0)
enrolled. Recruitment was nearly equivalent
between the 2 study sites: Atlanta, Georgia
(n=546; 52%), and New Haven, Connecticut
(n=5()3; 48%). Intervention effects were not
statistically different on primary outcomes by
study site (all P > .05); therefore, analyses were
combined across sites. Even with randomiza-
tion, baseline differences can emerge by
chance. To evaluate this, we conducted and t
tests comparing study conditions on variables
assessed at baseline. By chance, individuals
randomized to CPP were more likely to be
African American (860/0 in CPP; 800/0 in CP;
750/0 in IC; 12=19.96; .003), and less likely
to have positive health behaviors (mean = 33.3
for CPP; 34.3 for IC; 33.3 for cp; F-3.65;
.026). Therefore, all subsequent analyses
controlled for these variables.
There were no differences between condi-
tions on retention at each follow-up interview
(all P > .10). Furthermore, 930/0 of participants
had at least 1 follow-up interview.
Between September 2001 and December
2004, women attending prenatal care were
referred by a health care provider or ap-
proached directly by research staff. Inclusion
criteria included (1) pregnant at less than 24
weeks gestation, (2) aged 25 years or younger,
(3) no severe medical problem (e.g., diabetes,
hypertension, HIV), and (4) able to attend
groups conducted in English or Spanish. All
participants were paid $20 for each interview.
Procedures were approved by human investi-
gation committees at both sites.
Intervention
CenteringPregnancy provides group prena-
tal care in groups of 8 to 12 women led by a
trained practitioner (e.g., midwife, obstetrician).
All prenatal care occurs within the group set-
ting except for the initial assessment. The cur-
riculum consists of 10 structured sessions (120
minutes each) during pregnancy. Participants
engage in self-care activities of weight and
blood pressure assessment and participate in
group discussion to address issues in prenatal
care, childbirth preparation, and postpartum
care. CenteringPregnancy has been described
25
in detail elsewhere.
CenteringPregnancy Plus has the same
sfiucture, time commitment, and general con-
tent as CP with the exception that for 3 sessions
(sessions 4, 5, and 7), 40 minutes is devoted to
HIV prevention skills, resulting in 120 minutes
of HIV-related content. The HIV prevention
components of CPP are based on social cogni-
tive theory and the ecological model 2 26 and are
adapted from previous efficacious interven-
tions.27 We targeted key variables from social
cognitive theory (e.g., self-efficacy, modeling)
across all levels of the ecological model including
individual (e.g., efficacy, perceived risk), dyad
(e.g., interpersonal communication), and com-
munity levels (e.g., social norms). We based our
intervention on social cognitive theory because
of its demonstrated effectiveness for adoles-
28
cents.
In session 4, participants watched testimo-
nials of adolescents with HIV to heighten risk
perceptions and social norms, discussed

barriers and benefits of condom use, person-
alized their own HIV and STI risk, and set goals
for safe sexual behavior. In session 5, partici-
pants developed sexual partner communication
skills about safe sexual behavior through role-
play and modeling. In session 7, group mem-
bers reinforced communication skills through
role play and modeling, evaluated their goals
for safe sexual behavior from session 4, and set
new goals for safe sexual behavior after preg-
nancy.
The CP control group had the same contact
time, promotion of prenatal health behaviors,
and opportunities for social support. Therefore,
it served as a true attention-matched control,
with the only difference being the specific HIV
content and focus on skills-building.
The IC participants met on the same sched-
ule and the same number of times with their
health care providers as CPP and CP; how-
ever, the contact time was consistent with
traditional prenatal care (i.e., 10 to 15 minutes
per session).
We conducted structured interviews via au-
dio computer-assisted self-interviewing. This
technology helps participants with lower reading
skills complete assessments with greater ease.
Measures
Biological outcomes. We assessed bacterial
STI acquisition (chlamydia and gonorrhea)
with biological ligase chain reaction testing. At
each follow-up, we tested participants for
chlamydia and gonorrhea with urine-based
Strand Displacement Amplification testing (BD
Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD). We assessed
the presence of STIS at each follow-up inde-
pendently of previous STI diagnoses (i.e.,
the results were not aggregated across time
points).
We assessed repeat pregnancy at 6 and 12
months postpartum by asking participants
whether they had become pregnant since their
index pregnancy. At 12 months, repeat preg-
nancy was treated as an aggregate variable
because many of the women who were preg-
nant at 6 months postpartum were also preg-
nant at 12 months.
Behavioral outcomes. Behavioral outcomes
included percentage of condom use, which we
calculated by the average self-estimated per-
centage of condom use among sexually active
participants in the past 6 months across all
RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
partners. We assessed number of unprotected
sex occasions by subtracting the number of
times participants used a condom from the
number of times they had sexual intercourse m
the past 30 days. Individuals who did not have
any sexual partners were coded as having zero
unprotected sexual acts.
Psychosocial outcomes. We assessed safe sex
communication with 4 items. Two items had
participants respond whether they had asked
or demanded to use a condom in the past 6
months. 6 For the other 2 items, participants
assessed the number of ümes in the past month
they had talked about condoms and HIV con-
cems with their sexual partner.29 Responses
were coded as talking about condoms or HIV
concems zero versus 1 or more ümes. The 4
items were summed (range=O—4), with higher
scores indicating more communication about
safe sexual activity. Results showed adequate
internal consistency across all üme points
range=O.65—O.79).
We assessed perceived HIV and STI risk by
using 2 items in which participants rated their
perceived susceptibility to getting an STI and
HIV in the next year, from chance to
30-32
3=good chance.
Results showed good
internal consistency across all üme points
range=O.82—O.85).
We assessed condom use self-efficacy with 6
items that measured how confident women
were in usmg condoms and communicating
about condoms (e.g., "How sure are you that
you could have a condom with you when you
Imagine that you and your boy-
friend have been having sex but have not used
condoms. You really want to start using con-
doms. How sure are you that you could
tell your partner you want to start using con-
doms?"). Responses ranged from I—not at
all sure to 4=very sure.33 Results showed
adequate internal consistency
range=O.70—().82).
We assessed HIV and STI risk knowledge
with 11 items with responses rangmg from
29
()=definitely false to 4=definitely true.
Results showed adequate internal consistency
across all üme points range=
0.64-0.74).
Data Analytic Plan
Analyses were a series of random effects
regression analyses based on intention-to-treat
models with randomized condition as the pri-
mary independent variable: CPP, CP, and
34,35
Random effects allow the use of all
available data rather than excluding missing
data—this allows intent-to-treat analyses to be
34,35
easily conducted.
For each random effects
regression, we treated the 3 follow-up assess-
ment points as a random effect of åme control-
ling for baseline scores. We modeled a series of
planned comparisons that looked at differences
in follow-up controlling for baseline scores for
CPP compared with the 2 control groups com-
bined (e.g., CPP versus IC and CP). For all
significant effects, we conducted post hoc analy-
ses to assess if the nature of the differences were
similar for each control group (i.e., IC and CP).
For continuous outcomes, random effect regres-
sions with general linear mixed models were
employed by using SAS PROC MIXED (SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC). For count data (e.g.,
number of unprotected sexual acts), we
employed generalized linear mixed models that
used SAS PROC GLIMMIX (SAS Insåtute lnc,
Cary, NC). For the count data, we used a Poisson
distribution, whereas for the binary data we used
a binomial distribution. For the dichotomous
variable (repeat pregnancy, STIs), we conducted
logistic regression analyses.
In addition, we assessed the possibility that
the intervention was more effective for key risk
subgroups. Therefore, we tested for 2 possible
moderators: race and age. These potential
moderators were chosen because they have
been shown to be important predictors of STI
and HIV risk.36 Interaction tests were assessed
and followed up with stratified analyses.
RESULTS
Eighty percent of participants were African
American, 130/0 were Latina, 60/0 were White,
and 10/0 were mixed or other race/ethnicity.
The average age was 20.4 years (SD=2.6);
490/0 were aged younger than 20 years and
51% were aged 20 years or older. Forty-eight
percent were nulliparous. More than half of
participants had a history of an STI diagnosis.
Biological Outcomes
As seen in Table 1, rates of bacterial STIS
were highest 12 months postpartum. The rates
of chlamydia and gonorrhea were 7.60/0 and
1.60/0 at third trimester, 6.3% and 2.1% at 6

months postpartum, and 10.30/0 and 2.9% at
12 months postpartum, respectively. Results
showed no differences between CPP and
control groups on bacterial STI incidence
(chlamydia and gonorrhea) at follow-up. How-
ever, there was a significant difference on
repeat pregnancy 6 months postpartum. When
we used logistic regression, results showed a
significant intervention effect 21=5.69;
.02). The odds of a repeat pregnancy at 6
months postpartum was significantly less likely
for CPP participants compared with IC and
CP control participants (odds ratio [OR] = 0.49;
95% confidence interval 0.91;
.02). Post hoc analyses showed that this
effect was largely driven by differences
between CPP and IC participants (OR=().39;
95% CI=O.2(), 0.75; P=.005); there was no
significant difference between CPP and CP
participants on repeat pregnancy at 6 months
postpartum (OR=O.69; 950/0 CI=O.33, 1.41;
P=.31). Furthermore, the difference between
CPP participants and IC and CP controls on
repeat pregnancy was no longer significant at
12 months postpartum (OR=().95; P=.79).
Behavioral Outcomes
There was partial support for the effective-
ness of the intervention on behavioral out-
comes. When we controlled for baseline scores,
there were no differences in condom use in the
third trimester of pregnancy. However, the
CPP group had significantly more condom use
RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
than IC and CP control participants at 6 months
postpartum (F=7.45; P=.007) and at 12
months postpartum (F— 3.93; P= .04). Post hoc
analyses showed that these differences were
somewhat stronger for IC controls than for CP
controls (d=().23 for IC and d=O.16 for CP
at 6 months postpartum; Figure 2a). Similar but
somewhat weaker results were found for
number of occasions of unprotected sexual
intercourse (Figure 2b). The CPP participants
did not differ from controls on unprotected
sexual intercourse in the third trimester of
pregnancy or at 6 months postpartum, but CPP
participants did have less unprotected sexual
intercourse compared with IC and CP control
participants at 12 months postpartum (F— 3.78;
Post hoc analyses showed that effect
sizes were comparable for both IC and CP
control groups (d=().15 versus d=O.16, re-
spectively).
To explore condom use motivations we
conducted post hoc analyses among condom
users. Of those using condoms at 6 months
postpartum, there were no differences in the
reason for condom use between the CPP par-
ticipants and the IC and CP controls (P>.()5).
Eighty-six percent of participants reported they
used condoms for pregnancy prevention and
52% reported using them for STI protection.
However, at 12 months postpartum, participants
in CPP were more likely to report using con-
doms for STI protection compared with the IC
and CP controls (64% versus 55%; P=.028).
There were no differences between groups on
use of condoms for pregnancy prevention at 12
months (with an overall rate of 83%).
Psychosocial Outcomes
The CPP participants had significantly more
communication with their sexual partners
about safe sexual activity than IC and CP
control participants during the third trimester
of pregnancy (F=25.98; P=.()()l) and at 12
months postpartum (F=4.54; .03). How-
ever, there were no differences between the
CPP group and the IC and CP control groups
at 6 months postpartum. Post hoc analyses
showed comparable differences for IC and CP
groups (d=().38 versus d=O.37) for the third
trimester of pregnancy. However, the differ-
ences at 12 months postpartum were somewhat
stronger for CP than for IC versus
d=O.16). There were no differences between
CPP and control participants on perceived risk
and condom use self-efficacy.
Subgroup Analyses
Although we did not find differences on STI
incidence among the groups, it is possible that
the intervention was stronger in some sub-
groups than in others. We tested 2 potential
moderators (race and age). Because the major-
ity of participants were African American, we
compared the effectiveness of the intervention
for African American versus non—African
American participants. There were no

significant interactions between race and in-
tervention groups on STIS at any follow-up
assessment (all P > .05).
For age, we compared adolescents (aged 14
to 19 years) with young adults (aged 20 to
25 years). Results showed a significant inter-
action between age and intervention group on
STI at 12 months postpartum (121=6.61;
.01; Figure 3). Post hoc stratified analyses
showed that among adolescents, CPP partici-
pants had significantly fewer STIS at the 12-
month follow-up compared with control par-
ticipants (9.3% versus 16.5%; OR=O.48; 95%
CI=O.24, 0.96). Post hoc analyses showed that
this effect was stronger compared with IC
control participants (OR=O.37; 950/0 CI=O.17,
0.77) than with CP participants (OR=().67;
95% CI=O.3(), 1.45). Among young adults,
there were no differences in STI rates between
the CPP group and IC and CP control partici-
pants (P=.19).
DISCUSSION
CenteringPregnancy Plus is different from
other HIV interventions because it seamlessly
RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
integrates HIV prevention into an existing
health care structure (prenatal care). By bun-
dling HIV prevention services into existing
prenatal health care services, we maximize the
reach and minimize the barriers to imple-
menting the intervention broadly to at-risk
populations. Furthermore, the additional time
needed for HIV prevention does not come at
the expense of prenatal care. We have previ-
ously shown that CPP and CP do not differ on
birth outcomes (preterm labor, low birth-
weight), prenatal care satisfaction, prenatal
25
distress, or initiation of breastfeeding.
Participation in the CPP group reduced re-
peat pregnancy at 6 months postpartum by
51% compared with participants in the control
groups. Repeat pregnancy for adolescents that
occurs shortly after index birth can increase
parenting stress and negative parenting be-
37
haviors. Therefore, this reduction in repeat
pregnancy may significantly impact quality of life
of young mothers. However, it should be noted
that this effect was not sustained by 12 months
postpartum, indicating that booster sessions may
be needed to sustain these effects. A possible
mechanism of this effect at 6 months postpartum

may have been increased breastfeeding. We
have shown in a previous study that the CPP
group had increased breastfeeding compared
with the IC group.25 We conducted a post hoc
test including breastfeeding postpartum as a
potential mediator of the repeat pregnancy effect
(results not shown). The CPP group still signifi-
cantly differed from controls with regard to
repeat pregnancy at 6 months postpartum after
we controlled for breastfeeding. Furthermore,
breastfeeding did not significantly relate to re-
peat pregnancy. This suggests that breastfeeding
was not a mechanism of the influence of CPP on
repeat pregnancy at 6 months.
Participation in the CPP group had sustain-
able effects on condom use. The CPP partici-
pants had more condom use and less unpro-
tected sexual activity than did participants in
both the IC and the CP groups. It should be
noted that these effects were primarily seen at
the postpartum follow-ups. Even though preg-
nancy is a time women may make many
changes, it may be harder for them to change
condom use behavior during pregnancy be-
cause they are not trying to prevent pregnancy.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Despite the increased availability of family planning services (FPS) in low-income countries, their use remains
low, especially in rural sub-Saharan Africa. To investigate to what extent this is explained by the husband's
involvement in the decision process, we use an experiment in rural Tanzania in which couples choose between
two payments, one being conditional on attending a family planning meeting at a health center. Experimentally
varying the husband's involvement, we find that FPS are more likely chosen in treatments that involve the
husband. Exploring potential mechanisms, we show that this is driven by couples where the wife (incorrectly)
believes that the husband disapproves of contraceptives. We also find that involving the husband increases
the wife's expectation that the family planning meeting will be attended. Both findings suggest that initiating
communication between spouses could reduce demand constraints.
Family planning (FP) aims to help couples have their desired num-
ber of children and control the spacing and timing of births. This has
important benefits for couples and their children in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs).l Large efforts have been made to provide
family planning services (FPS) at low costs in LMICs (UNFPA, 2010)
However, women's unmet need for FP remains high in most countries
in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in rural areas (UN DESA, 2015;
Izugbara et al., 2018).2 This lack of progress suggests that important
constraints remain on the demand side (Ashraf et al., 2014).
Several field experiments have analyzed whether the low uptake of
FPS can be explained by the degree of the husband's involvement in the
decision process, but the evidence is mixed. First, Ashraf et al. (2014)
found that involving the husband lowers the uptake of contraceptives
at a local private health clinic. This is in line with the idea that by-
passing the husband could increase women's uptake of contraceptives
where men want more children and have higher bargaining power

than women, as is the case in many low-income countries (Doepke
and Tertiit, 2018; World Bank, 2012
). Second, other studies found a
positive effect of the husband's involvement (Fisek and Sumbuloglu,
1978; Terefe and Larson, 1992; wang et al., 1998; McCarthy, 2019)
which they attribute to better information about FP, a change in men's
3
attitudes, and better spousal communication about FP.
The conflicting findings of these studies could be due to the different
stage in the decision-process on which they focus. Specifically, Ashraf
et al. (2014
) gave direct access to free contraceptives and randomized
the husband's involvement in the decision to take up the offer of
contraceptives. In the other studies, the husband's involvement was
randomized at an earlier stage where couples were provided with
information about FP in their homes, i.e. before they were offered any
contraceptives. In this paper, we will look at an even earlier stage:
whether couples choose to get in touch with the health system to receive
information about FP.
This decision has not been studied yet and is important for the
following reasons. First, in rural areas contraceptives are mostly dis-
tributed through FPS offered at health centers, and therefore a decision
needs to be made to visit a health center. Second, even though many
people might already have been in touch with health centers and
received some information about FP (e.g., as part of post-natal care),
knowledge about FP and the continuity of the use of modern contracep-
tives remains low. The discontinuation of contraceptives can indicate
that women are not able to make free and informed decisions when it
), have inaccurate beliefs about
comes to contraceptives (
FP2020, 2018
the efficacy of contraceptives (Miller et al., 2020), or suffer side effects.
This emphasizes the need for regular visits to the health center to
ensure that women find a FP method they are satisfied with (
FP2020,
2018; Zimmerman et al., 2021
). Third, visiting the nearest health center
in rural areas requires planning, due to (in most cases substantial)
travel needs and the fact that, at most health centers, FP meetings
are organized at fixed times and days. This adds a layer of complexity
caused by the uncertainty that the plan to visit the health center will
be carried out successfully.
The involvement of the husband at this stage could influence the
outcome in several ways. First, spouses could have different preferences
about FPS, caused by factors such as fertility preferences, current con-
traceptive use, knowledge about FP, and time preferences. Second, they
might have incomplete information about each other's preferences, as
they tend to have little communication about FP. As a result, women
might be reluctant to use FPS if they believe that their husband disap-
proves of them. However, if the husband actually supports the use of
FPS, involving the husband would increase their use (Lasee and Becker,
). Third, the uncertainty that plans to visit the health center can
1997
be carried out could create an important barrier for the uptake of FPS.
This could be alleviated if the involvement of the husband reduces this
uncertainty.
In this paper, we investigate whether and why the husband's in-
volvement influences a couple's plan to take up FPS offered at the local
health center. To do so, we use data from a lab-in-the-field experiment
in rural Tanzania in which couples choose between two payments,
one being conditional on attending a FP meeting at a local health
facility. The experiment models the first stage of the FP decision-
making process, i.e. whether to plan to go to the local health facility,
where contraceptives are delivered. Couples are randomly allocated to
one of three treatments where only the wife, only the husband or both
spouses together make the decisions. Comparing the decisions made
across these treatments allows us to analyze the causal effect of the
husband's involvement.
3 There are also several qualitative and observational studies that identify
the husbands' lack of involvement as a main barrier for the uptake of
Lasee and Becker, 1997; Sharan and Valente, 2002;
contraceptives (see, e.g.,
Shattuck et al., 2011; Hartmann et al., 2012)
Journal of Development Economics 158 (2022) 102915
We find that involving the husband increases the likelihood that FPS
are chosen. Using a theoretical framework, we explore three different
mechanisms that can explain this result. First, we do not find evidence
of the husband having a stronger preference for FPS than the wife.
Second, we find that the positive effect of the husband's involvement
is driven by women who believe that their husband does not approve
of couples using contraceptives. This finding indicates that information
about spousal preferences is incomplete, which makes the effect of
the husband's involvement dependent on women's beliefs about their
husband's preferences. Finally, we also find that the wife is less certain
about whether the plan to attend a FP meeting will be carried out
successfully when the husband is not involved in the decision. This
would lower the expected value of the conditional payment when she
makes the decision alone, hence making it less attractive.
Using data collected after the experiment, we find that most couples
who needed to attend a FP meeting to receive a payment attended
such a meeting, without any difference across treatments. Furthermore,
once at the FP meeting, a majority of couples received contraceptives,
again without any difference across treatments. As we will explain in
more detail, both findings provide evidence against a potential social
desirability bias, which might have confounded the treatment effects.
Finally, using the treatments as instrumental variables, we find that the
condition to attend a FP meeting significantly increases contraceptive
use one month after the experiment.
Our paper contributes to two strands of literature. First, it relates
to the literature on household bargaining over fertility and contra-
ceptive use. Several studies focus on bargaining over the number of
children to have (Klawon and Tiefenthaler, 2001; Rasul, 2008; Kim and
Radoias, 2014; Hener, 2015; Doepke and Kindermann, 2019
). Some
experimental studies look at the effect of male involvement on the
uptake of contraceptives, on which they find mixed evidence (Fisek and
Sumbuloglu, 1978; Terefe and Larson, 1992; Wang et al., 1998; Ashraf
et al., 2014; McCarthy, 2019
). Our study differs from these studies
in at least two ways. We focus on the uptake of FPS offered by the
existing public health system. Moreover, we are particularly interested
in whether the involvement of the husband influences couples' plans to
use FPS.
Second, we relate to an emerging literature on incomplete infor-
mation within the household. While a growing number of studies
demonstrates that information asymmetries over income and choice
set matter for household decision-making (Castilla and Walker, 2013,
Munro et al., 2014; Hoel, 2015; Jakiela and Ozier, 2016), these papers
remain silent about the potential effect of incomplete information about
spousal preferences. A few studies, however, do provide evidence of in-
complete information about spousal preferences (Bateman and Munro,
2005; Afzal et al., 2018
), but remain silent about the consequences this
might have for household decision-making. When decisions are made
individually and without communication between spouses, decisions
are based on beliefs about spousal preferences, which might be inaccu-
rate. In this paper, we demonstrate empirically and theoretically how
such beliefs can interact with the effect of the husband's involvement
in household decisions.

2.1. Setting
We conducted our study in Tanzania, which has seen a steady
increase in the use of contraceptives by women aged 15—49, from 20%
in 2004-05 to 32% in 2015-16 (TNBS and Macro, 2016
). The unmet
need for FP, in contrast, has been at around 22% for two decades.
A variety of governmental and non-governmental organizations
have tried to increase the uptake of FPS in the country (e.g., USAID sup-
ported 17 organizations (
)). Tanzanian policy on FP and
USAID, 2018
contraceptive use aimed to increase modern contraceptive use to 45%
by 2020
(United Republic of Tanzania, 2016). In order to do so, one
of the objectives was to reduce demand-side constraints, by increasing
men's acceptability of FP. Multiple targets were used, of which the most
important ones include an increase in spousal communication, a change
of harmful gender norms to make FP the responsibility of both men
and women, and a reduction in gender-based violence which negatively
correlates with the use of contraceptives. Our focus on the involvement
of men in the decision-making process is very much in line with the
government's assessment and action plan.
For our study, we focus on the Lake zone of Tanzania, which has
the highest unmet need for FP in the country (30%). In this region, we
are interested in the rural population where contraceptive use tends
to be lower (TNBS and Macro, 2016). We selected Misungwi district,
which is located 47 kilometers south of Mwanza city and where ninety
percent live in rural settlements (
). Agriculture is the main
TNBS, 2015
economic activity in this district, followed by livestock keeping, small-
scale mining and petty trade of agricultural and livestock products. It
is ethnically very homogenous with most households belonging to the
Sukuma tribe, which is patrilineal. This makes that husbands tend to
have strong decision-making power in most household decisions.
2.2. Experimental task
To identify the effect of the husband's involvement on the use of
FPS, we experimentally varied the involvement of the husband in the
decision-making process. For this, we brought couples to a field lab
where they responded to financial incentives when deciding whether to
make use of FPS offered at their nearest health facility. The experiment
simulates this decision by asking couples to make a series of choices
between two options, A and B. Option B was only paid if the wife or
the couple had attended a family planning meeting before the payment
date, while option A did not have this condition. The chosen option was
paid out one month after the experiment. This captures an important
feature of the decision-making process, where a visit to the nearest
health center in rural areas requires planning. In other words, when
couples chose between the two options, they decided whether to plan
3
a visit to the health center.
We used a list of five pairs of choices, in which we kept option
A constant and gradually increased option B. The difference between
options A and B varied from -TZS 4,000 to +TZS 4,000 (approx. US$
1.8). We used a series of five pairs instead of only one pair to increase
variation among the couples, as several couples might switch their
choice from A to B within the series of pairs (see Table A. 1).
We used the FP meetings that local health facilities already orga-
nized every weekday. The participants were informed about when these
meetings took place (day and time) prior to making their decisions.
These meetings consist of two parts. In the first part, health staff
present information about health-related topics including the benefits
of FP and child nutrition. In the second part of the meeting, the
participants can attend an individual meeting with the nurse where they
are given information about different contraceptive methods and have
3 To avoid that the decisions might be confounded by potential liquidity
constraints or lack of trust that payments would be made in the future, option
A was paid at the same time as option B.

the opportunity to receive free contraceptives. These meetings are more
tailored to the individual needs than the first part which only contains
more general information. The conditionality imposed in B was only
satisfied if the participants attended the individual meeting.
2.3. Treatrnents
To test the effect of the husband's involvement on the uptake of FPS
offered at local health facilities, we organized three between-subject
treatments to which the couples were randomly allocated. In these
treatments, only the wife, only the husband or both spouses together
made the decisions, called "Wife Decision" (WD), "Husband Decision"
(HD), and "Joint Decision" (JD), respectively. We brought both spouses
to the experiment to ensure that spouses had the same information
about the action set. In this manner, the only element that differs
across the three between-subject treatments is who is involved in the
decision-making.
To ensure that the participants could freely choose the option
they preferred in the WD and HD treatments, we provided "plausible
deniability" of responsibility for any outcome in these treatments. In all
three between-subject treatments, the participants had a 9% probability
of getting a random outcome, i.e., where their decisions were made
irrelevant. In this way, it was difficult for the participant's spouse to
infer from the outcome what the participant's decisions were. This
procedure was clearly explained to all participants in the first half of
the explanations, where all couples were present, and before they knew
which treatment they were assigned to. The probability was the same
across all treatments but created plausible deniability only in WD and
HD since both spouses observed the decisions made in JD. While this
procedure does not entirely remove the pressure to align preferences
with their spouse — unless all participants are willing to lie to their
spouse about their decisions — we expect it to reduce some of this
4
pressure.
In addition to these between-subject treatments, we organized four
within-subject treatments where we varied the level of payments (high
or low) and who needed to attend the FP meeting (the wife only or
the wife and the husband together). We refer to the two latter within
dimensions as "Wife FPS" and "Couple FPS", respectively.5 In total,
participants made 20 decisions (see Table A.I in Appendix A). The
participants were told, that at the end of the experiment, we would
randomly select one outcome from their decisions and the "plausible
deniability option" for implementation.
2.4. Predictions
To develop predictions on the treatment differences in the likeli-
hood that option B is chosen, we use the following theoretical model.
Consider a household with two decision-makers, s e {w, h}, where w
represents the wife and h represents the husband. The household needs
Ashraf (2009
) who used a similar procedure to introduce plausible
deniability, with a probability of 11% to receive the random outcome.
5 The within-variation on who had to attend the FP meeting allows us
to analyze whether the between-subject treatment effects depend on this
dimension. This is important, as coordination costs could be larger where both
spouses need to attend the meeting. At the same time, having the husband
present at the meeting might be reassuring for the wife because she knows
that her husband approves of her receiving contraceptives. On the other
hand, it might also give the husband control over the decision to accept
contraceptives at the health facility. The variation of the payment level allows
us to test whether there are any income effects. More specifically, in half of
the decisions, we increased the payments in options A and B by TZS 4,000
(see pairs 6—10 and 16—20 in Table A.I in Appendix A). Adding variation in
payment levels allows us to disentangle an effect of increased cost/income
with the "Couple FPS" from the mere effect of having both spouses attend the
meeting.

to choose x e {A, B}. A is the payment they receive without needing
to attend a FP meeting and B is the payment that is conditional on
attending a FP meeting.
Spouse s has complete preferences over the two options that can be
represented by a personal utility function us (x). We allow for the spouses
to have caring preferences and define their ultimate utility function as:
Us(x) = (1
(1)
where O 0.5. We refer to as the "caring parameter". The
higher ys, the more spouse s takes his or her partner's preferences
(i.e., the partner's personal utility function, into account in their
ultimate utility function. is set to be equal to or lower than 0.5
as it is commonly assumed that people do not care more about their
spouse than about themselves (on this see, e.g., Browning et al. (2014))
Costs associated with attending the FP meeting, such as transport or
opportunity costs, are implicitly taken into account in the personal
utility functions where they reduce us(B). As these costs are orthogonal
to treatment, we do not discuss them further here.
We use the collective model as developed by
Chiappori (1988,
) where the household maximizes a weighted sum of the ultimate
1992
utility functions of both spouses. This model formalizes the notion of
bargaining power and shows how a change in bargaining power can
change the household decision outcome (Blundell et al., 2005) The
model thus allows us to predict the effect of including the husband in
the decision-making process, assuming that doing so would decrease
the wife's bargaining power in the household decision. The household
decision can be derived as the solution to:
max OUw(x) + (l —
(2)
where O O I is exogenously given and reflects the wife's bargaining
power in the household decision. We assume that the less we involve
the husband in the decision, the more bargaining power the wife has.
More specifically, O = I in WD, O = O in HD, and O O I in JD. Note
that when one of the spouses has all the bargaining power, the decision
only depends on his or her ultimate utility function.
In the following, we focus on the likelihood that B is chosen over A,
and how it changes with the wife's bargaining power, O. If the spouses
have the same preference ordering, there are no treatment differences.
If, however, the spouses have different preference orderings, an in-
crease in the wife's bargaining power will increase the likelihood that
her preferred option is chosen. This leads to the following predictions.
Prediction 1. If the spouses have the same preferences, there are no
treatment effects. Thus, WD = JD = HD.
Prediction 2. Ifthe spouses have different preferences, and the wife prefers
B (A) and the husband prefers A (B), the likelihood that B is chosen
weakly decreases (increases) with a larger involvement of the husband.
Thus, WD (S)JD 2 (S)HD.
2.5. Implementation
A few weeks before the experiment, we conducted a household sur-
vey with a sample of 750 couples from 30 hamlets, randomly selected
in Misungwi District, in Northern Tanzania.6 We interviewed both
6
In each selected hamlet, we selected a random sample of 40 couples
where the wife was below 40 years of age and had at least one living child. If
fewer than 40 couples were available in a hamlet, we selected all of them. We
included both couples who were married and couples who were living together
but were not married in our sample. Regardless of their marital status, we
use the terms "spouses", "husband" and "wife" when referring to them. The
experiment reported in this paper is part of a larger project on reproductive
health in Tanzania. The household survey is used in other articles, but the
Journal of Development Economics 158 (2022) 102915
spouses of each selected couple, separately and in private, to collect
general socio-demographic characteristics, and information on fertil-
ity preferences, contraceptive use and intra-household communication
about family planning. To conduct the interviews, we used same-gender
enumerator-interviewee pairs. We used these survey data to organize
the selection of the couples, test whether treatments were balanced
and undertake a heterogeneity analysis of the treatment effects. We
excluded all couples where the wife was pregnant when they completed
the survey or where either the husband or the wife reported to be
infecund.
Each experimental session was organized in exactly the same way.
Couples were convened at a central location (e.g., a classroom or
a community center in the hamlet), and the spouses were seated
apart to avoid communication with each other or any other partic-
ipant. We started each session with some general information about
how the experiment would be conducted (no talking, no phones, in-
formed consent, anonymity, etc.). Then the couples went through a
non-incentivized task to elicit their individual time preferences. There-
after, we provided information about the main task, as well as the
content of the FP meetings. Couples were then randomly allocated to
one of the three treatments (WD, JD, or HD) and called one at a time to
make the decisions in private with an enumerator. Here, we again used
same-gender enumerator-interviewee pairs. In WD we had one female
enumerator, in HD we used one male enumerator, and in JD we used
one female and one male enumerator. For the detailed experimental
instructions see Appendix D.
To test the participants' understanding of the instructions, the enu-
merator asked a set of control questions for decision pairs 1—10 and
11—20. Specifically, respondents were asked which option required
them to attend a FP meeting, who needed to attend the meeting, who
was paid, and what would happen at the FP meeting. If the participants
answered incorrectly, an additional short explanation was given. After
having gone through all control questions, the enumerator recorded
whether they thought the participant had a sufficient understanding
of the task. 92% were thought to have a sufficient understanding.
Each spouse received a TZS 5,000 show-up fee (approx. US$ 2.3)
and had the opportunity to earn more during the experiment. On
average, each couple earned TZS 19,600 (approx. US$ 9) including the
show-up fee, corresponding to about one week's worth of household
income. The show-up fee was paid on the day of the experiment, while
the remaining payment was paid one month later.
After all decisions were made, we privately asked participants how
likely they thought it was that they would attend a FP meeting, that
their spouse would attend the meeting, and that they would ask for con-
traceptives at the meeting, if option B was selected for payment. These
questions were asked of all decision-makers (wife in WD, husband in
7
HD, and both in JD) regardless of the decision they had made.
At the end of the experiment, we randomly selected one outcome
from the 20 decisions and the "plausible deniability option" for pay-
ment. If a decision was selected in which B was chosen, the wife was
given a form that had to be completed and signed by the nurse at
the closest health center (the participants were informed about which
health center they should attend at the beginning of the session). We
used this to verify whether the payment condition of option B was
fulfilled (see Appendix D.2 for an illustration of the form). To ensure
that it was the woman (or couple) that participated in the experiment
that attended the FP meeting, the nurse filled out the name of the
results from the experiment are only reported here. As one of the purposes
of the project was to study the use of reproductive health services (maternal
health care, pre-natal and post-natal care), the women interviewed needed to
have at least one living child.
7 Note that due to the procedure followed to ensure "plausible deniability"
all respondents face a non-zero chance that option B is selected, even the
respondents who always chose option A.

woman who attended, and the name of her husband if he joined her.
When we paid the participant one month after the experimental session,
we checked whether the name on the form corresponded with the name
of the participant who was given the form. To do this check, we used
the second part of the form that was completed and retained by the
nurse.
The second part of the form also included some questions on the
uptake of contraceptives which were answered by the nurse. In ad-
dition, when we revisited women to give their payments, we asked
them some questions in private about their uptake of contraceptives. In
this way, we collected data on whether the FP meeting was attended,
whether contraceptives were taken up at the meeting (reported by
nurses at the health facilities and the participants), and if so which type
of contraceptive (reported by the nurse).
We revisited each hamlet one month after the experimental session
to make the individual payments to the participants. For this, we used
the following procedure. If one of the decision pairs 1 to 10 (see Table
A. 1) was chosen (i.e., only the wife was paid), only the wife was invited
to come and receive the payment. If one of the decision pairs 11 to 20
was chosen (i.e, both spouses were paid), both spouses were invited
to come and receive the payment. If only one of the spouses showed
up, he or she would receive the payments of both spouses. Payments
were always made in private. With the "Couple FPS", however, spouses
would always receive the same payment and hence could infer each
other's payment.
3. Results
In this section, we first describe the sample before presenting the
main treatment effects.
3.1. The sample
In total, we organized 51 experimental sessions in 30 hamlets. 14
health facilities were involved in the study. They were located between
15 min and 2 h driving (by motorbike) away from the hamlets, as
estimated by local hamlet leaders. 673 couples were invited to the
experiment, of which 525 couples participated (78% show-up rate).
We do not find any significant differences in observable characteristics
between couples that participated and couples that did not participate
in the experiment (see Table A.2 in Appendix A).8
Table 1
presents a balance test of important characteristics of the
participants by treatment. As can be seen, the treatments are well-
balanced in terms of observable characteristics. Panel A reports socio-
demographic characteristics. The husbands are generally older and
have more years of education than the wives. The couples have, on
average, three children aged 12 or younger. The proportion of Catholics
is higher among the wives while the proportion of respondents without
any religion is higher among the husbands. About 40% of women and
55% of men are employed outside of the household, and 10% of women
and 20% of men are self-employed. Nearly 80% of women and 90% of
men had been growing agricultural crops in the last season. The most
common crops were maize, followed by sweet potatoes, cassava, and
rice. More than 70% of the households own cattle or pack animals or
smaller animals (such as sheep, goats, and rabbits). Most respondents
belong to the Sukuma tribe (more than 96%).
8 With 449 couples we interviewed both spouses, while with 52 couples
we only interviewed the wife and with 24 couples we only interviewed the
husband. The participants who did not take part in the household survey were
asked for some basic information after the experimental session (including age,
education and religion). In total, 18 women and 41 men were interviewed in
this way.
Journal of Development Economics 158 (2022) 102915
Panel B reports statistics on fertility preferences. About 20% of men
and 30% of women do not want to have any more children.9 Among
the respondents who want to have more children, most of them want to
wait at least two years before having another child. Thus, the need for
family planning is high.10 On average, men and women want to have
six children (with a median of 6 for women and 5 for men).
We find considerable within-couple differences in fertility prefer-
ences. In 26% of the couples, one of the spouses does not want more
children while the other either wants more children or is undecided (in
8.5% of the couples the husband does not want more children while
the wife wants more or is undecided, and in 17.9% of the couples the
wife does not want more children, while the husband wants more or is
undecided). Furthermore, of the couples where both spouses want more
children, 37% disagree about when to have the next child. 20.0% are
couples where the husband wants to delay the next child by at least
2 years and the wife does not, and 16.9% are couples where the wife
wants to delay the next child by at least 2 years and the husband does
not.
Panel C displays current use of contraceptives (see Table A. 3 in
Appendix A for past and intended use of contraceptives). We present
information on the use of modern contraceptives and the use of long-
acting reversible contraceptives (LARC).II 26.5% of the wives report
using modern contraceptives and 7.5% use LARC. This is 16.5 percent-
age points higher than the percentage of couples where the husband
reported that they used modern contraceptives. In other words, in only
38% of the couples where the wife reports using modern contracep-
tives, the husband also reports using modern contraceptives. Among
these couples, 24% of the women report that the husband does not
know that they are using contraceptives. Thus intentional hiding of
contraceptive use does not seem to drive all the reporting differences
between men and women.
Of the women who are not currently using contraceptives, 8% used
modern contraceptives (2% used LARC) in the past and 46.5% believe
that they will use contraceptives in the future (15.6% plan to use
LARC and 5% to sterilize). Interestingly, while fewer men plan to use
contraceptives in the future (26.4%), more men than women plan to
do a sterilization (10.4%). For more details, see Table A.3 in Appendix
Panel D presents statistics on within-couple communication about
FP and beliefs about the spouse's opinion on contraceptives. In 43%
of the couples, both spouses reported that they discussed FP with each
other. 54.7% of the women and 47.9% of the men believe that their
spouse approves of contraceptives, while 24.4% of the women and 11%
of the men believe that their spouse disapproves.
9 This is in line with the recent Demographic and Health survey (
2016) In
the Lake region (both urban and rural pooled), to which our study region
belongs, 29.5% of currently married women aged 15—49 and 21.8% of all
currently married men do not want any more children.
10 We define someone to have a need for family planning if the respondent
does not want any more children or wants to wait at least two years before
having more children.
11 The participants are asked whether they themselves or their spouse are
doing something or using any method to delay or avoid getting pregnant. We
define "modern contraceptives" as contraceptives that give women a reliable
means to control their fertility. These methods include the pill, injectables,
intrauterine devices (IUD), implants, and sterilization. We do not include male
condoms as women are often unable to enforce their use. If we had included
condoms in modern contraceptives, 35% of women would report using modern
contraceptives. LARCs include IUDs and implants. We allowed couples who
already used modern contraceptives to participate in the experiment because
it might still be interesting for them to attend the FP meeting. For example, a
couple might want to obtain better information about contraceptives, or simply
receive an updated checkup by the nurse; or a woman who uses contraceptives
without her husband being aware might want to convince him that using
contraceptives is a good thing to do.

Note: The table displays sample averages for each characteristic. "H" refers to the husband and "W" to the wife. "FP" is an abbreviation for "family planning". "Need for FP" is
an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the respondent either does not want more children or wants to wait at least two years before having another child. "Use modern FP"
takes the value 1 if the respondent reports using the pill, injectables, IUDS, or implants. LARC is an abbreviation for "long-acting reversible contraception" and includes implants
and IUDs. "Employed" takes the value 1 if the respondent reports having worked for someone else in the past 12 months, including on someone else's farm, business or for an
organization or company (such as school, government and bank). "Self-employed" takes the value 1 if the respondent reports running a business other than farming (such as a
shop, fishing, driver, and builder). The total number of observations is 525. Some variables include only a sub-sample: "Want to wait to years or more" includes participants that
want more children. The last column presents the two-sided p-value of an ANOVA. The joint x2-statistics is from a multinomial regression using the Treatment as the dependent
variable and the characteristics as independent variables.
Panel C in Table A.3 in Appendix A shows that 61% of the women
and 27.5% of the men reported ever discussing FP with a nurse at a
health center. Of these, 83.1% of the women and 70.8% of the men
had the discussion in the past year, and most are either completely or
somewhat satisfied with the services they received. Even if a substantial
proportion of women discussed FP at the health center, many of them
in the past year, only 26.5% of them are using modern contraceptives
and the unmet need for FP remains high. One of the most commonly
cited reasons for not using contraceptives is fear of side effects (29%).
Moreover, there is a lack of knowledge about FP among both men and
women. As an example, 34% of women and 61% of men do not know
whether injectables are effective in avoiding pregnancy, and nearly
20% of both men and women believe that the pill causes infertility
(for more details, see Table A.4 in Appendix A). This suggests that
neither women nor men have sufficient knowledge about FP and are
in need of more information before they would start or continue using
contraceptives.
3.2. Main treatment effects
To investigate the effect of the husband's involvement on the
likelihood that FPS are chosen, we estimate the following regression:

where yc is the proportion of the 20 decisions where couple c chose
FPS (henceforth referred to as "proportion"). a is a constant and (JD)c
and (HD)c are treatment indicator variables taking the value 1 if
couple c was assigned to JD and HD, respectively. WD is used as the
base treatment. ps captures session-fixed effects, Xc is a set of control
variables and E c is the error term.

Notes: The table reports OLS regressions. Dependent variable: the proportion of
decisions where family planning services (FPS) are chosen. Independent variables: "JD"
(indicator variable taking the value 1 for couples in Joint Decision) and "HD" (indicator
variable taking the value 1 for couples in Husband Decision). "Session fixed effects"'
indicator variables used for each of the sessions of the experiment. "Socio-economic
controls" include age, education and religion of both spouses, a wealth index, and
the number of children. "Fertility controls" include the use of modern contraceptives,
whether the husband has a need for FP, whether the wife has a need for FP, whether
the husband and wife both report to have discussed family planning in the past year,
whether the husband believes that their wife approves of contraceptive use, whether
the wife believes that their husband approves of contraceptive use. Standard errors

session fixed effects, socio-economic controls, and fertility controls.13
We find that involving the husband significantly increases the pro-
portion of the decisions where FPS are chosen and that this effect is
robust across the different specifications. The proportion is 11.7—13.4
percentage points higher in HD than in WD and is 9.7—11.4 percentage
points higher in JD than in WD. There is no difference in the proportion
between the two treatments where the husband is involved.
To test the robustness of these results, we undertake the following
additional analyses. First, the results are robust across the different
within-subject treatments, as shown in Table A.5 in Appendix A.
14
Second, they are also robust to only including couples with a sufficient
understanding of the task and who do not switch more than once
(see Table A.6 in Appendix A).15 It even increases the point estimates
and the statistical significance of the effects. Third, even though the
estimates are very similar when we add controls, it should be noted that
adding controls reduces the sample by 15% (from 525 to 431 couples).
One might therefore wonder whether removing the couples for which
we do not have background information influences the estimates. To
obtain an idea of whether that might be the case, we remove the
controls from the regression in column (4) in Table 2. The results are
presented in column (5) of Table A.6 in Appendix A and are again
very similar. Fourth, 9% of the couples in our sample are polygamous
13 Distance to the nearest health center might matter, as they determine
travel costs. The session fixed effects we include in the regressions control
for distance to the health center, because all participants in a session were
recruited from the same hamlet.
14 A comparison of the within-subject treatments (see Table A.8 in Appendix
A) shows that (i) in the high payment condition, the effect of the husband's
involvement is stronger when both spouses need to attend the FP meeting,
and (ii) in the condition where only the wife needs to attend the FP meeting
("Wife FPS"), the effect of the husband's involvement is weaker in the high
payment condition.
15 7%—10% of the couples switched more than once in a price list, and 92%
of the couples had a sufficient understanding. As can be seen in Table A.3 in
Appendix A, there are no differences in understanding and multiple switching
across treatments.
Journal of Development Economics 158 (2022) 102915
(evenly distributed across treatments, p > 0.764 from F-test, see Table
A.3 in Appendix A). As polygamous and monogamous couples might
behave differently, it is important to test whether the results are influ-
enced by the inclusion of polygamous couples. Column (4) in Table A.6
in Appendix A shows the regression results with monogamous couples
only. The results are again robust. Finally, we add experimenter fixed
effects in Table A.7 in Appendix A. As different enumerators were used
in the WD and HD treatments (only female enumerators were involved
in WD, and only male enumerators were involved in HD), we cannot
control for experimenter effects for the comparison between WD and
HD. However, as all enumerators were involved in JD, we can control
for experimenter effects for the pairwise comparisons between JD and
each of the other treatments. As can be seen from Table A.7 in Appendix
A, the results remain robust.
4. Mechanisms
So far, we found that involving the husband increases the likelihood
that FPS are chosen. This result indicates that > Uh(A)) >
> Uw(A)). In this section, we explore potential mechanisms
that might explain why women and men evaluate options A and
B differently. More specifically, the positive effect of involving the
husband can be driven by one of the following mechanisms:
1. The husband gets more personal utility from FPS than his wife.
2. The wife incorrectly believes that her husband disapproves of
contraceptives.
3. The wife expects that the plan to use FPS is less likely to be
fulfilled when the husband is not involved.
In the rest of this section, we will look for supporting evidence on
each of the three mechanisms. We will also develop our theoretical
model to incorporate the role of beliefs about spousal preferences
(second mechanism) and uncertainty about whether the FP meeting
16
will be attended (third mechanism).
4.1. Does the husband have a stronger preference for FPS?
Involving the husband in the decision could increase the likelihood
that FPS are chosen if the husband gets more personal utility from FPS
than his wife. Recall that the ultimate utility function is defined as
Us = (l — + Thus, involving the husband increases the
likelihood that B is chosen, if uh(B) > uw(B).
To find evidence for this mechanism, we look into three possible
sources of spousal differences in FPS preferences: (i) fertility prefer-
ences, awareness of contraceptive use, and unmet need for FP, (ii)
knowledge about FP, and (iii) hyperbolic time preferences. We explore
each of them in turn.
4.1.1. Fertility preferences, awareness of contraceptive use, and unmet FP
need
It is plausible that if an individual has a need for family planning
(i.e., does not want more children or wants to delay having more
children), this individual is more likely to prefer FPS. In our sample,
we observe important differences in fertility preferences between men
and women. As reported in
more women than men do not want
Table 1,
more children. There are also important within-couple differences. In
26% of the couples in our sample, one of the spouses (in 17.8% this is
the husband) does not want more children while the other does or is
undecided. In couples where both spouses want more children, there
is also important heterogeneity in how long they want to wait with
getting the next child.
16 Some of the analyses in this section were not pre-specified in our pre-
analysis plan. The idea of inaccurate beliefs is discussed in Appendix A.I. of
the pre-analysis plan.

Notes: The table reports OLS regressions with session fixed effects. Dependent variable:
the proportion of decisions in which family planning services (FPS) are chosen.
Independent variables: treatment variables "JD" and "HD", and the set of control
variables as defined in
Table 2.
Note that columns (1) and (3) do not include
controls for spousal fertility preferences and column (2) does not include controls for
contraceptive use. "Var" is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the husband has
weaker fertility preferences than the wife in column (1), if the husband is not aware
of the wife using modern contraceptives in column (2), and if the husband has an
unmet need for FP and the wife does not in column (3). "JD X Var" is the interaction
term between the treatment indicator variable Joint Decision and "Var". "HD X Var"
is the interaction term between the treatment indicator variable Husband Decision and
"Var". Standard errors clustered at the session level in parentheses. For the extended
table, see Table B.2 in Appendix B.
* p < 0.10, ** p < 0.05, *** p < 0.01.
a: mean in Wife Decision (WD) when "var" is set to O.
Within-couple differences in fertility preferences might translate
into within-couple differences in preferences for FPS. For example, the
husband might have a stronger preference for FPS than his wife if he
has weaker fertility preferences than his wife, e.g., when the husband
does not want another child while the wife does. If the positive effect of
the involvement of the husband is driven by the husband's preference
for FPS, we should find that this effect is stronger among couples where
the husband has a weaker fertility preference (than his wife) than
among couples where the spouses have the same fertility preferences
or the wife has weaker fertility preferences than her husband.
To test this, we interact the treatment variables with spousal pref-
erence differences. The results are reported in column (1) in
Table 3.
In this column, "Var" takes the value one if the husband has a need for
family planning while the wife does not (15% of the couples). "Var"
is zero whenever the husband and the wife have the same preferences
or the wife has weaker fertility preferences than the husband. First, we
note that if the husband does not have weaker fertility preferences than
his wife, involving the husband still increases the likelihood that FPS
are chosen (as can be seen by the positive and significant coefficients
on "JD" and "HD"). If the husband has weaker fertility preferences, the
treatment differences become larger (but not significantly so). Thus,
differences in fertility preferences do not appear to be driving the
treatment differences.
The link between the husband's fertility preferences and his pref-
erence for FPS could depend on whether he is aware that his wife
already uses modern contraceptives.
Table 1
shows that husbands —
compared to their wife — are less likely to report that they use modern
contraceptives. This implies that even where spouses have the same fer-
tility preferences, the husband may have a stronger preference for FPS
than the wife if he does not know that they are using contraceptives.
To test whether this could explain the positive effect of the husband's
involvement in the decision, we interact the treatment variables with
the husband's unawareness of contraceptive use (in column (2) in
Table 3
). The husband's unawareness of contraceptive use is defined
as an indicator variable taking the value one if the wife reports using
Journal of Development Economics 158 (2022) 102915
modern contraceptives while the husband does not, zero otherwise.
This is the case in 16% of the couples. If the husband's unawareness of
contraceptive use is driving our results, we would expect the interaction
Table 3
to be positive and significant. As can be seen, the
terms in
interaction term with JD is negative, and the interaction term with
HD is far from significant, suggesting that the husband's awareness of
contraceptive use is not driving the results.
A third factor that might influence the treatment effects is the
husband's unmet need for FP which combines his fertility preferences
and awareness of contraceptive use. In particular, if the husband has an
unmet need for FP while the wife does not (either because of differences
in fertility preferences or different reporting of contraceptive use),
involving the husband might increase the uptake of FPS. In
Table 3,
"unmet need for FP" is an indicator variable taking the value one if
the husband has an unmet need for FP while the wife does not (22% of
couples), zero otherwise. We again expect the interaction terms to be
positive and significant if these couples are driving the results. As can
be seen, this is not the case, suggesting that this factor does not drive
the positive effect of the husband's involvement.
4.1.2. Knowledge about FP
Men might have lower knowledge about the benefits and costs of
FP than their wives. This is in line with, e.g., Ashraf et al. (2020
) who
showed that men have lower knowledge about reproductive health risks
(mostly related to labor and delivery outcomes) than women. If men
have a need for knowledge, their lower knowledge might translate into
a stronger preference for FPS, where knowledge can be obtained.
To test whether this mechanism explains the positive effect of the
husband's involvement, we use data from the survey, in which we
asked the respondents a set of "knowledge" questions about FP. These
questions range from the efficacy of contraceptives to pregnancy risks
(see Table A.4 in Appendix A). For each statement, a relatively large
fraction of both women and men answer that they do not know whether
the statement is true or not. 65% of women and 83% of men answer
"do not know" on at least one of the five statements. Women are
significantly less likely to give this answer than men (1.6 times vs. 2.2
times, p < 0 001 from a two-sided t-test).
To investigate whether the lack of knowledge about FP influences
the treatment effects, we interact the treatments with the difference in
knowledge between the husband and the wife. If lack of knowledge is
driving the treatment effects, we expect small or no treatment differ-
ences when the husband has an equal or larger amount of knowledge
about FP than the wife. Further, we expect the interaction terms to be
positive and significant, which would indicate that husbands with less
knowledge about FP are driving the results.
Table 4
displays the results.
In column (1), we interact the treatment variables with an indicator
variable taking the value one if the husband answers "do not know"
more frequently than the wife (55% of couples). In column (2), we use
the difference in "do not know" answers between the husband and the
wife when the husband answers "do not know" more frequently than
the wife (it is zero otherwise). The average difference is 1.2 questions
(with a standard deviation of 1.4). As can be seen, neither of the
interaction terms are significant, suggesting that a lack of knowledge
is not driving the results.
4.1.3. Hyperbolic time preferences
As option B is conditional on attending a FP meeting at the local
health center, it can be used as a commitment device. This implies that
the husband might have a stronger preference for FPS if he benefits
more from its use as a commitment device than his wife. To test this, we
look at the participants' time preferences. It has been demonstrated that
people might have a preference for commitment if they have hyperbolic
time preferences, i.e. they are more patient in the future than in the
present (see , e.g., Ashraf et al., 2006).
We elicit time preferences by asking the participants to choose
between a hypothetical smaller reward the day after the experiment

mean in Wife Decision (WD) when "var" is set to O.
or a larger reward after one month (referred to as "near time" frame).
The same question was also asked for a "later time" frame (six versus
seven months) to identify potential reversals in time preferences (see
Section D.3 of the Appendix for more details). We define an individual
to have hyperbolic time preferences if the estimated discount rate is
higher in the near time frame than the later time frame.
We do not find any gender differences in discount rates. On average,
husbands and wives have a discount rate of 9.8% and 10.3%, respec-
tively, in the nearer time frame, (p-value from two-sided t-test 0.394).
In the later time frame, women are slightly more patient than men with
a monthly discount rate of 8.8% and 9.7%, respectively (p-value from
two-sided t-test 0.063). More women than men display hyperbolic time
preferences (30.5% vs 25.0%, respectively; two-sided t-test p = 0.049).
If participants used option B as a commitment device, we should
find that the proportion of decisions where FPS is chosen is higher
among the participants with hyperbolic time preferences. We test this in
columns (1)-(3) in
Table 5.
As can be seen, the coefficients are negative
and not significant, indicating that the choice of FPS is not used as
a commitment device in the individual treatments. Therefore, we do
not expect that a difference in hyperbolic time preferences between
the husband and the wife influences the treatment differences. This
is indeed what we find in column (4). Given that we are looking
for a mechanism behind the positive effect of husband's involvement
on the choice of FPS, we focus on the case where the husband has
hyperbolic time preferences and the wife has not. As can be seen by the
insignificant interaction terms, this is not driving the treatment effects.
4.2. Inaccurate beliefs
The second explanation for the positive effect of the husband's
involvement assumes that women have inaccurate beliefs about their
husband's preferences for FP. In patriarchal societies in low-income
countries, FP is often a contentious topic, which might generate spousal
disagreement or even conflict. This makes it difficult for women to
initiate a conversation about this topic (Mosha et al., 2013; Amo-
Adjei et al., 2017
). As a result, there tends to be little discussion or
communication among spouses about FP. In Panel D of Table 1, we
Notes: The table reports OLS regressions with session fixed effects. Dependent variable:

Independent variables: treatment variables "JD" and "HD", the set of control variables
as defined in Table 2, and the wife's discount rates in the near and later time frame
(columns (1), (3), and (4)) and the husband's discount rates in the near and later time
frame (columns (2)—(4)). "Hyperbolic, W" is an indicator variable taking the value 1
if the wife has a higher discount rate in the near time frame than in the later time
frame. "Hyperbolic, H" is defined correspondingly for the husband. "H hyperbolic, W
not" is an indicator variable taking the value 1 if the husband has hyperbolic time
preferences while the wife does not. "JD X H hyper. , W not" is the interaction term
between the treatment indicator variable Joint Decision and "H hyperbolic, W not".
"HD X H hyper. , W not" is the interaction term between the treatment indicator variable
Husband Decision and "H hyperbolic, W not". Standard errors clustered at the session
level in parentheses. For extended table, see Table B.4 in Appendix B. * p < 0.10, *

. mean in Wife Decision (WD) when "Hyperbolic, W" = O in column (1), mean in
Husband Decision (HD) when "Hyperbolic, H" = O in column (2), mean in Joint
Decision (JD) when "Hyperbolic, W" = O and "Hyperbolic, H" = O in column (3),
mean in "WD" when "H hyperbolic, W not" = O in column (4).
see that only 43% of the couples reported that they discussed FP with
their partner in the past year. This could make beliefs about spousal
preferences inaccurate.
To see how the treatment predictions change when the wife has
inaccurate beliefs about her husband's preferences, we rewrite the
wife's ultimate utility function in Eq.
Uw(x) = (1
- + 7wEueuuh(x)
(4)
where E is the expectation operator over a set U of utility functions for
h. We assume that incomplete information is only a problem when the
decision is made individually by the wife, as there is no communication
between the spouses. In JD, in contrast, both spouses will get to know
each other's preferences as they make the decision together.
When discussing beliefs, we refer to beliefs about the personal
preference ordering of the spouse. If the wife has inaccurate beliefs,
it means that she believes that the husband gets more personal utility
from A than B, while the opposite is true. As long as Eueuuh(B) < uh(B),
having inaccurate beliefs lowers the likelihood that the wife chooses
B. Thus, if there is no conflict in the household, inaccurate beliefs
might lead to Pareto-dominated choices when the decision is made
individually. For example, if us(B) > us(A) for both spouses, but the
wife has inaccurate beliefs, the likelihood that B is chosen is lower
when the decision is made by the wife than when it is made jointly
or by the husband (assuming that he has accurate beliefs). In this case,
if inaccurate beliefs lead the wife to choose A instead of B, both spouses
would have been better off if the decision had been B.
Thus, the theory shows that if the wife incorrectly expects her
husband to prefer A, involving the husband increases the likelihood

the use of contraceptives. Even though this is not a measure of the
wife's beliefs about their husband's preferences over options A and B,
there is a clear link between attending a FP meeting and the use of
contraceptives (the couples need to attend such a meeting to receive
free contraceptives). Therefore, we use this measure as a proxy for the
17
wives' beliefs about their husband's preferences over the two options.
Overall, as shown in
55% of the women in our sample believe
Table 1,
that their husband approves of contraceptives, and 24% believe that
their husband disapproves. The remaining category includes women
who either do not know or believe that the spouse is indifferent.
If women's beliefs are behind the positive effect of the husband's
involvement, we should find that this effect is strongest among couples
where the wife believes that her husband disapproves of contraceptives.
To test this, we interact the treatment variables with women's beliefs.
Table 6
displays the results. We report results for the overall proportion
of decisions where FPS are chosen in column (1), the proportion for
"Wife FPS" (i.e., where only the wife had to attend a FP meeting) in
column (2), and the proportion for "Couple FPS" (i.e., where both the
wife and the husband had to attend a FP meeting) in column (3). We
report the results for each condition separately, to verify whether the
effects differ between both conditions.
Two findings are worth noting. First, the coefficients of "JD" and
"HD" are positive and statistically significant in all columns. This
17 The question asked whether they thought that their spouse agreed with
couples in general using contraceptives. In this way, we avoided that they had
to think about their own relationship, which might bias reporting. Moreover,
we did not ask directly about their beliefs about their spouse's preference
over options A and B because this could either bias their decisions in the
experiment if we elicited these beliefs before the decisions were made, or the
beliefs themselves could be biased if we elicited them after the decisions were
made.
Journal of Development Economics 158 (2022) 102915
indicates that among couples where the wife does not believe that her
husband approves of contraceptives, involving the husband increases
the proportion of decisions where FPS are chosen. In JD, the proportion
is between 21.1 and 26.0 percentage points higher than in WD, and
in HD, the proportion is 22—23 percentage points higher. Second, the
coefficients of the interaction terms "JD X Beliefs" and "HD X Beliefs"
are negative and statistically significant. This indicates that the differ-
ences between the WD treatment and each of the other treatments are
significantly smaller when the wife believes that her husband approves
18
of contraceptives.
These results suggest that women incorrectly believe that their
husband disapproves of contraceptives, which makes women less likely
to choose FPS if their husband is not involved in the decision. Note
that we do not have data on the true preferences of each spouse, and
can therefore not directly test whether beliefs are accurate. However,
we do have data on the desired number of children of each spouse
as well as their beliefs about the desired number of children of their
spouse. We expect that the desired number of children correlates closely
with preferences about options A and B.19 We find that in 57% of the
couples, the wife reports not knowing how many children her husband
wants, and out of the couples where the wife does report how many
children she thinks her husband wants, she overestimates the number
in 43% of the couples. Moreover, among the couples where the wife
makes an estimate on how many children her husband wants, there is
a negative correlation between the number of children she believes her
spouse wants and whether she believes her spouse approves of contra-
ceptives (spearman's p = —0.266, p = 0 001). Both observations taken
together suggest that women's beliefs about their spouse's approval of
contraceptives are downward biased, as we assumed when interpreting
the regression results above.
In sum, these observations together with the significant interaction
terms in the regressions support that the positive effect of the hus-
band's involvement is driven by women's inaccurate beliefs about their
husband's preferences.
4.3. The wife's expected utility of B
Our model so far ignored any possible actions taken after the
experiment. However, it might be that our participants anticipated
any post-experimental actions when making their decisions in the lab.
The third and last mechanism that we explore assumes that the wife's
expected utility of option B, Euw(B), might be lower in WD than in
the other treatments because she anticipates post-experimental actions.
Note that this is different from the previous mechanism where we as-
sumed there was certainty about the utility of option B and uncertainty
20
about the husband's preferences.
18 In
Table 6,
the "Wife's beliefs" indicator variable takes the value O either
if the wife believes that the husband disapproves of contraceptives, or if she
does not know. As a robustness test, we do the same analysis only with couples
where the wife either believes that the husband approves or disapproves. As
can be seen in Table A. 9 in Appendix A, the results are robust.
19 The main reason why we did not use beliefs about the desired number of
children in the regression is that in 57% of the couples, the wife reported not
knowing the husband's preferences, making it difficult to compare with the
husband's reported number of children.
20 This bears some resemblance to a potential "undoing problem", which
complicates intra-household experiments (
In many couple
Munro, 2018
experiments there is a risk that decisions can be undone after the experiment.
For example, a husband who disagrees with the decisions made by their wife
can reallocate economic resources received in an experiment. That husbands
can claim transfers from their wife is supported by Anderson and Baland
) who document how women use local saving groups to protect savings
(2002
from their husband's claims. It is important to clarify that while the decisions
made in our lab experiment cannot be undone, some actions taken after the
experiment can change the utility of options A and B.
10

Specifically, if option B is chosen, it is possible that the husband
does not allow their wife to attend the FP meeting or does not join their
wife when this is a condition, i.e. with the couple FPS. In that case, they
do not receive any payment, and option B becomes less attractive. The
perceived likelihood that the conditionality is fulfilled is reduced in the
WD treatment as women are often unable to make decisions on their
own about their mobility or have limited access to resources. Note that
these are typical measures of women's empowerment and bargaining
Malapit et al., 2019; Bandiera et al., 2020).21 For example, in
power (
our sample, only 10% of the women can decide alone whether to visit
their family or friends. If women have limited mobility and access to
resources, their expected utility of B might be lower in WD, since they
would have to negotiate with their husband to use household resources
or leave the house to visit the local health center.
In our model, this would be captured as follows. Assume that the
wife assigns probability O p I that she attends the FP meeting
and probability (l — p) that she does not. Then, the expected utility
from choosing option B, assuming that she obtains no utility if the
conditionality is not fulfilled, is:
Euw(B) = puw(B) + (1 - = puw(B)
This implies that a lower expectation that the conditionality is
fulfilled leads to a lower likelihood that option B is chosen. When the
decision is made jointly in JD we assume that the likelihood that the
conditionality is fulfilled, if B is chosen, is higher than in WD. This is
the case, as the husband would not choose option B if he was unwilling
to approve women's mobility or the use of household resources needed
to visit the health center and thus fulfill the conditionality.
To obtain an idea of the expectation that the conditionality is
fulfilled, we asked the participants how likely it was that they would
attend a FP meeting if option B was selected for payment. At that point,
participants had made all decisions but the selection of the decision
was not made yet, hence the participants did not know yet whether
they would need to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment. All
participants who made a decision (i.e. women only in WD, men only in
HD, and both spouses in JD) answered this question, even the ones who
never chose option B. Note that the plausible deniability mechanism we
used made these participants face a non-zero chance that they would
need to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment.
To elicit the individual expectation that the conditionality would be
fulfilled, we asked whether it was "very unlikely", "unlikely", "neither
unlikely nor likely", "likely", or "very likely" that (i) the wife and (ii)
the husband would attend the FP meeting if option B was chosen for
payment. In the following, we have converted these alternatives into
a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 indicates "very unlikely" and 5 "very
likely". The elicited beliefs are highly correlated with the choice of FPS
(Spearman's p > 0.5, p < 0.001 for both types of conditionalities).
In general, the expectation that the conditionality will be fulfilled is
high with most respondents finding it likely or very likely that they will
attend the FP meeting if option B was chosen for payment.
Table 7
tests
whether the expectations differ between WD and JD, and between HD
and JD for women's and men's beliefs, respectively. First, we observe
that the husband's beliefs do not vary between treatments. For the
wife's beliefs, there is no difference in expectations when only she needs
to attend the FP meeting ("Wife FPS"). If both the wife and the husband
need to attend the FP meeting ("Couple FPS"), we find that the wife's
expectations about the husband's attendance are significantly higher in
21
Women's empowerment and bargaining power can be measured in several
ways. The DHS typically focuses on household decision-making, including
whether the woman can decide whether to visit family and friends. The
Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI) is a standardized measure
of women's empowerment that includes the productive sphere in agricultural
settings. Access to resources is part of this index. For a review of measures of
bargaining power and empowerment, see

Notes: The table reports OLS regressions with session fixed effects. Dependent variable:
the reported belief on a scale from 1 to 5 about whether the wife or the husband
will attend the family planning (FP) meeting if option B is chosen for payment for
"Wife FPS" (where only the wife has to attend the FP meeting, columns (1)—(2)) and
"Couple FPS" (where both the wife and the husband have to attend the FP meeting,
columns (3)—(4)). Panel A shows the wife's beliefs with Wife Decision (WD) as base

JD than in WD (p = 0.031). This indicates that the uncertainty about
fulfilling the conditionality of the "Couple FPS" is larger in WD than in
JD. This might reduce the likelihood that the wife chooses FPS in WD
compared to JD and HD. However, as there are no differences between
treatments in expectations for "Wife FPS", it is unlikely that uncertainty
about the attendance of the FP meeting can explain the full treatment
effects.
The expected utility of option B may also be lower for women who
suffer from intimate partner violence (IPV), especially if they believe
that there is a chance that the husband may become violent if she
committed herself to visit the health center (by choosing option B)
without consulting him. Table A. 10 in Appendix A shows that being
subjected to IPV does not affect the treatment differences.
5. Attendance of FP meeting and contraceptive use
In this section, we extend the analysis by looking at behavior after
the decisions are made in the lab. Specifically, we test (i) whether the
FP meeting is attended and whether contraceptives are chosen at the FP
meeting if option B is chosen for payment and (ii) whether the uptake
of contraceptives is higher if option B is chosen. For these analyses, we
use data collected by the nurse at the health center and data reported
by the participants when they received the payments.
5.1. The FP meeting
In this section, we look at the treatment effects on (i) the atten-
dance of the FP meeting, conditional on option B being chosen for
payment and on (ii) contraceptive use conditional on attending the
FP meeting. This analysis tells us whether the husband's involvement
matters for the fulfillment of the condition of option B and whether the
husband's involvement or presence at the FP meeting affects the uptake
of contraceptives.

Note: The table reports the means for attending a family planning (FP) meeting if option B was chosen for payment, receiving modern contraceptives at the FP meeting and
receiving long-term contraceptives at the FP meeting in each treatment (columns (1)—(3)) and reports the p-value for two-sided t-tests of whether the means are different across
treatments (columns (4)—(6)). The two first rows include all couples for which option B was chosen for payment, while uptake of contraceptives only includes couples who attended
a FP meeting. "LARC" is an abbreviation for "long-acting reversible contraceptives"
Overall, 82% of the couples comply with the conditions. Slightly
more couples comply with the "Wife FPS" condition than with the
"Couple FPS" condition (86% vs 79%, two-sided t-test p =
0.082).
The first two rows of
Table 8
compare these proportions by treatment.
In these two rows, the sample sizes are the number of couples in
each treatment where option B was chosen for payment. Involving
the husband in the lab increases the likelihood that a FP meeting is
attended (especially in JD) for both "Wife FPS" and "Couple FPS". This
result is in line with the wife's expectations about the attendance of the
FP meeting (see Section 4.3): it is more likely that the FP meeting is
attended if the decision in the lab is made jointly than if the decision
is made by the wife alone.
Next, we investigate what happens once the wife or the couple are at
the FP meeting. 70% of the wives that attended a FP meeting received
modern contraceptives. The presence of the husband at the FP meeting
does not affect the uptake of contraceptives (no difference between
"Couple FPS" and "Wife FPS", two-sided t-test p = 0.690). As can be
seen from the third and fourth rows of
Table 8,
the use of contraceptives
does also not vary across the between-subject treatments. The husband
does not seem to have an influence on the use of contraceptives, once
they attend the FP meeting.
Different types of contraceptives can be received at the FP meeting.
To ensure continuity, the use of a LARC (implants or IUDS) is important.
17% of the women attending a FP meeting received a LARC. As can be
seen from the two last rows in
Table 8,
the uptake of LARC does not
depend on whether the husband is involved in the decision in the lab,
but it does depend on whether the husband attended the FP meeting
(12.8% with "Wife FPS" and 20.4% with "Couple FPS", two-sample,
two-sided t-test p = 0.083).
In sum, once option B is chosen for payment, most couples attend a
FP meeting. Once at the meeting, most couples receive contraceptives,
and a non-negligible fraction of them receive LARC. These findings can
also be interpreted as evidence against a potential social desirability
bias that might confound the treatment effects. It is plausible that the
participants wanted to appear more in favor of using FPS than they
actually are in order to "please" our research team, if they assumed
that we care about contraceptive use (remember that their decisions
were recorded by one of the enumerators). Such bias might increase the
overall proportion of decisions where FPS are chosen, and confound the
treatment differences if this bias is stronger among the husbands than
among the wives in our sample.
The husbands who choose FPS only to please us would then try to
make sure that their choice does not translate into reduced fertility.
They could do so by (i) not attending a FP meeting, (ii) not accepting
any contraceptives at the meeting, or (iii) only accepting short-term
contraceptives at the meeting. As we have seen, the involvement of the
husband does not reduce the likelihood of a FP meeting being attended
or the uptake of contraceptives. We take this as evidence against a
22
social desirability bias that might affect our results.
22 For women, it is difficult to disentangle social desirability bias from the
effect of low mobility and control over resources. However, we can compare
5.2. The effect of the choice of FPS on contraceptive use
We observed that a large proportion of the couples for which option
B was chosen for payment attended a FP meeting, and once at the
FP meeting a large proportion chose contraceptives. It is interesting
to test whether having to attend a FP meeting to receive the payment
translates into an increase in contraceptive use. Note that the couples
for which option A was chosen could still have taken up contraceptives
outside the experiment. To test this, we need to deal with potential
endogeneity that might bias the estimate of the effect of FPS services.
To do so, we exploit the random assignment to treatments and the
finding that the involvement of the husband increased the uptake of
FPS. This allows us to use the treatment assignment as an instrumental
variable for the choice of FPS.
To test whether the uptake of contraceptives is influenced by the
selection of FPS, we regress contraceptive use — as reported on the
payment date — on the selection of FPS.23
Table 9
displays the results. In columns (1)-(3) the selection of
FPS is treated as exogenous. To deal with potential endogeneity, in
columns (4)-(6) we instrument the selection of FPS by the experimental
treatments. As shown by the first stage, the choice of FPS is higher when
the husband is involved (i.e. in both JD and HD) with the exception of
"JD" when the condition is "Wife FPS" (see column
Table 9
shows that the choice of FPS increases contraceptive use
significantly. When treating FPS as exogenous, the likelihood that
contraceptives are chosen increases by around 60 percentage points if
option B is chosen for payment. The size of this effect is around 20 per-
centage points smaller when taking into account potential endogeneity
bias.
the reports of women and nurses on the uptake of contraceptives at the FP
meeting. If women report a higher uptake of contraceptives than nurses, this
can be an indication of a social desirability bias. Among the couples who
attended the family planning meeting, 79% of the women reported that they
received contraceptives, which is very close to the 78% as reported by the
nurses (Spearman's p = 0.94, p < 0.001).
23 A few participants were not interviewed when we visited them to give
their payment. This was the case where the option chosen gave a zero payment
to both the wife and the husband (2.9% of the couples). Despite this, one
of these women still attended the payment session, even though no payment
was given. The rest are excluded from the analysis. In addition, 14% of the
remaining couples did not show up to receive payment. Of these, 10 women
had attended the FP meeting and we therefore use the report from the nurse.
The remaining couples are excluded from the analysis, implying that about
10% are excluded from this analysis.
24 Note that the use of the plausible deniability mechanism might have
decoupled for some participants the link between the treatments and the final
selection of the payment, which might have weakened the treatment effects
in the first stage.

6. Discussion and conclusion
In this paper, we report the results of an experiment in which
couples can choose a payment conditional on receiving FPS at a local
health facility. We find that involving the husband increases the likeli-
hood that couples choose FPS. Most couples that need to attend FPS to
receive a payment, visit the health center; and once there, most of them
choose to continue or start to use contraceptives. In sum, our study
demonstrates that the husband has a very strong influence in the first
stage of the decision-making process, which is essential for the uptake
of FPS and modern contraceptives.
Using a household model that assumes complete information about
spousal preferences and complete certainty about the fulfillment of the
conditionality, our finding that the husband's involvement increases
the likelihood that FPS are chosen, can only be explained if men have
stronger preferences for FPS than women. We do not find evidence for
this assumption. In a next step, we extend our theoretical model and
test two alternative mechanisms that could explain the positive effect of
the husband's involvement. First, we show theoretically that inaccurate
beliefs about spousal preferences can explain the observed treatment
effects. We find strong evidence in support of this mechanism: the
positive effect of involving the husband is driven by couples where
the wife believes that the husband does not approve of contraceptives.
Second, we consider the role of the wife's expectations concerning the
likelihood that a FP meeting is attended. We find some support for this
mechanism: the expectation that the "Couple FPS" payment condition
is fulfilled is larger when the husband is involved in the decisions in
the lab.
Our results are in line with several qualitative and observational
studies that describe how the non-involvement of husbands and the
lack of communication between spouses can create substantial bar-
riers for the uptake of contraceptives (see, e.g.,
Lasee and Becker
(1997), Sharan and Valente (2002), Shattuck et al. (2011), Hartmann
et al. (2012), Mosha et al. (2013) and
Amo-Adjei et al. (2017)). Lasee
and Becker (1997
) show, using DHS data from Kenya, that the wife's
beliefs about whether the husband approves of family planning and
communication between spouses are highly correlated with contracep-
tive use, and that the wife's beliefs about the husband's preferences
Journal of Development Economics 158 (2022) 102915
are more likely to be correct if the couple discusses family planning.
Our analysis confirms that initiating communication among spouses is
a sufficient condition to increase the likelihood that FPS are chosen
(JD forces the couples to communicate). In sum, our study has not
only provided experimental evidence that supports the policy advice
from these studies to stimulate communication among spouses. It has
also generated new insights into why and when it could increase the
uptake of contraceptives. In particular, we demonstrated that the effect
of a lack of communication or the non-involvement of the husband
risks creating inaccurate beliefs about spousal preferences, which could
make women reluctant to use FPS. It is also clear from our analysis that
a policy that stimulates communication among spouses would only be
effective where spouses do not have substantially different preferences
about FPS.
Our study also complements the insights generated by other ex-
perimental studies on the husband's involvement. Ashraf et al. (2014)
demonstrated that bypassing the husband could increase women's up-
take of contraceptives where men want more children and have higher
bargaining power than women. However, this might lower women's
subjective well-being, due to increased spousal dissatisfaction. In a
more recent study,
Ashraf et al. (2020) showed that increasing the
husband's knowledge about maternal health costs reduces pregnancy
rates without affecting spousal satisfaction. Treating husbands not only
lowers their desired fertility; it also leads to more frequent communica-
tion about family planning, and higher marital satisfaction. They also
find that husbands have more accurate beliefs about their wife's fertility
preferences.
McCarthy (2019) found that the husband's involvement
reduces pregnancy rates, but not where there is recent IPV. We do
not investigate the effect of the husband's involvement on knowledge
or spousal satisfaction. Further, in contrast with McCarthy (2019), we
do not find that the husband's involvement interacts with IPV. Our
results demonstrate that the husband's involvement has the potential
to increase the uptake of contraceptives, by correcting women's beliefs
about their husband's fertility preferences.
More broadly, our findings indicate that where information about
spousal preferences is incomplete, existing household models should
incorporate individual beliefs about spousal preferences as an addi-
tional parameter. This increases the complexity of household models,
and broadens the set of potential effects of the involvement of the
husband. It also opens the door to potential efficiency losses when
decisions are made individually. In our setting, characterized by large
gender inequality and inaccurate beliefs about spousal preferences, this
translates in a positive effect of the husband's involvement on the
uptake of the opportunities offered. Our results suggest that reaching
out to women might be less effective if the husband is not involved.
In particular, there is a considerable risk that opportunities offered to
women remain then underutilized.
The results presented in this paper point to several avenues for fu-
ture research. First, we need more theoretical and empirical research on
the role of incomplete information in household bargaining to achieve
a better understanding of household decision-making. Why is there
incomplete information in the household and how can this be modeled
theoretically? In what domains do we observe incomplete informa-
tion between spouses? Second, further research on intra-household
communication about fertility preferences is necessary to increase our
understanding of intra-household decision-making and its effect on
contraceptive use. For example, more evidence is needed on the con-
ditions under which such communication takes place and could be
facilitated. Finally, it is likely that communication influences efficiency
in household decision-making in other domains as well where spouses
potentially (think they) disagree. While we focused on contraceptives
on which we know there tends to be little discussion among spouses in
patriarchal societies in low-income countries, similar questions can be
asked about other domains where there is little communication among

Abstract
Background:
Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) and performance-based incentives (PBls) can improve
health-worker performance. However, there is minimal evidence on the combined effects of these interventions or
perceived effects among maternal and child healthcare providers in low-resource settings. We thus aimed to explore
the perceptions of maternal and child healthcare providers of CDSS support in the context of a combined CDSS-PBI
intervention on performance in twelve primary care facilities in Ghana's Upper East Region.
Methods: We conducted a qualitative study drawing on semi-structured key informant interviews with 24 nurses
and midwives, 12 health facility managers, and 6 district-level staff familiar with the intervention. We analysed data
thematically using deductive and inductive coding in NVivo 10 software.
Results: Interviewees suggested the combined CDSS-PBI intervention improved their performance, through enhanc-
ing knowledge of maternal health issues, facilitating diagnoses and prescribing, prompting actions for complications,
and improving management. Some interviewees reported improved morbidity and mortality. However, challenges
described in patient care included CDSS software inflexibility (e.g. requiring administration of only one intermittent
preventive malaria treatment to pregnant women), faulty electronic partograph leading to unnecessary referrals,
increased workload for nurses and midwives who still had to complete facility forms, and power fluctuations affecting
software.

Conclusion:
Combining CDSS and PBI interventions has potential to improve maternal and child healthcare provi-
Sion in low-income settings. However, user perspectives and context must be considered, along with allowance for
revisions, when designing and implementing CDSS and PBls interventions.

Background
Frontline health-worker performance is a common chal-
lenge in resource-constrained settings [1]. Health-worker
behaviours are complex with many potential influences,
though research indicates general enablers of improved
performance include in-service training in use of tools,
constructive feedback, and receiving positive recognition
[2]. In low and middle-income country (LMIC) health
systems, performance is additionally constrained by staff-
ing deficiencies and ad hoc task shifting thus weakening
capacity to achieve national and global health goals [3].
Access to health infrastructure is indispensable but not
enough [4] and poor quality-of-care impedes achieving
Sustainable Development Goal 3 'ensure healthy lives
and promote well-being for all at all ages' [5]. Therefore,
health systems must ensure good quality care.
A key example of this issue is maternal and neonatal
health (MNH), which cannot improve in LMICs without
ensuring the availability of adequate numbers of compe-
tent and motivated providers at health facilities. Despite
improvements in access to and use of MNH care in many
LMICs, mortality rates remain high and gaps between
low-income and high-income countries continue [6]. The
high levels of mortality are attributed to poor quality of
care in the health facilities [6—9], characterized by over-
crowding and understaffing, with inappropriate manage-
ment of complicated deliveries and untimely response to
emergencies [10].
Initial efforts focused on improving MNH provider
performance through in-service trainings, assuming
problems are due to inadequate knowledge and skills
[11]. Millions of training dollars later, healthcare indica-
tors are little improved and MNH providers still require
support [11]. Recognising training is not the only solu-
tion, more recent interventions involve infrastructure
improvements and advocacy for skilled birth attendance
[12, 13]. Packages of interventions appear more effec-
tive than single interventions [1, 8]. For example, assess-
ment of Standards-Based Management and Recognition
(SBM-RO) for quality improvement, in three Ethiopian
hospitals and eight health centres, showed significant
improvement in MNH provider performance during
labour, delivery, and immediate postnatal services [14].
Evidence suggests computerised decision-support sys-
tems (CDSS) and performance-based incentives (PBIs)
could enhance health-worker motivation and perfor-
mance [15—17]. CDSS are electronic tools that prompt
provider behaviours with patient-specific prompts,
treatment guidelines, automatic medication dosing cal-
culations, and reports of overdue tests and medications
[18].
PBIs involve compensating health-workers for work
beyond their typical remit so they feel appreciated and
that effort is valued. Offering monetary or other recog-
nition for high-performing employees aims to counter-
act weak or indirect health system incentives [19, 20]
by directly linking rewards to actions that achieve per-
formance targets and therefore contribute to improved
health outcomes [16, 21, 22]. P Bls can also enhance effec-
tiveness by stimulating innovation, enhancing teamwork,
incentivizing service in remote locations, and improving
retention [15, 23—25].
Literature focuses on individual effect of P Bls on
health-worker motivation but not on the combined
effects of CDSS and P Bls on performance [15, 26]. Our
previous study in Ghana's Upper East Region was one of
the first to analyse the combined effects of these inter-
ventions on client satisfaction with maternal and neo-
natal healthcare [16]. Implementation of CDSS in the
context of an ongoing PBI intervention in Upper East
Region provided an opportunity to examine perceived
effects of both interventions among health-workers, as
we found no other qualitative studies on this topic and
research had shown sub-optimal motivation and perfor-
mance among maternal and neonatal healthcare provid-
ers in these areas and potential scope for improvement
[25, 27]. This qualitative study thus aimed to explore
health-worker perspectives of the effects of CDSS, in the
context of a combined CDSS-PBI intervention, on mater-
nal and child healthcare provision in primary facilities in
Ghana's Upper East Region.
Methods
Study design and sites
This qualitative study reanalyses 66 semi-structured
interviews conducted with frontline health-workers,
facility managers, and district supervisors at the end of
the European Union-funded Quality of maternal and
neonatal health (QUALMAT) intervention trial [15, 26,
28]. This cluster-randomized un-blinded controlled trial,
conducted in Ghana's Upper East region, aimed to assess


Aninanya et al. BMC Health Services Research
the effect of a CDSS for maternal and neonatal health
care services.
The trial was conducted in twelve health facilities in
Kassena-Nankana (KND) and Builsa districts and is
described in Aninanya et al. [16]. KND (intervention dis-
trict) has an estimated population of 152,000 served by
one hospital in the district capital Navrongo, six health
centres, one private clinic, and twenty-seven Commu-
nity-based Health Planning and Services (CHPS) com-
pounds. Builsa (comparison district) has an estimated
population of 95,800 served by the district hospital in
Sandema, six health centres, and thirteen CHPS com-
pounds. MNH services were considered poor in Upper
East Region, due to insufficient and demotivated staff;
inadequate access to and use of computers, reproductive
health guidance, and protocols; and inadequate diagno-
ses and referrals [29—31]. A cross-sectional study of 400
new mothers indicated 93% had delivered in health facili-
ties and 97% had received antenatal care with 75% having
four or more antenatal visits [32]. However, institutional
MMR in the Upper East Region prior to the trial was 352
per 100,000 live births and estimated at 367 and 259 per
100,000 live births In KND and Builsa district respec-
tively [33]. Nurses and midwives are responsible for pro-
vision of facility-based MNH services in these districts
[34], with low productivity reported as some provid-
ers rarely used treatment guidelines or partograph, and
missed health education opportunities [8].
CDSS and PBI interventions were implemented in six
KND intervention facilities for two years (2012—2014).
CDSS included computerized clinical support in imple-
menting WHO 'Pregnancy, Childbirth, Postpartum and
Newborn Care: a guide for essential practice' guidelines
for 35 purposively selected and trained midwives, com-
munity health nurses, and facility managers. Each inter-
vention facility received a laptop, with CDSS software
and IT support, shared between three trained midwives
and nurses, while facility managers were tasked with
supervision.
Performance was rewarded based on improvements
within facilities rather than in comparison to other
facilities. Individuals were identified for P Bls based on
achieving key indicators determined by facility leader-
ship, regional and district health directorates, and the
PBI committee. PBI consisted of rewarding best-per-
forming midwives and facilities with domestic appliances
(e.g. blenders, fans, stoves, freezers, fridges, televisions,
saucepans, cloths, kettles, microwaves) and recogni-
tion certificates at annual awards ceremonies, along with
regular supervision, verbal appreciation, furniture, and
small monthly allowances [15, 16]. Key performance
indicators included proportion of ANC visits recorded in
CDSS; proportions of pregnant women receiving tetanus
Page 3 of 9
vaccination, iron supplementation, safe sex and HIV
counselling; proportion of births attended by skilled per-
sonnel; proportion of partographs completed in CDSS;
partograph usage rate; proportion of women referred
based on CDSS recommendation; and proportion of
newborns vaccinated [16].
Sampling and recruitment
We included all 24 participating CDSS users, 6 facil-
ity managers, and 6 district-level staff in intervention
facilities and used purposive non-probability sampling
to select equal numbers of equivalent participants in
comparison facilities. This enabled us to include non-
intervention participants with similar workloads who
could provide relevant insights. GAA obtained written
informed consent from all participants before interview.
Data collection
We developed an interview guide from the literature and
expert opinion. Topics included basic demographics,
experiences of CDSS and PBI interventions if relevant,
work challenges, and suggested solutions. GAA and two
research assistants conducted in-person audio-recorded
interviews in English, lasting 35—45 min, in locations
such as homes and health facilities as chosen by partici-
pants. We used interviews with facility managers and
district-level staff, because of their varied involvement
supervising the intervention, to triangulate and crystalize
findings from frontline providers. To ensure confidential-
ity, we assigned identification codes and did not include
personal identifiers in study tools or outputs. Audio
files were transcribed verbatim by two professional
transcriptionists.
Analysis
GAA imported transcripts into Nvivo 10 (QSR Interna-
tional Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia) data management soft-
ware [35] and analysed them thematically using Braun
and Clarke's six-stage approach [36]. In summary, GAA
read and became familiarised with the data, identified
deductive codes based on interview guide topics and
inductively coded new or unexpected topics arising in
transcripts. She developed a coding structure iteratively,
collating codes related to intervention effects, challenges,
and suggestions into themes. GAA examined relation-
ships between codes, compiled and summarised con-
tents of each theme with support from co-authors, and
conducted thematic mapping. GAA and NH refined and
defined themes and sub-themes through discussion, fur-
ther integration, and the reporting process. Triangulation
of participant perspectives (i.e. midwives, nurses, medi-
cal assistants, district public health nurses, directors)


Aninanya et al. BMC Health Services Research
at different health system levels and in both study arms
helped improve validity.
Results
Participant characteristics and analytical themes
In all 66 participants were included in the study, 32 in
intervention and 34 in comparison facilities. Most (64)
were women, 48 were maternal healthcare providers (i.e.

"It has helped me to know more. Especially, if you
are educating an ANC woman, you can just educate
the woman without cracking your brains. Ihe infor-
mation we get from the CDSS to educate the women
has helped improve the quality of care." (Midwife, 33
years, intervention arm)

ity managers (i.e. 6 each intervention and comparison),
and 6 were district-level staff (i.e. 2 intervention and 4
comparison).
We organised findings under three deductive themes
of perceived CDSS-PBI effects on provider performance,
challenges to CDSS use, and suggestions for improv-
ing provider performance. We reported perceptions of
frontline and managerial participants in intervention and
control facilities separately and included inductive sub-
themes as appropriate.
CDSS-PBI effects on provider performance
All 36 intervention participants indicated CDSS-PBI
interventions had enhanced performance. Reportedly,
MNH care providers' knowledge of maternal health
issues increased and quality-of-care improved. CDSS
helped guide diagnoses and prescribing, prompting
health-workers on necessary actions in managing routine
care and pregnancy-related complications. Three induc-
tive sub-themes were: (i) reminders and health education
support, (ii) improved performance, and (iii) improved
clinical processes and outcomes.
Reminders and health education support
Midwives and nurses generally appreciated the automatic
reminders, such as to provide deworming drugs.
"It alerts us on what to do and because of that, we
can do things. For the Albendazole [deworming],
that one if you have not given to the woman and you
are entering it will ask you whether you have given
the drug It has affected IPT [intermittent pre-
ventive treatment for malaria] because the way the
book is, sometimes you can forget that the person
has not taken IPT, but the computer will alert you..."
(Midwife, 34 years, intervention arm)
"I will say the quality of maternal care has
improved. We are now prompted to administer cer-
tain drugs like Albendazole..." (Midwife, 60 years,
intervention arm)
Similarly, many frontline providers noted how useful it
was having key messages and educational information at
their fingertips.
"[I]t will be alerting you on what to do. So, I will say
it guides us on what to do and how to do but before,
you have to make your own decision." (Midwife, 33
years, intervention arm)
Improved performance
Several frontline health-workers described being
more efficient or better performing their duties. Some
described this in relation to CDSS.
"It [CDSS] has affected antenatal coverage because
you are able to attend to more clients in a day.
Sometimes we attend to about 50 women in a day..."
(Midwife, 34 years, intervention arm)
"Performance has improved in the sense that if you
open the 2012 and the 2013 registers, you will see
a vast difference. Now we check all the HB [haemo-
globin] of the clients and we also counsel them a lot.
Also, if the woman comes and she is 28 weeks, the
computer will tell you what to do since it is pre-term
labou/.' (Medical Assistant, 54 years, intervention
arm)
Many described improvements in relation to P Bls and
increased motivation.
"I work hard since I know it will pay off by not only
improving quality of care but something small from
the project..." (Midwife, intervention facility)
Some midwives also related P Bls to improving their job
satisfaction as well as performance.
"I like the performance-based package because when
I perform well, I am awarded. I get inner satisfac-
tion. Ihat helps me to give my best." (Midwife, inter-
ventionfacility)
Managers with access to aggregated data described
similar perspectives.
"Ihe interventions [CDSS-PBI] have contributed
to improved performance because the midwife is
more committed to work. She barely even leaves the
maternity and I think it has even increased some of


Aninanya et al. BMC Health Services Research
the indicators and deliveries over the past few years.
Our facility has contributed significantly to the dis-
trict performance, which has been recognized by the
district. lhere has been an improvement in anti-tet-
anus vaccinations to pregnant women and intermit-
tent preventive treatment. I realized that previously
there were issues oflPT3, child welfare and Penta 3
but I think over the past 2 years there has been an
improvement." (Medical Assistant, 37 years, male,
intervention arm)
Several managers also noted benefits of PBIs, particu-
larly in terms of midwives' motivation to work more
actively.
"Performance-based incentives have made them
happy. It shows that they are working. You know
they had certificates, they had parcels This has
made them very happy, and they are doing the work.
It has made them to do the work more and more."
(Facility manager, intervention facility)
Improved clinical processes and outcomes
Most described improved work processes, with some
describing this as improving quality-of-care while others
referred to improving MNH outcomes, including mortal-
ity. For example, a district manager referred to CDSS as
their new doctor:
"Ihe computer also has all the protocols so, because
this district we don't have a doctor, the computer is
now our doctor. Ihe computer guides us. The nurse
doesn't panic because the computer tells them what
to do." (District Public Health Nurse, 54 years, inter-
vention arm)
Frontline providers similarly described how protocols
and reminders improved clinical processes for them.
"With the CDSS, if a client's BP [blood pressure] is
high, it will ask you to recheck and if it is still high,
it will ask you to do something for the client, either
you refer or detain. With the paper-based protocols,
most often you just skip these vital things. CDSS also
makes it easy to access previous patient's history."
(Midwife, 27 years, Intervention arm).
"For PNC [postnatal care], after delivery you have to
check the woman frequently; 15 min, 30 min, 1 h for
6 h and at the end you can know the woman is now
well." (Midwife, 34 years, intervention arm)
Many health-workers connected process improve-
ments with improved maternal outcomes, either through
Page 5 of 9
women receiving all required services and treatments or
through encouraging earlier referrals.
"It has reduced maternal deaths because if a woman
comes and you monitor to a certain level, the CDSS
will just tell you to refer and so it makes us to refer
early." (Midwife, 44 years, intervention arm)
Municipal and district managers had similar perspec-
tives on the advantages of CDSS. As one noted:
.. with the paper-based protocols, they are mostly in
their cabinets and not on their tables and that make
them feel lazy using them, but this one makes you
alert as you are entering the data while reviewing
the protocol. Without the protocol, some even refer
cases that they are not supposed to refer... Ihe CDSS
has improved the midwives' knowledge and helps
them refer clients early. Quality of maternal health-
care has improved because you don't do things in the
abstract." (Municipal Public Health Nurse, 58 years,
intervention arm)
Several managers also described specific benefits of
PBIs. As another noted:
"Health workers were behaving negatively towards
work but the [PBI] intervention has come to improve
on it. For the first time it was introduced they were
not serious because they didn't know there will be
awards but when the first award ceremony came,
they became serious and when they go to work, they
are actually busy...' (District Public Health Nurse, 59
years, intervention arm)
Challenges to CDSS use
Alongside perceived improvements, intervention par-
ticipants described challenges in using CDSS. Some
appeared relatively easily addressable, such as software
requiring administration of only one malaria IPT to preg-
nant women and increased workloads as nurses and mid-
wives still had to complete facility forms in addition to
CDSS data screens. Others were more challenging, such
as faulty electronic partograph leading to unnecessary
referrals and power fluctuations affecting software use.
The IPT gap was a common complaint.
"7here are certain things in the CDSS that should be
improved. Ihe IPT should be first, second, and third.
It's only once in the CDSS" (Midwife, 54 years, inter-
vention arm).
Most frontline health-workers found it annoying and
time-consuming to complete both CDSS data screens
and paper documentation.


Aninanya et al. BMC Health Services Research
"It has also increased our workload because we have
to use the computer, and attend to the woman, and
at the same time enter it into the book" (Midwife, 29
years, intervention facility).
Some midwives suggested that maternity clients also
found this annoying.
"Ihe only complaint they (clients) give is that they
keep long because you enter their personal infor-
mation into the maternal book and afterwards you
enter the same information into the CDSS" (Mid-
wife, 33 years, intervention arm).
Some also suggested that added form filling distracted
from patient care.
"In fact, to use the computer to monitor a patient is
sometimes difficult, it doesn't need one person. Ifa
woman is in labour, you can't come to the computer
again" (Midwife, 56 years, intervention arm).
Many health-workers noted that the CDSS partograph
required too many referrals.
"If you want to follow the partographs strictly on the
CDSS, you will end up referring all your delivery cli-
ents" (Midwives, 29 years, intervention arm).
All noted that CDSS equipment's short battery life and
reliance on electricity could be problematic.
"Sometimes too, if there is light out and the battery
is down you can't use it for patient care" (Midwife,
40 years, intervention arm).
Suggestions for improving provider performance
Other than addressing the issues highlighted above, sug-
gestions for improving performance came from com-
parison arm participants. Interestingly, all comparison
participants reported some performance improvements
(the study was not blinded) but noted considerable need
for further improvement. However, when asked whether
they knew anything about CDSS or PBIs or how these
worked most said no and were thus not questioned fur-
ther about the intervention. Instead, the issues they dis-
cussed were primarily about the challenges they faced in
their work and how these could be addressed. Despite
their lack of reported knowledge, all comparison health-
workers requested PBIs, along with more promotion
opportunities and staff to spread the workload, and
described the need for protocols, phone-based guide-
lines, and equipment (e.g. test kits, blood pressure appa-
ratus, haemoglobin machines) to enhance their work.
"lhere is a slight improvement in performance but
there is still more room for improvement. Protocols
Page 6 of 9
and incentives that are supposed to enhance our
performance are inadequate." (Midwife, 48 years,
comparison arm)
Comparison area managers reiterated frontline per-
spectives, with poor partograph use in comparison facili-
ties highlighted.
"Performance is moderate because we don't have
the requisite protocols in the facility to make clini-
cal decisions. Partograph utilization is poor in most
cases." (Community health offcer, 27 years, compar-
ison arm)
"Generally, the performance of nurses is encour-
aging. Although some indicators have declined, it
is still not bad. Partograph utilization is poor but
labour and delivery services, tetanus care coverage,
and pregnancy at risk referred seem to be looking
good based on the statistics." (District Health Infor-
mation Offcer, 41 years, comparison arm)
All comparison health-workers advocated for access to
CDSS.
"Authorities should introduce electronic decision
support systems to enhance patient-based care"
(Midwife, 57 years, comparison arm).
Comparison managers expressed the same wish to have
the CDSS-PBI intervention in their facilities.
"All facilities should have computers where the pro-
viders can also learn new protocols in maternal and
neonatal health services through the internet. Ihey
should be trained on how to use these computers
to monitor labour and they should be given finan-
Cial package." (District health information offcer, 37
years, comparison arm)
"I will suggest improved logistics and human
resources, provision of financial package to both
clients and workers to boost their morale." (District
Director, 59 years, comparison arm)
Discussion
This qualitative study examined frontline and mana-
gerial perspectives of CDSS combined with a PBI
intervention, indicating perceived improvements in
health-worker performance and conditions as com-
pared to comparison arm counterparts. CDSS appeared
to enhance provider knowledge of maternal health
issues and health education messaging, support care
provision through reminders and protocols, and
increase referrals. This was despite baseline research


Aninanya et al. BMC Health Services Research
suggesting very limited technological knowledge
among these providers [28, 37]. Several intensive train-
ings and supportive supervision equipped health-work-
ers with the necessary technical skills to use computers
for maternal care, as also shown in Canada [38]. This
reinforces research findings on the benefits of CDSS for
MNH provider performance [28, 39] and implies that
contributions to achieving SDG 3 and universal health
coverage (UHC) [40] could invest in such interventions
to enhance health-worker performance [12, 34, 41, 42].
Comparison area participants, on the contrary,
reported commensurately smaller improvements with
suggestions for additional changes that likely related
to other simultaneous MNH initiatives in Upper
East region [16, 43, 44]. Interestingly, suggestions for
improvement were all from comparison facilities and
despite indicating their lack of awareness of CDSS and
P Bls they expressed considerable interest. This sug-
gests that the concepts of CDSS and P Bls were quite
popular with or without explicit knowledge of either
intervention. It is thus worth noting that comparison
participants recommended CDSS-PBI intervention
components [40] be introduced in their facilities to
further improve performance (e.g. protocols on their
mobile phones, incentives), along with essential sup-
plies and equipment such as test kits, blood pressure
apparatus. This supports evidence from other settings
on the perceived benefits of CDSS and P Bls to improve
performance [2, 25, 37].
While it was not possible to confirm the maternal mor-
tality improvements reported by participants, recent evi-
dence showed this intervention improved antenatal and
delivery clients' satisfaction with care [16]. Increased
satisfaction suggests services, attitudes, or both had
improved [45]. Additionally, use of relevant clinical
guidelines was reportedly high among intervention
health-workers, while earlier research in the area showed
this as poor [27, 31]. Thus, improved access to and
required use of clinical protocols and guidelines as part
of CDSS in intervention facilities likely meant improved
quality-of-care and reduced clinical errors, as indicated
in other research on use of computerized guidelines to
reduce errors [46] and epidemiological research in Ghana
and other LMICs [46, 47].
What this study does show is that, despite some oper-
ational challenges (e.g. software glitches, electricity),
health-workers' reported job satisfaction and quality-of-
care improved with the introduction of the CDSS-PBI
intervention. This is promising, though further research
is needed on intervention cost-effectiveness and sus-
tainability before any policy decision should be taken on
wider implementation.

Strengths and limitations
The study fills a gap in knowledge as there are no stud-
ies on the combined effects of these interventions on
health-workers care providers' performance. How-
ever, several limitations should be considered when
interpreting the findings. First, while the focus was on
CDSS, both CDSS and PBI were running concurrently,
it was not feasible to assess the two intervention com-
ponents separately. Second, the qualitative results pre-
sent just the perceptions of health professionals with
regards to the intervention, a mixed-method approach
would have created an opportunity to collect both
qualitative and quantitative data at the same time and
would have offset weaknesses associated with using one
method [48].
Conclusion
Findings indicated predominantly positive perceptions of
the CDSS-PBI intervention helped improve MNH care
provider performance in the Upper East Region. CDSS
and P Bls have potential to improve frontline health-
workers' motivation and adherence to clinical guidelines.
However, while this combined intervention shows prom-
ise for longer-term or wider implementation, context
and perspectives must be considered when developing,
implementing, and assessing any performance improve-
ment intervention. Thus, further research is still required
to assess the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of per-
formance improvements.

Abstract
Objective
To determine the clinical manifestations, risk factors,
and maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant and
recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed
coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).
DESIGN
Living systematic review and meta-analysis.
DATA SOURCES
Medline, Embase, Cochrane database, WHO COVID-19
database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure
(CNKI), and Wanfang databases from 1 December
2019 to 27 April 2021, along with preprint servers,
social media, and reference lists.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Pregnant women are considered to be a high risk group for severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, and the potential
adverse effects of the virus on maternal and perinatal outcomes are of concern
In non-pregnant populations admitted to hospital with coronavirus disease
2019 (covid-19) the most common symptoms are fever, cough, and dyspnoea,
reported in more than two thirds of individuals
Advancing age, high body mass index, non-white ethnicity, and pre-existing
comorbidities are risk factors for severe covid-19 in the general population
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
Pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 diagnosed in hospital are
less likely to manifest symptoms of fever, cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia than
non-pregnant women of reproductive age
Pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19 are at increased risk of
admission to an intensive care unit, receiving invasive ventilation, or death
compared with non-pregnant women of reproductive age with covid-19
Risk factors for severe disease in pregnancy include increasing maternal age,
high body mass index, non-white ethnicity, pre-existing comorbidities, and
pregnancy specific disorders such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia
Pregnant women with covid-19 are more likely to experience preterm birth and
their neonates are more likely to be stillborn or admitted to a neonatal unit
Pregnant women with covid-19 had an absolute risk increase for admission to
intensive care unit, preterm birth, caesarean section, and admission of their
neonates to neonatal unit compared with pregnant women without covid-19
thebmj I doi: 10.1136/bmj.m3320
STUDY SELECTION
Cohort studies reporting the rates, clinical
manifestations (symptoms, laboratory and
radiological findings), risk factors, and maternal and
perinatal outcomes in pregnant and recently pregnant
women with suspected or confirmed covid-19.
DATA EXTRACTION
At least two researchers independently extracted the
data and assessed study quality. Random effects
meta-analysis was performed, with estimates pooled
as odds ratios or risk difference and proportions with
95% confidence intervals. All analyses are updated
regularly.
RESULTS
435 studies were included. Overall, 9% (95%
confidence interval 7% to 10%; 149 studies, 926
232 women) of pregnant and recently pregnant
women attending or admitted to hospital for any
reason were diagnosed as having suspected or
confirmed covid-19. The most common clinical
manifestations of covid-19 in pregnancy were fever
and cough (both 36%). Compared with non-pregnant
women of reproductive age, pregnant and recently
pregnant women with covid-19 were less likely to
report symptoms of fever, dyspnoea, cough, and
myalgia. The odds of admission to an intensive
care unit (odds ratio 2.61, 95% confidence interval
1.84 to 3.71; 12=85.60/0), and invasive ventilation
(2.41, 2.13 to 2.71; 12=00/0) were higher in pregnant
and recently pregnant than non-pregnant women
of reproductive age. Overall, 970 pregnant women
(0.2%, 123 studies, 179 981 women) with confirmed
covid-19 died from any cause. In pregnant women
with covid-19, non-white ethnicity, increased maternal
age, high body mass index, any pre-existing maternal
comorbidity including chronic hypertension and
diabetes, and pregnancy specific complications
such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia,
were associated with serious complications (severe
covid-19, admission to an intensive care unit,
invasive ventilation, and maternal death). Compared
to pregnant women without covid-19, those with the
disease had increased odds of maternal death (odds
ratio 6.09, 95% confidence interval 1.82 to 20.38;
12=76.60/0), of admission to the intensive care unit

D, and admission to the
neonatal intensive care unit (2.18, 1.46 to 3.26,
12=85.40/0) were higher in babies born to women with
covid-19 versus those without covid-19.
CONCLUSION
Pregnant and recently pregnant women with covid-19
attending or admitted to the hospitals for any reason
are less likely to manifest symptoms such as fever,
cough, dyspnoea, and myalgia, but are more likely
to be admitted to the intensive care unit or needing
invasive ventilation than non-pregnant women of
reproductive age. Pre-existing comorbidities, non-
white ethnicity, chronic hypertension, pre-existing
diabetes, high maternal age, and high body mass
index are risk factors for severe covid-19 outcomes
in pregnancy. Pregnant women with covid-19 versus
without covid-19 are more likely to deliver preterm
and have an increased risk of maternal death and
of being admitted to the intensive care unit. Their
babies are more likely to be admitted to the neonatal
intensive care unit.

Introduction
Since the first report (December 2019) of the novel
coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), the number of confirmed cases and
associated mortality and morbidity have increased
rapidly. 12 Pregnant women are considered a high
risk group because of concerns about the effect of
covid-19 on them during and after pregnancy, and
on their neonates.3 Quantification of the rates of
covid-19, its risk factors, clinical manifestations, and
outcomes is key to planning clinical maternal care and
4
management in an evolving pandemic scenario.
Publications on covid-19 in pregnancy have risen
steeply through individual case reports, case series,
observational studies, and systematic reviews. Since
the publication of our original living systematic
review on covid-19 in pregnancy, over 150 reviews
6-11
have been published in this area,
with many more
registered in PROSPERO.9 12
Early reviews mostly
included case reports and case series that were often
inappropriately meta-analysed providing biased
estimates.13 Subsequent reviews differed little from
2
each other, often including similar primary studies,
many with duplicate data. These reviews became
quickly outdated as new evidence emerged. Moreover,
the sampling frames in primary studies have varied,
ranging from universal SARS-CoV-2 testing for all
14 15
pregnant women admitted to hospital
to symptom
16 17
based testing.
Testing strategies have also differed
within and between countries, with diagnosis in
many early studies based on epidemiological risk
assessment and clinical features without confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which need to be considered in
the analysis.18 Limitations in the external and internal
validity of studies make it challenging for guideline
developers and policy makers to make evidence based
recommendations for the management of pregnant
and recently pregnant women with covid-19.
We started this living systematic review in April 2020
to determine the clinical manifestations of covid-19 in
pregnant and recently pregnant women, identify the
risk factors for complications, and quantify maternal
and perinatal outcomes. The systematic review is being
updated on a regular basis.
Methods
Our systematic review is based on a prospectively
registered protocol (PROSPERO CRD42020178076;
registered 22 April 2020)19 to evaluate a series of
research questions on covid-19 during and after
pregnancy. We report our findings on the rates,
clinical manifestations, risk factors, and maternal and
perinatal outcomes in women with covid-19 in line with
the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews
and meta-analyses (PRISMA) recommendations
(see appendix 1). As more relevant data become
available, we shall answer other research questions
in our published protocol.20 Each cycle of our living
systematic review involves weekly search updates
(rounds), with analysis performed every 4-6 months
for reporting through a dedicated website, with early
analysis if new definitive evidence emerges. We are
regularly reviewing the planned frequency of updates.
Literature search
Our weekly search update included a systematic
search of major databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane
database, WHO (World Health Organization) COVID- 19
database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure
(CNKI), and Wanfang databases for relevant studies
on covid-19 in pregnant and recently pregnant
women. We also coordinated our search efforts with
the Evidence for Policy and Practice Information and
Co-ordinating Centre (EPPI-Centre), WHO Library, and
Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility group. Additional
searches were conducted of preprint servers, blogs,
websites that serve as repositories for covid-19 studies
such as the LOVE platform (Living Overview of the
Evidence),21
social media, guidelines, and reference
lists of included studies. For this second update of
the review, we included studies from searches up to
27 April 2021. We contacted established groups that
were coordinating or conducting surveillance and

studies in pregnant women with covid-19, such as the
WHO Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent health
(MNCAH) covid- 19 research network, the International
Network of Obstetric Survey Systems (INOSS),
the United States Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease
Prevention and Control for information on published
and upcoming data. No language restrictions were
applied. Appendix 2 provides details of the search
strategies and databases searched.
Study selection
Two reviewers independently selected studies using
a two stage process: they first screened the titles
and abstracts of studies and then assessed the full
text of the selected studies in detail for eligibility. A
total of 28 reviewers contributed to study selection.
Disagreements were resolved through discussion
with a third reviewer (ST or JA). We excluded studies
if the duplicated data for all outcomes of interest were
published elsewhere, as reported by the study authors,
or when the characteristics of the women or neonates
matched the setting, characteristics, and duration of
another study from the same geographical location. If
there was an overlap of data or suspicion of duplicates
of participants in studies, we included studies based on
their study design (prioritising comparative cohorts),
and sample size (larger study prioritised).
We defined women as having confirmed covid-19
if they had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2
22
infection irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.
Women with a diagnosis based only on clinical or
radiological findings were defined as having suspected
covid-19. The recently pregnant group comprised
women in the postpartum and post-abortion period. We
included studies that compared covid-19 rates, clinical
manifestations (symptoms, laboratory and radiological
results), risk factors, and associated mortality and
morbidity between pregnant and recently pregnant
and non-pregnant women of reproductive age, and
those that compared maternal and perinatal outcomes
in pregnant women with and without covid-19. In
studies comparing maternal and perinatal outcomes
of pregnant women with covid-19 to those without, we
classified the comparative controls as being historical
if the cohort of pregnant women without covid-19
gave birth before December 2019. Studies on non-
comparative cohorts with a minimum of 10 participants
were included if they reported on the rates and clinical
manifestations of covid-19 and relevant outcomes in
pregnant and recently pregnant women. We defined
cohort studies as those that sampled participants on
the basis of exposure, followed-up participants over
time, and ascertained the outcomes.23 The PROSPERO
protocol provides a full list of the risk factors, clinical
features, and outcomes evaluated. 19
The sampling frames for detecting covid-19 included
universal screening and testing, when all women were
assessed for covid-19 using reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2,
chest computed tomography or antigen-detection

RESEARCH
lateral flow or rapid diagnostic tests (Ag-RDTs); risk
based testing on the basis of epidemiological history and
clinical manifestations by National Health Commission
of China (NHCC) guidelines18
and symptom based
testing when testing was only performed on women
with symptoms and those with a history of contact
with affected individuals. We defined the population
as being selected when only specific groups of women
were included, such as those undergoing caesarean
section or in the third trimester. We categorised studies
as a high risk group if only women with any pre-existing
medical or obstetric risk factors were included, low risk
if women did not have any risk factors, and any risk if
all women were included.
Study quality assessment and data extraction
The quality of the comparative cohort studies was
assessed for selection, comparability, and outcome
ascertainment bias using the Newcastle Ottawa
scale.24 Studies achieving four stars for selection, two
for comparability, and three for ascertainment of the
outcome were considered to have a low risk of bias.
Studies achieving two or three stars for selection, one
for comparability, and two for outcome ascertainment
were considered to have a medium risk of bias,
and any study achieving one star for selection or
outcome ascertainment, or zero for any of the three
domains, was regarded as having a high risk of bias.
We assessed the quality of studies reporting on the
prevalence of clinical manifestations or outcomes for
25
internal and external validity using an existing tool.
The following were considered as low risk of bias for
external validity: representative of national population
for relevant variables (population), representative of
target population (sampling frame), random selection
(selection bias), and more than 75% response rate
in individuals with and without the outcome (non-
response bias) .25 Two independent reviewers extracted
data using a pre-piloted form.
Statistical analysis
We pooled the comparative dichotomous data using
random effects meta-analysis and summarised the
findings as odds ratios and risk differences with
95% confidence intervals. To combine comparative
continuous data with dichotomous data, we
transformed standardised mean differences to
logarithm odds ratios, assuming a normal underlying
26
distribution. We pooled the dichotomous non-
comparative data for rates of clinical manifestations
and maternal and perinatal outcomes as proportions
with 95% confidence intervals using Dersimonian
and Laird random effects meta-analysis after
transforming data using Freeman-Tukey double
arcsin transformation. Heterogeneity was reported
as 12 statistics. We undertook subgroup analysis by
country status (high income v low and middle income),
sampling frame (universal, risk based, and symptom
based testing, including not reported), and risk status
of women in the studies (high, low, any). Sensitivity
analysis was performed by restricting the analysis

Results
After removing duplicates from 474 750 citations,
39 5 74 unique citations were identified and 435 cohort
studies (240 comparative, 195 non-comparative) were
included in this second update of the systematic review
(fig 1). All included studies were conducted before the
emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.
Characteristics of included studies
Of the 435 studies, the majority were from the United
States (141, 32.4%), followed by China (8.5%, 37

studies), Spain (6.9%, 30 studies), Italy (6.2%, 27
studies), Turkey (5.1%, 22 studies), India (5.1%,
22 studies), Iran (3.4%, 15 studies) and the United
Kingdom (3.00/0, 13 studies). Seven were multinational
studies. Most studies tested respiratory samples using
RT-PCR (98%, 425/435); 15 studies tested for SARS-
CoV-2 antibodies to confirm the presence of SARS-
CoV-2; 56 studies additionally diagnosed covid-19
based only on clinical suspicion. Twenty seven studies
(3 064 097 women) compared pregnant populations
27-40
with non-pregnant populations,
and 83 studies
(653 470 women) compared pregnant women with
41-87
covid- 19 versus pregnant women without covid- 19.
180 studies reported on clinical manifestations
(173 964 pregnant women, 2006 244 non-pregnant
women), 271 studies reported on covid-19 related
outcomes (237 288 pregnant, 2 706 610 non-pregnant
women), and 222 studies reported on pregnancy
related maternal (78 236 women) and perinatal
outcomes (30385 neonates; see appendix 3). The
sampling frames included universal testing (207
studies), risk based NHCC guidelines (29 studies), and
symptom based (53 studies) strategies. A total of 146
studies did not report the sampling strategy.

Quality of included studies
Overall, 71% (170/240) of the comparative cohort
studies evaluated using the Newcastle Ottawa scale
had an overall low risk of bias (see appendix 4a).
Most (95%, 228/240) had a low risk of bias for study
selection and 12 (5%) had a medium risk. The risk of
bias for comparability of cohorts was low in 146 studies
(61%), medium in 91 (38%), and high in three (1%).
For outcome assessment of the cohorts, 100 (42%)
studies had a low risk of bias, 138 (58%) a medium
risk, and two (1%) a high risk. Quality assessment of
the prevalence studies for external validity showed a
low risk of bias for representativeness in 140/0 (61/435)
of the studies, sampling in 270/0 (116/435), selection in
90% (390/435), and non-response in 99% (430/435).
For internal validity, there was low risk of bias for
data collection in 970/0 (424/435) of the studies, case
definition in 61% (265/435), measurement in 99%
(430/435), differential verification in 98% (427/435),
adequate follow-up in 39% (170/43 5), and appropriate
numerator and denominator in 89% (389/435;(see
appendix 4b).
Rates of covid-19 in pregnant and recently pregnant
women
The overall rate of covid-19 diagnosis in pregnant
and recently pregnant women attending or admitted
to hospital for any reason was 9% (95% confidence
interval 7% to 10%; 149 studies, 926 232 women) (fig
2). Rates varied by sampling strategy. Of the women
tested as part of universal screening strategy, 7% (6%
to 8%; 117 studies, 298199 women) were diagnosed as
having covid-19 compared with 22% (12% to 33%; 15
studies, 8128 women) in women tested on the basis of
symptoms (see appendix 5a). About half of all studies
with a prevalence rate for covid-19 greater than 15%
88-105
were from the US (18/35),
except for two studies
each from the UK, Chile, and India; and one each from
Mexico, Turkey, France, Iran, Cameroon, Egypt, French
106-121
Guiana, Kenya, Norway, Peru, and Spain.
About
one in 30 asymptomatic women (3%, 20/0 to 5%; 39
studies) attending or admitted to hospital had SARS-
CoV-2 infection (see appendix 5b). Two thirds (66%,
54% to 77%; 68 studies) ofthe 11945 pregnant women
with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the universal screening
population were asymptomatic (see appendix 5c).
Non-white ethnicity (odds ratio 2.41, 95% confidence
RESEARCH
interval 1.90 to 3.06; 35 studies; 616 668 women) and
high body mass index (1.24, 1.13 to 1.37; 47 studies,
441583 women), were associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection in pregnancy; none of the other maternal
factors assessed was associated with SARS-CoV-2
infection in pregnant women (see appendix 6a).
Clinical manifestations of covid-19 during
pregnancy and after delivery
The most common symptoms reported by pregnant
and recently pregnant women with suspected or
confirmed covid-19 were fever (36%) and cough
(36%); elevated C reactive protein levels (51%),
elevated procalcitonin levels (32%), lymphopaenia
(33%), and elevated white cell count (28%), were the
most common laboratory findings (fig 3). Compared
with non-pregnant women of reproductive age with
covid- 19, pregnant and recently pregnant women with
the disease were less likely to report symptoms of fever
(odds ratio 0.66, 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 0.86;
15 studies, 2 017 808 women), dyspnoea (0.75, 0.59 to
0.97; 15 studies; 2 017 083 women), cough (0.77, 0.65
to 0.91; 14 studies, 2016 795 women) and myalgia
(0.59, 0.44 to 0.80; 10 studies, 1752452 women)
(fig 4 and fig 5). Pregnant women with covid-19 were
more likely to have pre-existing comorbidities than
non-pregnant women with the disease (1.98, 1.09 to
3.61; 7 studies, 2139 363 women) and less likely to be
of non-white ethnicity (0.78, 0.67 to 0.90; 3 studies,
1398642 women) or >35 years of age (0.41, 0.30 to
0.57; 11 studies, 2302 581 women) (see appendix
6b). Sensitivity analysis restricted to various sampling
frames showed lower estimates of reported symptoms
in the universal screening population and higher
estimates in the symptom based population (see
appendix 7). The rates of clinical manifestations varied
when the analysis was restricted to only women with
RT-PCR confirmed covid-19, unselected populations,
and women with any risk (see appendix 7).
Outcomes related to covid-19 in pregnant and
recently pregnant women
Overall, 970 pregnant women (123 studies, 179 981
women) with confirmed covid-19 died from any cause
(0.2%, 95% confidence interval 0.01% to 0.39%).
Severe covid-19 infection as defined by the authors,
was diagnosed in 9% (7% to 110/6; 82 studies,

with suspected or confirmed covid-19; 40/0 (3% to 5%;
119 studies, 176 686 women) of pregnant women
with covid-19 were admitted to an intensive care unit,
2% (1% to 3%; 72 studies, 168 378 women) required
invasive ventilation, and 0.2% (0.0% to 0.6%; 24

and need for invasive ventilation (2.41, 2.13 to 2.71;
8 studies, 1889174 women) were higher in pregnant
and recently pregnant women (table 1). For every
100 women, two additional women were admitted
to the intensive care unit (risk difference 2.0%,
95% confidence interval 0.5% to 3.1%; 10 studies,
2027 360 women) and two more needed invasive
ventilation (2.0%, 0.0% to 4.0%; eight studies,
1889174 women) when pregnant with covid-19
versus when not pregnant and of reproductive age with
covid-19 (see appendix 9).

Discussion
Findings in this second update of our living systematic
review remain consistent with our original review and
our previous update for prevalence of covid-19, rates
of clinical manifestations, and outcomes in pregnant
and recently pregnant women, in studies published
before the predominance of SARS-CoV-2 variants of
concern. One in 10 pregnant or recently pregnant
women who are attending or admitted to hospital for
any reason were diagnosed as having suspected or
confirmed covid-19, and the rates varied by sampling
strategy. Pregnant and recently pregnant women were
less likely to show covid-19 related symptoms of fever,
dyspnoea, cough, and myalgia than non-pregnant
women with covid-19. Although testing for SARS-
CoV-2 in non-pregnant women is based on symptoms
or contact history, testing in pregnant women is
usually done when they are in hospital for reasons that
might not be related to covid-19. Pregnant or recently
thebmj I doi: 10.1136/bmj.m3320
pregnant women with covid-19 were at increased
risk of requiring admission to an intensive care unit,
and invasive ventilation compared to non-pregnant,
reproductive aged women with covid-19. Increased
maternal age, high body mass index, non-white
ethnicity, pre-existing comorbidities, and pregnancy
specific conditions such as pre-eclampsia and
gestational diabetes are associated with severe disease.
Compared to pregnant women without covid-19,
pregnant women with covid-19 are at increased risk of
death, admission to the intensive care unit, stillbirth,
delivering preterm, and their babies being admitted
to the neonatal unit. However, the overall rates of
stillbirth and neonatal death remain low in women
with suspected or confirmed covid-19. Absolute
increases in maternal deaths, admissions to the
intensive care unit, preterm births, caesarean sections,
and admissions of babies to the neonatal unit were
observed for pregnant women with covid-19 compared
to pregnant women without the disease. Substantial
heterogeneity was observed in the estimates for rates
of clinical manifestations and outcomes, which varied
by sampling frames, participant selection, and risk
status of the participants.
This second update of the living systematic review
includes more than double the number of studies
included in the first update, and four times more
pregnant women with covid-19. There continues to
be increased precision in estimates for previously
identified risk factors for severe disease in pregnant
and recently pregnant women with covid- 19, including
stronger association between risk factors such as non-
white ethnicity, and pregnancy specific conditions
such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia, and
increased risk of adverse outcomes in pregnant women
with covid-19 than without the disease.

Strengths and limitations of this review
In this unprecedented pandemic situation, where
evidence is rapidly produced and published in various
formats, our living systematic review underpinned by
robust methods and continually updated at regular
intervals is important for several reasons. Firstly,
it addresses important research questions relevant
to clinical decision making and policies. Secondly,
uncertainties remain for key outcomes that require
further evidence. Thirdly, the rapid turnover of
evidence in various formats requires assessments of
study quality and regular updating of the findings.
Finally, our living systematic review is producing
strong evidence base for living guidelines on covid-19
and pregnancy.
10
We undertook a comprehensive search and
coordinated our efforts with key organisations and
research groups, such as WHO, US CDC, Cochrane Centre,
and EPPI-Centre. To minimise risk of bias we restricted
our meta-analysis to cohort studies, and we reported
the quality of the included studies. By contacting
the authors and obtaining reports not published in
PubMed, we minimised the risk of missing relevant
studies. Our systematic review has a large sample size,
and it is continuously increasing. Our living review
framework will enable us to rapidly update the findings
as new data emerge. We undertook extensive work to
ensure that duplicate data are not included. Our various
comparative analyses allowed us to comprehensively
assess the association between pregnancy and

covid-19 related outcomes, covid-19 and pregnancy
outcomes, risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and
complications. Our review helps to understand the
variations in estimates through sensitivity analyses by
sampling strategies, population characteristics, and
risk factors, and it provides confidence in the rates of
reported outcomes. The second update has allowed
us to incorporate new evidence from 244 studies and
more than two million women, published since our first
update in February 2021.
Our systematic review also has limitations.
Although our search spans the entire year 2020, none
of the studies included was conducted by the time
of emergence of any SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern.
Despite every effort to quickly update the evidence,
the number of new studies identified and the rigor
required to remove duplicates meant that the review
did not consider current changes in the pandemic such
as variants of concern and vaccination, which could
affect reported prevalence rates and presentation.
The primary studies used varied sampling frames to
identify women with covid-19, consisted of women
with suspected and confirmed covid-19, and primarily
reported on pregnant women who required visits to
hospital, including for childbirth, thereby affecting
the generalisability of the estimates. Although our
thebmj I doi: 10.1136/bmj.m3320
sensitivity analyses aimed to tackle some of these
problems, the numbers and sample sizes of the
individual studies were too small to identify differences
between the subgroups. The timing of assessment of
the clinical manifestations of disease was generally
not available. The definitions of symptoms, tests,
and outcomes were heterogeneous. Furthermore,
poor reporting of the criteria for caesarean section,
admissions to the neonatal unit, and the causes
of preterm birth, made it diffcult to disentangle
iatrogenic effects from direct pathophysiological
effects of the disease. Studies comparing maternal and
perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with covid-19
against historical cohorts of pregnant women, could
be biased owing to differences in the environment in
which births occur. During the pandemic, healthcare
systems have faced increased pressure and strain on
services, with resulting effects on service delivery and
126 127
quality of care.
Lockdown measures, physical
distancing, and changes to livelihood have led to
increased depression and anxiety, and reduction in
physical activity and access or attendance to healthcare
facilities, and could have also contributed to maternal
128
and perinatal complications.
Not many studies reported outcomes by trimester for

miscarriage and postpartum complications. For some
outcomes, the findings were influenced by a few large
studies.
Comparison with existing evidence
Between the publication of the first update of the living
systematic review and this second update, estimates
for the prevalence of covid-19, and rates of clinical
manifestations and outcomes of pregnant and recently
pregnant women with covid-19 have remained similar
with a slight reduction in rates, and improved precision
in findings. We found a reduction in caesarean section
rates and admission to the neonatal unit compared
with the first update, which could be attributed
to increasing knowledge of the disease and better
healthcare practices. The rate of maternal pneumonia
appears to also be lower. High heterogeneity remains
in the estimates for rates of clinical manifestations and
outcomes.
We found that the same risk factors for severe covid- 19
identified in the original version and first update of
the living systematic review remained associated
with severe covid-19 in this second update, with
increased precision. Our findings on the association
of severe covid-19 with ethnic minority status in
pregnant women are consistent with similar reports
of disproportionately high rates of severe covid-19
in non-pregnant ethnic minority populations, 129 and
disparities in other areas of maternity care by ethnic

attributed to associated comorbidities, socioeconomic
characteristics, and factors related to access to and
quality of care in the preconception, pregnancy, and
postpartum periods.132 The multifaceted contributors
to ethnic disparities need to be investigated to reduce
mortality and morbidity related to both covid-19 and
pregnancy. This latest version of our review update
also identified an increased risk of caesarean section,
neonatal death, and stillbirth in pregnant women with
covid-19 compared to pregnant women without the
disease.
Alongside the spread of the pandemic, a shift has
occurred in the types of studies published, with initial
studies involving pregnant women from epidemic
regions in China, followed by reports of large regional
and national datasets from the US, UK, Netherlands,
Spain, and Latin American countries. However, few
reports have come from African countries. The study
design has also changed from initial small case series
and case reports to large observational data, with
recent studies also providing comparative data.
The prevalence of covid-19 varied widely between
studies, particularly when sampling was done based
on symptoms or history of contact, highlighting the
variations in criteria for testing. The current update of
our living systematic review includes twice as many
studies as our first update on the overall prevalence
of covid-19 in pregnancy. Despite the addition of
more studies from diverse populations globally, the
prevalence of covid-19 in pregnant and recently
pregnant women remains unchanged. Unlike the
12
general population who are mostly tested for SARS-
CoV-2 based on symptoms or contact history, universal
screening of all pregnant women attending the hospital
for any reason could contribute to the consistency in
the findings. However, the true prevalence of covid-19
in pregnancy is likely to be lower than the current
estimate if all pregnant women, including those not
attending the hospital are included.
Despite the potential higher possibility of universal
screening to detect pregnant women with mild disease,
we observed an increase in admissions to the intensive
care unit and need for invasive ventilation compared
with non-pregnant women of reproductive age with
covid-19. These results were mainly influenced by
the large US CDC report, 40 the Canadian Surveillance
of covid-19 in pregnancy report, 133 and a report from
the Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology
registry."
By accessing the unpublished data from our
collaborators, we were able to include women
both with and without symptoms from the US CDC
surveillance data, in addition to the women with
symptoms only who were included in the published
report. 40 Pregnancy status was not ascertained in
a large proportion of women of reproductive age in
the CDC report, which could affect the estimates.
Furthermore, the outcomes for which the data were
missing from the report were considered to be absent in
women, potentially leading to bias. The report from the
Mexican General Directorate of Epidemiology registry,
remains available only as a preprint, and included only
women with symptoms who might be at higher risk of
complications. Non-pregnant women in the Canadian
Surveillance report included women years of age
compared to years in the pregnant women group.
We recommend that studies comparing covid-19
related outcomes in pregnant versus non-pregnant
women report the relevant estimates for both women
with and without symptoms to avoid overestimation of
the risk of complications due to selective reporting. The
pooled estimates for severe covid-19 and admission to
an intensive care unit were, however, still relatively
high in the non-comparative data, indicative of a
potential increased risk in pregnancy. This is supported
by an analysis in a Swedish study suggesting a high
risk of admission to an intensive care unit and invasive
ventilation in pregnant women compared to non-
pregnant women, 134 and similar results reported in a
recent French national cohort study suggesting higher
risk of mortality, admission to intensive care unit, and
pregnancy related complications in pregnant women
with covid-19 compared to pregnant women without
135
the disease.
Similar to the general population, high body mass
index and pre-existing comorbidity seemed to be risk
factors for severity of covid-19 in pregnancy, including
admission to an intensive care unit and invasive
ventilation.136 Complications related to covid-19 did
not seem to be increased in women presenting in
the third trimester versus earlier in pregnancy or in
multiparous versus primiparous women—but existing

sample sizes are not large. Both chronic hypertension
and pre-existing diabetes were associated with
maternal death in pregnant women with covid-19,
which are known risk factors for death in the general
population. But it is not known if covid-19 was
the direct cause of death for these women, and the
numbers of studies are small.
We observed an increase in rates of preterm birth
in pregnant women with covid-19 compared with
pregnant women without the disease. These preterm
births could have been medically indicated owing
to maternal disease and resulting fetal distress, as
the overall rates of spontaneous preterm births in
pregnant women with covid-19 was broadly similar
to those observed in the pre-pandemic period. The
overall rates of stillbirths and neonatal deaths, were
still relatively low, with the absolute differences for
stillbirth not significant between the groups. A recent
report from the US CDC found that relative risk of
stillbirth with covid-19 in pregnant women increased
significantly after circulation of the delta variant in the
US, from an adjusted relative risk of 1.47 before delta
dominance to 4.04 during delta dominance.137 Rates
of adverse outcomes should continue to be monitored
as new SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge. Local
policies on observation and quarantine of infants
with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 might have influenced
admission rates to the neonatal unit, which was lower
in this second update than in our first update.
Relevance for clinical practice and research
Based on existing data, healthcare professionals
should be aware that pregnant and recently pregnant
women with covid-19 might manifest fewer symptoms
than the general population, with the overall pattern
similar to that of the general population. Pregnant
women should be informed of the increase in severity
of covid- 19 including admission to intensive care units,
and invasive ventilation compared with non-pregnant
women; and should be encouraged to undertake safety
measures to reduce the risk of infection, including
receiving the covid-19 vaccine to reduce risk of
severe disease. Pregnant women with pre-existing
comorbidities will need to be considered as a high risk
group for covid-19, along with those who are obese
and of older maternal age. Healthcare professionals
need to be aware of the increased risk of severe disease
in pregnant and recently pregnant women of non-
white ethnic origin, to plan close monitoring and have
a low threshold for escalation of care. Clinicians will
need to balance the need for regular multidisciplinary
antenatal care to manage women with pre-existing
comorbidities against unnecessary exposure to the
virus, through virtual clinic appointments when
possible. Pregnant women with covid-19 before term
gestation might need to be managed in a unit with
facilities to care for preterm neonates.
Further data are still needed to robustly assess the
association between pregnancy specific risk factors
(such as pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes)
and covid-19 related outcomes.138 Robust collection

RESEARCH
of maternal data by trimester of exposure, including
the periconception period, is required to determine
the effects of covid-19 on early pregnancy outcomes,
fetal growth, and risk of miscarriage or stillbirth. We
need detailed reporting of outcomes by ethnicity to
quantify the risk of severe covid-19 in women from
different ethnicities. Qualitative studies on behaviour
and attitude to the pandemic can help to disentangle
the relative importance of factors behind the ethnic
disparities observed in the severity of covid-19.
Understanding and dealing with inequities in social
determinants of health that put ethnic minority groups
at higher risk of severe disease can help improve
outcomes in this group.
Evidence syntheses on covid- 19 faces unprecedented
unique challenges, even for agile designs such as
living systematic reviews. Firstly, there is rapid change
in the nature of the virus with emerging variants
of concern, with varied infectivity, presentation,
and outcomes. Primary studies in non-pregnant
and pregnant populations suggest increased risk of
hospital admission and death with the alpha and
delta variants of concern compared with the wildtype
139-142
However, the timeline of most of the
variant.
published literature lags with regards to the emerging
variants of concern. As we update our search beyond
the pre-variant period, we are likely to encounter
new studies reporting on pregnancies before and
after the emergence of variants. In such instances, it
will be inappropriate to update our meta-analysis by
combining all studies.
Secondly, countries are rapidly rolling out covid-19
immunisation programmes, which affects the
prevalence, presentation, and outcomes in general and
pregnant populations. Similar to the methodological
challenges with the variants, it is also inappropriate
to update our meta-analysis without considering
vaccination status.
Thirdly, our living systematic review aims to
synthesise evidence rapidly as they emerge. However,
many primary studies publish partially duplicated
data published elsewhere or at different time points
or report different categories of outcomes for the same
participants in multiple journals. Furthermore, large
numbers of non-peer reviewed scientific papers and
reports are available in the public domain in multiple
versions. Because primary studies do not often
explicitly state if duplicate data have been included,
we had to undertake resource intensive efforts to check
each included study against all studies published
since the beginning of the pandemic to avoid double
counting of participants. This approach led to delays
between completion of the search and finalisation of
data for analysis.
With the establishment of several national and
global prospective cohorts, we expect the sample
size of our meta-analysis to increase further in the
coming months. Future reviews will need to consider
the effects of variants of concerns on the rates of
coivd-19, manifestation of symptoms, and the risk
of covid-19 and pregnancy related complications in

pregnant and recently pregnant women. In doing so,
we propose a shift in how the findings are reported. In
order to capture the trends in prevalence, presentation,
and outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy, in line
with the changing environment in terms of variants
and vaccination status, we plan to synthesise and
present the data according to the time of recruitment
of participants rather than the traditional update by
timing of publication. Providing such data in half-
yearly intervals alongside information on the trends
in variants and vaccine status would provide accurate
information reflecting the underlying conditions.
Including vaccination information within global
systematic reviews of covid-19 and pregnancy will
also allow collection of data on the range of covid-19
vaccines that are in use in different settings, which
can inform international guidelines on vaccination
in pregnancy. This information could lead to stronger
recommendations on covid-19 vaccination for all
pregnant women and help combat misinformation on
vaccination in pregnancy.

ABSTRACT
Background Studies on the health effects of metal mixtures typically utilize biomarkers measured in a single
biological medium, such as blood or urine. However, the ability to evaluate mixture effects are limited by the
uncertainty whether a unified medium can fully capture exposure for each metal. Therefore, it is important to
compare and assess metal mixtures measured in different media in epidemiology studies.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the mixture predictive performance of urine and blood metal
biomarkers and integrated multi-media biomarkers in association with birth outcomes.
Methods: In our analysis of 847 women from the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort, we measured 10 essential and
non-essential metals in repeated and paired samples of urine and blood during pregnancy. For each metal, we
integrated exposure estimates from paired urine and blood biomarkers into multi-media biomarkers (MMBs),
using intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) approaches. Using Ridge re-
gressions, four separate Environmental risk scores (ERSs) for metals in urine, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBvvQs were
computed as a weighted sum of the 10 metal concentrations. We then examined associations between urine,
blood, and multi-media biomarker ERSs and birth outcomes using linear and logistic regressions, adjusting for
maternal age, maternal education, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and second-hand smoke exposure. The
performance of each ERS was evaluated with continuous and tertile estimates and 95% confidence intervals of
the odds ratio of preterm birth using area under the curve (AUC).
Results: Pb was the most important contributor of blood ERS as well as the two integrated multi-media biomarker
ERSs. Individuals with high ERS (3rd tertile) showed increased odds of preterm birth compared to individuals
with low ERS (1st tertile), with 2.8-fold (95% CI, 1.49 to 5.40) for urine (specific gravity corrected); 3.2- fold
(95% CI, 1.68 to 6.25) for blood; 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.72 to 8.66) for multi-media biomarkers composed using ICC;
and 5.2-fold (95% CI, 2.34 to 11.42) for multi-media biomarkers composed using WQS. The four ERSs had
comparable predictive performances (AUC ranging from 0.64 to 0.68) when urine is examined with specific
gravity corrected concentrations.
Conclusions: Within a practical metal panel, measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture. Applications in practical study design require validation of these
methods with other cohorts, larger panels of metals and within the context of other adverse health effects of
interest.

growing interest in the realistic scenario of studying the collective ef-
fects of environmental chemicals on humans, including metals (Taylor
et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018; Signes-Pastor et al., 2019; Govarts et al.,
2016; Luo et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Braun et al., 2016; Berger et al.,
2020; Kalioo et al., 2020a
), biomonitoring has become indispensable in
studies of mixtures. Due to limiting factors such as financial cost and
methodologic challenges, mixture studies based on biomarkers typically
use a unified human specimen (i.e. blood, urine, etc.) to determine
exposure to various chemicals (Singh et al., 2011; Martin and Griswold,
2009; Borowska and Brzoska, 2015; Rehman et al., 2018; Gorman Ng
et al., 2017; Ashrap et al., 2020a
). While this approach may capture
overall exposure to a class of chemicals with similar structure and
pharmacokinetic properties, such as urinary phthalates and blood per-
fluorinated compounds (PFAS), it is more challenging to evaluate
chemical classes such as metals. Because each metal possesses different
pharmacokinetic properties, utilizing one medium for measuring metal
mixtures may not represent exposure for each metal or accurately reflect
overall human exposure. Moreover, for different metals, each medium
may also represent a different window of exposure that provides
important information in relation to the health outcome of interest.
A set of biomarkers reflecting integrated metal mixture information
from multiple media not only reduces the error in the exposure esti-
mation, but also captures different exposure sources and pathways.
Thus, it may be appropriate to combine exposure from different media to
assess human exposure to both single metal and metal mixtures. Previ-
ous studies have proposed different techniques to integrate biomarkers
of exposure to single chemicals, including confirmatory factor analysis
(Budtz-Jørgensen et al., 2003; Grandjean and Budtz-Jørgensen, 2007),
structural equation models (Grandjean and Budtz-Jørgensen, 2007; Kim
et al., 2014; Heilmann et al., 2006), and the derivation of multi-media
biomarkers (MMBs) through mixture methods: non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF), independent component analysis (ICA) and
weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression (Levin-Schwartz et al., 2020).
A few studies have modeled metal mixtures measured in multiple
matrices simultaneously and demonstrated that a combination of
different metal biomarker factors may improve the prediction of health
outcomes (Rechtman et al., 2020; Bauer et al., 2020). Those studies have
validated techniques to select the most important biomarker for each
exposure individually, which has provided useful information for rec-
ommending a more suitable biomarker for a single metal. To our
knowledge, very few epidemiological studies have evaluated the overall
performance of simple metal mixtures (up to 4 metals) measured in
different media in association with health outcomes (Levin-Schwartz
et al., 2021; Sanders et al., 2019
). Therefore, our goals were to assess
whether data on a wide panel of metal mixture exposures measured
using different media can be integrated and compare the performance of
different matrices when assessing the relationship between metal mix-
tures and birth outcomes.
To achieve this goal, we conducted the following study. First, we
proposed ways to integrate multi-media exposure information from
biomarkers measured in different media. Second, we assessed the per-
formance of metal mixtures measured in different media and the com-
bined multi-media exposure as related to health outcomes. We chose
adverse birth outcomes as our outcome of interest because exposure to
metals impacts various biological pathways that contribute to adverse
birth outcomes, including preterm delivery and low birthweight (Kim
et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2011; Diamanti-Kandarakis et al., 2009a; De
Coster and van Larebeke, 2012a; Mendiola et al., 201 la; Bloom et al.,
2010a; Chen et al., 2018; Zota et al., 2009; Ashley-Martin et al., 2018;
Environmental Research 200 (2021) 111435
Mikelson et al., 2018; Eum et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2015; Anderson
et al., 2016; wu et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2016
). Limited mixture studies
on this topic have mostly focused on metals measured in either urine or
blood (
Kim et al., 2018; Signes-Pastor et al., 2019; Govarts et al., 2016;
Luo et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019). In the Puerto Rico PROTECT study, we
measured a wide range of metals in paired urine and blood samples,
which enabled us to compare the associations between adverse birth
outcomes and urinary or blood metal mixtures, as well as integrated
metal mixtures utilizing both matrices. We hypothesized that the use of
urine, blood, and the integrated metal mixtures would demonstrate
differing performance when modeling adverse birth outcomes, inform-
ing more efficient study designs for exposure assessment.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
This study used data collected from 847 pregnant women partici-
pating in the PROTECT study, an ongoing, prospective birth cohort
Cantonwine et al., 2014; Meeker et al., 2013; Watkins et al., 2015,
Ashrap et al., 2018
). The PROTECT study was launched in 2010 with
funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
(NIEHS) Superfund Research Program to investigate Puerto Rico's high
preterm birth rate and the extent of hazardous waste contamination on
the island. PROTECT aims to explore environmental exposures and other
factors contributing to preterm birth risk and other adverse birth out-
comes in Puerto Rico.
Study participants were recruited at approximately 14 ± 2 weeks of
gestation at seven prenatal clinics and hospitals throughout Northern
Puerto Rico and followed until delivery (Cantonwine et al., 2014,
). Pregnant women included in the study were aged
Meeker et al., 2013
between 18 and 40 years, resided inside of the Northern Karst aquifer
region, and were planning to deliver in the participating hospitals.
Exclusion of participants included the use of oral contraceptives within
the three months prior to pregnancy; use of in vitro fertilization to
become pregnant; or any major medical or obstetrical complications,
including pre-existing diabetes (Ashrap et al., 2021a). Each woman
participated in a total of up to three study visits during 18 ± 2 weeks, 22
± 2 weeks, and 26 ± 2 weeks of gestation. At the initial visit, detailed
information on medical and pregnancy history was collected.
Nurse-administered questionnaires were used to gather information on
housing characteristics, employment status, and family situation at an
in-home visit (22 ± 2 weeks). Spot urine samples were collected from
women at up to three visits and blood samples were collected during the
first and third visits. A total of 847 women who delivered a live singleton
birth had available data on 10 paired urine and blood metal biomarkers
(collected at the same time point) as well as information on covariates
Fig. 1)
The research protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research
Committees of the University of Puerto Rico and participating clinics,
the University of Michigan, Northeastern University, and the University
of Georgia. The study was described in detail to all participants, and
informed consent was obtained prior to study enrollment.
2.2. Measurement of metals
Spot urine was collected in sterile polypropylene cups and aliquoted
within 1 h after collection, while blood samples were collected in metal-
free whole blood tubes. All samples were frozen and stored at —80 oc
and shipped on dry ice. Analysis was performed at NSF International
(Ann Arbor, MI, USA), where concentrations of 16 metals and metalloids
were measured in both urine and blood: arsenic (As), barium (Ba),
beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), cesium (cs),
copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), ti-
tanium (Ti), uranium (U), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn); an additional 5
metals and metalloids were measured in urine only: molybdenum (Mo),
2


P. Ashrap et al.
platinum (Pt), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), and tungsten (W). Metal(loid)
concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICPMS) as described previously (
Kim et al., 2018) The
laboratory selected the appropriate isotopes for the requested elements
to best avoid interferences from high levels of carbon and chloride in the
biological sample matrix. The ICPMS was calibrated with a blank and a
minimum of 4 standards for each element of interest. An R2 value of
>0.995 was the minimum criterion for an acceptable calibration curve.
The calibration curves were verified by initial checks at three calibration
points within the curve. Continuing calibration checks and blanks after
every 10 samples were also utilized throughout the analytical run to
ensure the ICPMS system was maintaining acceptable performance.
Urinary specific gravity (SG) was measured at the University of Puerto
Rico Medical Sciences Campus using a hand-held digital refractometer
(Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as an indicator of urine dilution.
2.3. Preterm birth and auxiliary birth outcomes
All birth outcome data were extracted from medical records. We used
the American Congress of Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations to
calculate gestational age at birth (Committee on Obstetric Practice,
), as previously described in detail (Aker et al., 2019a; Ferguson
2017
et al., 2019a
). In this study, preterm birth was defined as delivery <37
Environmental Research 200 (2021) 111435
completed weeks of gestation, as per common practice. Preterm birth
can be classed into two groups, based on the clinical presentation of
preterm delivery: medically indicated preterm birth (preterm births
with preeclampsia, or with both artificial membrane rupture and
induced labor) and spontaneous preterm birth (presentation of prema-
ture rupture of the membranes, spontaneous preterm labor, or both). In
our analysis, the outcome of interest was overall and spontaneous pre-
term birth.
Other birth outcomes, including gestational age, and fetal growth
outcomes [birthweight z-score, small for gestational age (SGA), and
large for gestational age (LGA)], were also included in our analysis as
auxiliary outcomes. INTERGROWTH-21st standard gestational age- and
sex-specific birthweight z-scores were constructed and used in the
analysis (Villar et al., 2014). SGA and LGA births were defined as below
the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of birthweight
z-scores, respectively.
2.4. Statistical methods
To account for urinary dilution, metal concentrations in urine were
corrected for SG using the equation: Pc — P[(SGp — 1)/(SGi — 1)]; where
Pc is the SG-corrected biomarker concentration (ng/mL), P is the
measured biomarker concentration, SGp is the median urinary specific

gravity in this population (1.019), and SGi is the individual's urinary
specific gravity. Metal concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD)
were replaced by LOD/ V 2. The geometric averages of participant con-
centrations across the visits were calculated for each SG-corrected uri-
1201, visit 2 592, visit 3 — 744) and blood (visit 1
nary (visit 1
1071, visit 3 662) metal. In the case of a missing value at one of the
study visits, the average for urine biomarkers was taken of the two
remaining concentrations and the average for blood biomarker was
equal to the single available concentration. In the case of two missing
urine measurement, the "average" metal concentration was equal to the
single available concentration. After these steps of preprocessing, metals
that were measured in paired media (have both urinary and blood
geometric average measurements) and had at least 50% of samples with
concentrations above the LOD in both matrices were included in sta-
tistical analysis.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all exposures and outcome
variables. We applied natural logarithmic transformation to all urinary
and blood metals because the distributions were right-skewed prior to
transformation. Spearman's rank correlations (rs) were used for the
analysis of the relationships between paired urinary and blood metal
average concentrations. Data were analyzed using R version 3.6.2. A
schematic representation of the data accumulation and analytic pro-
cedure is also presented in
Fig. 1
2.4.1. MMB composition
In this analysis, we proposed two approaches to integrate exposure
information from urinary and blood metal measurements into a multi-
media biomarker (MMB). In the first approach, inspired by the
concept of cue combination in quantitative cognitive neurosciences (the
minimum-variance unbiased estimator for multiple sources of informa-
tion), we used an internal reliability indicator of the biomarkers to
integrate MMB (unsupervised method). In the second approach, which is
a supervised method, weighted quantile sum (WQS) models were used
because the relative contribution of the individual biomarkers to the
overall exposure and health outcome association is easier to interpret
than many other mixtures methods. The details of the approaches are
described below.
2.4.1.1. Integrating multi-media biomarker (MMB) using intraclass corre-
lation coefficient (ICC). Characterizing the within- and between-
individual variation of measurements with parameters such as intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC) gives information on the reliability of
the different media biomarkers. ICC is defined as the proportion of the
Wi—l
total variance that is attributed to between-individual variability:
MMB
W blood C] blood
ICC W u urine
(4)
where w is the weight of a medium (Wurinegcq + VVblood[1CCl l)expresses
whether a certain medium (urine or blood) as a biomarker for a
particular metal is a relatively reliable biomarker and C is the geometric
average of metal concentration.
2.4.1.2. Integrating multi-media biomarker (MMB) using weighted quantile
sum regression (WQS). In addition to the unsupervised learning method,
the amount of exposure information each biomarker carries can be
quantified simultaneously based on the relationship of the exposure
measured in a certain medium and health effect—a supervised approach.
Therefore, the second approach for integrating urinary and blood bio-
markers was weighted quantile sum regression (WQS), which models
the body burden of quantiles of exposure. WQS estimates a set of
weights, such that the linear combinations of the weights * quantile
biomarkers have the highest association with the outcome (Carrico
et al., 2015
) (equation (5)). Details of the WQS equation and annotations
are previously described (Yorita Christensen et al., 2013). In our anal-
ysis, Wi is the unknown weight for the ith medium (1 urine, 2 blood,
c — 2), z represents a vector of adjusted covariates, and (P is a vector of
regression coefficients for those covariates. By placing the constraints of
the weight (WD estimates to be non-negative and sum to 1, the
comparative values of urine and blood metals to multi-media bio-
markers and the joint effect can be determined. The weights can then be
used to quantify the contribution of each medium to the multi-media
biomarker. In this supervised learning approach, we used WQS (100
bootstraps) to determine the association between each birth outcome
and urinary and blood biomarkers of each metal, separately. A pre-
liminary analysis was conducted before the construction of WQS models.
As WQS assumes linearity, in an effort to detect potential non-linear
relationships between individual metals and birth outcomes, we used
generalized additive models (GAM) to graphically depict the metal and
birth outcome relationship. Results from GAM including metal concen-
trations as splines and the GAM output graphics showed that when the
smoothing estimator is significant the observed associations are linear
(estimated degree of freedom 1). Therefore, we proceeded with WQS.
All outcomes were regressed on the geometric averages of SG-corrected
urinary and blood concentrations across all the available visits. Then we
combined the weights to generate multi-media biomarkers using equa-
Uon (6).

2.4.2. Single-pollutant analysis

In epidemiological studies with repeated measurements, the ICC
metric, ranging from O to 1, indicates reliability among multiple mea-
surements of a quantity; when close to O, ICC reflects large variations
between repeated measures, a. k.a. poor ability to distinguish between
individuals with high and low exposure levels; when close to 1, the
repeated measures are close to each other which reflects a good ability to
discriminate between individuals with high and low exposure levels. In
this unsupervised machine learning approach, we utilized the ICCs
calculated from repeated measurements of SG-corrected urinary (up to
three visits) and blood metals (up to two visits) (Ashrap et al., 2020a) as
weighting parameters to construct an integrated MMB separately for
each metal using equations

Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to examine the associ-
ations between four types of metal biomarkers measured and composed
(urinary, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBwQs) and birth outcomes. Separate
models were used for each metal biomarker and outcome (e.g., Mn:
MMB1cc and gestational age). As both MMBs described above are
composed using the geometric mean of SG-corrected urinary and blood
metal concentrations, geometric average concentrations across all the
available visits were also used for individual urinary and blood models
in this single-pollutant analysis. Geometric mean of urinary, blood and
MMB biomarker concentrations were split in to tertiles (risk stratifica-
tion purposes). The full models included the tertiles of metal biomarker
concentrations and a final set of covariates that were selected based on a
priori knowledge and whether their inclusion appreciably changed the
effect estimates of metal exposure (Ashrap et al., 2020b). These cova-
riates were maternal age, maternal education level, pre-pregnancy BMI,
and exposure to second-hand smoking. Effect estimates and 95% con-
fidence intervals were calculated for the highest versus the lowest

tertiles of exposure to measure the risk stratification properties of in-
dividual metals and compare them to the collective effects of metal
mixtures as described below.
2.4.3. Mixture analysis
2.4.3.1. Construction of environmental risk scores (ERSs) using ridge
regression. Environmental Risk Score (ERS) was proposed as a potential
summary measure for the effects of mixtures in epidemiologic research
(Park et al., 2014
). The concept of ERS is to build a predictive risk model
as a weighted sum of the exposure levels from simultaneous assessment
of the all the pollutants in the mixture. Weights are determined by the
magnitudes (standardized regression coefficients) of the association
between each exposure and the outcome of interest (
Park et al., 2014)
We constructed Environmental Risk Scores (ERSs) as weighted summary
measures of the effects of metals where the weights were regression
coefficients derived from models of the association between metal
mixtures and the outcome of interest. We utilized Ridge regression to
guide the weight of each metal in relation to preterm birth. Ridge
regression is a regularized regression technique, and it is one of the
commonly used supervised machine learning solutions (
Hoerl and
). Ridge is used to constrain the size of the estimated
Kennard, 1970
coefficients, and the objective function for a continuous outcome can be

package in R (Robin et al., 2011)). For binary outcome models with ERS
tertiles, we also computed the odds ratio (OR) for the highest tertile
versus the lowest tertile to measure the risk stratification properties of
ERS.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive analysis
Demographic characteristics of the 847 women in this analysis are
summarized in
and were described previously (Ashrap et al.,
Table 1
2018; Aker et al., 2019b
). Mothers included in our analysis had similar
demographic characteristics to the overall PROTECT population (Fer
guson et al., 2019b). Briefly, the cohort included women in their late 20s
(median 27 years) and half of them had a BMI less than 25 kg/m2 prior
to pregnancy. The majority of women (57%) had private medical

riates for the ith subject, and Yi is the continuous health outcome for the
ith subject. Ridge regression utilizes the regularization penalty param-
eter), (A e [O, 00)) to solve the multicollinearity problem and control the
shrinkage of the L2 penalty. Ridge regression decreases the complexity
of the models and enforces the coefficients to be lower without forcing
them to be zero (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970; Tibshirani, 1996
The in-
dividual associations are not constrained to be in the same direction in
Ridge regression. Therefore, Ridge regression was ideal in this setting as
our analytic purpose was to evaluate the same full set of metals as
mixtures across different media and integrated biomarkers that have
different directions of individual metal-birth outcome associations.
Using Ridge regression with an underlying model including biomarkers
of 10 metals and covariates, we performed 10-fold cross-validation and
selected the value that minimized the cross-validated sum of squared
residuals (
Park et al., 2014, 2017
). Four separate ERSs for metals in
urine, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBwQs were computed as a weighted sum
of the 10 metal concentrations (C):

2.4.3.2. ERS models and evaluations. In order to assess risk stratification
power of the different ERSs, we further categorized ERS by its tertiles.
We then refit the regression models with both continuous and categor-
ical ERSs to examine its associations with preterm birth as well as the
auxiliary birth outcomes. We conceptualized the ERSs as a weighted sum
of metal exposure measured in urine, blood, and multi-media bio-
markers composed by WQS and ICC methods, namely, ERSurine, ERS-
blood, ERSMMB_wQs, and ERSMMB_Icc. ROC (Receiver Operating
Characteristics) curves were used to evaluate the preterm, spontaneous
preterm birth, SGA, and LGA classification model performances of four
ERSs. Specifically, the area under curve (AUC) of ROC were computed
for quantifying and visualizing the biomarkers' classification accuracy
for the above-mentioned binary outcomes. We used a bootstrap resam-
pling (2000 iterations) to compute 95% confidence intervals of AUCs for
different models (Carpenter and Bithell, 2000) and to test the difference
between AUCs (the ci. auc() and roc. test() functions in the PROC
847).

3.1.1. MMB composition
The weights of urinary and blood metals in the composition of MMBs
from ICC and WQS approaches are depicted in
Fig. 2. As the ICC
approach is based on an unsupervised learning method, the metal
biomarker weights are the same across the birth outcomes. In contrast,
the WQS approach is a supervised learning method, therefore, the
weights constructed for each of the metal biomarkers were different for
the respective birth outcomes. The corresponding urinary and blood
weights (WQS) for each birth outcome are presented in Supplementary
while

weights for those metals were higher from the WQS approach than the
ICC approach, except for Mn and Pb where the blood weights were
higher from the ICC approach (60% and 88%) than the WQS approach
(56% and 72%). In contrast, MMB for As was mostly attributed to urine
from the WQS approach (95%).
3.1.2. ERSs
ERS weights derived from Ridge models regressing preterm and
spontaneous preterm birth on metal mixtures are shown in
Fig. 3. The
values of the weights for all the outcomes are provided in Supplemen-
tary Table 3. The largest contributors to preterm birth ERS from urine
mixture were Cd (—0.01), Ni (—0.008), and As (—0.006). For preterm
birth ERSs constructed from the blood, MMB1cc, and MMBvvQs mixtures,
Pb and Mn were the largest positive weight contributors for all three. A
similar weight distribution was observed for spontaneous preterm birth.
The preterm birth ERSs from each biomarker mixture were normally
distributed and ranged from —0.06 to 0.04 for urine; —0.13 to 0.88 for
blood; -0.001 to 0.11 for MMBIcc; and 0.08 to 0.48 for MMBwQs. For
preterm birth ERSs, pairwise correlations among urine ERS and other
ERSs were weak (r < 0.2), whereas blood ERS had relatively higher
correlations with the ERSs for MMB1cc (r — 0.88) and MMBwQs (r —
0.53). The weight distribution for spontaneous preterm birth ERSs were
similar to overall preterm birth ERS weights.

Changes in auxiliary birth outcomes associated with ERSs are shown in
Supplementary Table 4. When spontaneous preterm birth is regressed on
the four ERSs, odds ratios were generally higher compared to the overall
preterm birth models, ranging from 2.34 (95% CI: 1.53, 3.56) to 2.56
(95% CI: 1.58, 4.14). For fetal growth outcomes, all ERSs were signifi-
cantly associated with lower birthweight z-scores; the associations be-
tween ERSs and SGA were stronger (OR: 1.54 to 1.99) than the
associations between ERSs and LGA (OR: 1.32 to 1.53) (Supplementary

indicating that urine, blood, and two MMB ERSs had comparable pre-
dictive performance in these models. Predictive performances of ERS on
other binary outcomes followed similar patterns; performances of urine,
blood, and MMB biomarkers were comparable, with AUC ranging from
0.66 to 0.69 for spontaneous preterm birth, from 0.60 to 0.65 for SGA,
and from 0.60 to 0.62 for LGA.
In an additional analysis, to illustrate the difference in the urine
biomarker performance between disregarding versus accounting for
urine dilution, we reported the odds ratio associated with both uncor-
rected and SG-corrected urine ERSs. Therefore, the performance was
compared between metal mixtures measured in uncorrected urine, SG-
corrected urine, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBwQs. The results are pre-
sented in Supplementary Table 4

was no significant association between uncorrected urine ERS and pre-
term birth, and the odds ratios for other ERS associations were greater
than the odds ratio for the uncorrected urine metal ERS. The p values in
Supplementary Figure 1 represent the significance of the test results for
comparing the predictive performances (preterm birth) of different ERSs
using AUC. The uncorrected urine ERS showed lower prediction per-
formance than SG-corrected urine (p — 0.04), blood ERS (p — 0.02),
MMBIcc ERS (p — 0.003), and MMBwQs ERS (p 0.07). This indicates
that the area under the uncorrected urine ERS curve (AUC — 0.61; 95%
CI 0.54—0.68) is significantly smaller than the other AUCs shown in
Fig. 5: SG-corrected urine ERS (AUC 0.64; 950/6C1 0.58-0.71), the
blood ERS (AUC — 0.68; 95%C1 0.62-0.74), MMBIcc ERS (AUC
0.61-0.73), and MMBwQs (AUC — 0.68; 95%C1
0.67; 95%C1 —
0.62-0.74).
Because Pb was the most important contributor of preterm birth
blood ERS as well as the two MMB ERSs, we conducted another addi-
tional analysis excluding Pb from Ridge models while constructing and
evaluating the performance of the ERSs. The effect estimates from this
analysis for all four (urine, blood, MMB1cc, MMBwQs) ERS were atten-
uated compared to the primary analyses (Supplementary Table 5)
Continuous blood ERS was no longer significantly associated with pre-
term birth (OR/IQR 1.03, 95% Cl 0.77 to 1.37, p — 0.83). The effect
estimates for urine ERS was 1.73 (95% Cl 1.22 to 2.43, p — 0.002),
MMBIcc was 1.83 (95% Cl 1.23 to 2.54, p < 0.001), and was

metal exposure. From a risk stratification perspective, integration of
urine and blood biomarkers that were derived from both ICC and WQS
approaches improved the model performance in the mixture models
compared to the sole urine or blood biomarker models. Although the
confidence intervals for these odds ratio estimates were wider, the MMB
integration, especially using the WQS approach, resulted in substantially
higher effect estimate. This finding supports that while multiple mea-
surements of the exposure mixture may measure metal body burden
differentially, there may still be room for improvement for exposure
measurement error structure and effect estimate when incorporating
urinary and blood biomarker information.
4.1. Strengths and limitations
Specific strengths of our study include its longitudinal design in
which repeated urinary and blood biomarkers provided more accurate
exposure information during pregnancy. This allowed us to quantify the
temporal reliability of the two media measurements (ICCs), which were
further used as weights to integrate the multi-media measure of expo-
sure. Secondly, this study utilized data-driven machine learning ap-
proaches to 1) inform the composition of multi-media metal biomarkers
measured in different media and 2) guide the construction of environ-
mental risk scores for each medium reflecting the overall exposure to the
metal mixture. Finally, this study evaluated the health effects of multiple
metals simultaneously and compared the performance of different
media biomarkers and integrated biomarkers in relation to adverse birth
outcomes in the context of a mixture. The results lay the groundwork for
future epidemiological studies on biomarker selection when examining
the mixture effects of metals.
However, our study has several limitations. The relatively small
sample size did not allow cross-validation within this population on ERS,
which may have caused overfitting of ERS. Future studies with a larger
sample size should implement training and test datasets to cross-validate
ERSs. Studies with larger sample sizes are also needed to address po-
tential improvement of models by including non-linear terms and in-
teractions between metals and covariates that were not accounted for in
the current analysis. Depending on the pharmacokinetics of each
chemical within a family, mixture studies, in general, are challenged by
the complications of combining chemical biomarkers where each may
be representing a unique window of exposure. While our ERS estimates
also suffered from this limitation, by combining multi-media exposure
using both urine and blood biomarkers, we were able to reduce the
measurement error in the mixture analysis to an extent. Because the
average concentrations of metal biomarkers across three visits were used
in this analysis, windows of vulnerability during pregnancy were not
evaluated. Given that associations between metal mixtures and birth
outcomes may depend on developmental time windows, it is important
for future longitudinal studies to evaluate the temporality of the asso-
ciations. In addition, while we evaluated a mixture of 10 essential and
non-essential metals, it is possible that other metals that were not
assessed in our study affect the performance of urine or blood bio-
markers. Future work is needed to expand the mixture evaluation to
include more metals and other biospecimens including hair and saliva,
as well as other adverse health outcomes because our results may not be
generalizable to other outcomes of interest. Finally, while the mixture of
metals in this study is representative of exposures experienced by Puerto
Rican populations, it may not accurately reflect exposure profiles for
other populations.
5. Conclusions
Our study used innovative methodology to provide new detailed
insights into the individual and integrated associations of urinary and
blood mixture biomarkers of metal exposure with birth outcomes. Our
investigation demonstrates, within practical metal analytical panels,
that measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
Environmental Research 200 (2021) 111435
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture. The results of our study
elucidate the importance of considering the overall mixture perfor-
mance of a certain medium. Future studies are needed to expand to
evaluate the performance with different metal panels, media, health
outcomes of interest, and methods to integrate exposure information, to
further address how to most effectively study the health impacts of
exposure to mixtures.

ABSTRACT
Background Studies on the health effects of metal mixtures typically utilize biomarkers measured in a single
biological medium, such as blood or urine. However, the ability to evaluate mixture effects are limited by the
uncertainty whether a unified medium can fully capture exposure for each metal. Therefore, it is important to
compare and assess metal mixtures measured in different media in epidemiology studies.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the mixture predictive performance of urine and blood metal
biomarkers and integrated multi-media biomarkers in association with birth outcomes.
Methods: In our analysis of 847 women from the Puerto Rico PROTECT Cohort, we measured 10 essential and
non-essential metals in repeated and paired samples of urine and blood during pregnancy. For each metal, we
integrated exposure estimates from paired urine and blood biomarkers into multi-media biomarkers (MMBs),
using intraclass-correlation coefficient (ICC) and weighted quantile sum (WQS) approaches. Using Ridge re-
gressions, four separate Environmental risk scores (ERSs) for metals in urine, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBvvQs were
computed as a weighted sum of the 10 metal concentrations. We then examined associations between urine,
blood, and multi-media biomarker ERSs and birth outcomes using linear and logistic regressions, adjusting for
maternal age, maternal education, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), and second-hand smoke exposure. The
performance of each ERS was evaluated with continuous and tertile estimates and 95% confidence intervals of
the odds ratio of preterm birth using area under the curve (AUC).
Results: Pb was the most important contributor of blood ERS as well as the two integrated multi-media biomarker
ERSs. Individuals with high ERS (3rd tertile) showed increased odds of preterm birth compared to individuals
with low ERS (1st tertile), with 2.8-fold (95% CI, 1.49 to 5.40) for urine (specific gravity corrected); 3.2- fold
(95% CI, 1.68 to 6.25) for blood; 3.9-fold (95% CI, 1.72 to 8.66) for multi-media biomarkers composed using ICC;
and 5.2-fold (95% CI, 2.34 to 11.42) for multi-media biomarkers composed using WQS. The four ERSs had
comparable predictive performances (AUC ranging from 0.64 to 0.68) when urine is examined with specific
gravity corrected concentrations.
Conclusions: Within a practical metal panel, measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture. Applications in practical study design require validation of these
methods with other cohorts, larger panels of metals and within the context of other adverse health effects of
interest.

1. Introduction
Exposure biomonitoring, which estimates human exposure by
measuring chemical or other agents of interest or their metabolic
products in different biologic media, such as blood and urine (Strimbu
), has become a fundamental approach used in exposure
and Tavel, 2010
assessment and environmental epidemiology (
Burke et al., 2006
). With
growing interest in the realistic scenario of studying the collective ef-
fects of environmental chemicals on humans, including metals (Taylor
et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2018; Signes-Pastor et al., 2019; Govarts et al.,
2016; Luo et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019; Braun et al., 2016; Berger et al.,
2020; Kalioo et al., 2020a
), biomonitoring has become indispensable in
studies of mixtures. Due to limiting factors such as financial cost and
methodologic challenges, mixture studies based on biomarkers typically
use a unified human specimen (i.e. blood, urine, etc.) to determine
exposure to various chemicals (Singh et al., 2011; Martin and Griswold,
2009; Borowska and Brzoska, 2015; Rehman et al., 2018; Gorman Ng
et al., 2017; Ashrap et al., 2020a
). While this approach may capture
overall exposure to a class of chemicals with similar structure and
pharmacokinetic properties, such as urinary phthalates and blood per-
fluorinated compounds (PFAS), it is more challenging to evaluate
chemical classes such as metals. Because each metal possesses different
pharmacokinetic properties, utilizing one medium for measuring metal
mixtures may not represent exposure for each metal or accurately reflect
overall human exposure. Moreover, for different metals, each medium
may also represent a different window of exposure that provides
important information in relation to the health outcome of interest.
A set of biomarkers reflecting integrated metal mixture information
from multiple media not only reduces the error in the exposure esti-
mation, but also captures different exposure sources and pathways.
Thus, it may be appropriate to combine exposure from different media to
assess human exposure to both single metal and metal mixtures. Previ-
ous studies have proposed different techniques to integrate biomarkers
of exposure to single chemicals, including confirmatory factor analysis
(Budtz-Jørgensen et al., 2003; Grandjean and Budtz-Jørgensen, 2007),
structural equation models (Grandjean and Budtz-Jørgensen, 2007; Kim
et al., 2014; Heilmann et al., 2006), and the derivation of multi-media
biomarkers (MMBs) through mixture methods: non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF), independent component analysis (ICA) and
weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression (Levin-Schwartz et al., 2020).
A few studies have modeled metal mixtures measured in multiple
matrices simultaneously and demonstrated that a combination of
different metal biomarker factors may improve the prediction of health
outcomes (Rechtman et al., 2020; Bauer et al., 2020). Those studies have
validated techniques to select the most important biomarker for each
exposure individually, which has provided useful information for rec-
ommending a more suitable biomarker for a single metal. To our
knowledge, very few epidemiological studies have evaluated the overall
performance of simple metal mixtures (up to 4 metals) measured in
different media in association with health outcomes (Levin-Schwartz
et al., 2021; Sanders et al., 2019
). Therefore, our goals were to assess
whether data on a wide panel of metal mixture exposures measured
using different media can be integrated and compare the performance of
different matrices when assessing the relationship between metal mix-
tures and birth outcomes.
To achieve this goal, we conducted the following study. First, we
proposed ways to integrate multi-media exposure information from
biomarkers measured in different media. Second, we assessed the per-
formance of metal mixtures measured in different media and the com-
bined multi-media exposure as related to health outcomes. We chose
adverse birth outcomes as our outcome of interest because exposure to
metals impacts various biological pathways that contribute to adverse
birth outcomes, including preterm delivery and low birthweight (Kim
et al., 2018; Singh et al., 2011; Diamanti-Kandarakis et al., 2009a; De
Coster and van Larebeke, 2012a; Mendiola et al., 201 la; Bloom et al.,
2010a; Chen et al., 2018; Zota et al., 2009; Ashley-Martin et al., 2018;
Environmental Research 200 (2021) 111435
Mikelson et al., 2018; Eum et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2015; Anderson
et al., 2016; wu et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2016
). Limited mixture studies
on this topic have mostly focused on metals measured in either urine or
blood (
Kim et al., 2018; Signes-Pastor et al., 2019; Govarts et al., 2016;
Luo et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019). In the Puerto Rico PROTECT study, we
measured a wide range of metals in paired urine and blood samples,
which enabled us to compare the associations between adverse birth
outcomes and urinary or blood metal mixtures, as well as integrated
metal mixtures utilizing both matrices. We hypothesized that the use of
urine, blood, and the integrated metal mixtures would demonstrate
differing performance when modeling adverse birth outcomes, inform-
ing more efficient study designs for exposure assessment.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
This study used data collected from 847 pregnant women partici-
pating in the PROTECT study, an ongoing, prospective birth cohort
Cantonwine et al., 2014; Meeker et al., 2013; Watkins et al., 2015,
Ashrap et al., 2018
). The PROTECT study was launched in 2010 with
funding from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
(NIEHS) Superfund Research Program to investigate Puerto Rico's high
preterm birth rate and the extent of hazardous waste contamination on
the island. PROTECT aims to explore environmental exposures and other
factors contributing to preterm birth risk and other adverse birth out-
comes in Puerto Rico.
Study participants were recruited at approximately 14 ± 2 weeks of
gestation at seven prenatal clinics and hospitals throughout Northern
Puerto Rico and followed until delivery (Cantonwine et al., 2014,
). Pregnant women included in the study were aged
Meeker et al., 2013
between 18 and 40 years, resided inside of the Northern Karst aquifer
region, and were planning to deliver in the participating hospitals.
Exclusion of participants included the use of oral contraceptives within
the three months prior to pregnancy; use of in vitro fertilization to
become pregnant; or any major medical or obstetrical complications,
including pre-existing diabetes (Ashrap et al., 2021a). Each woman
participated in a total of up to three study visits during 18 ± 2 weeks, 22
± 2 weeks, and 26 ± 2 weeks of gestation. At the initial visit, detailed
information on medical and pregnancy history was collected.
Nurse-administered questionnaires were used to gather information on
housing characteristics, employment status, and family situation at an
in-home visit (22 ± 2 weeks). Spot urine samples were collected from
women at up to three visits and blood samples were collected during the
first and third visits. A total of 847 women who delivered a live singleton
birth had available data on 10 paired urine and blood metal biomarkers
(collected at the same time point) as well as information on covariates
Fig. 1)
The research protocol was approved by the Ethics and Research
Committees of the University of Puerto Rico and participating clinics,
the University of Michigan, Northeastern University, and the University
of Georgia. The study was described in detail to all participants, and
informed consent was obtained prior to study enrollment.
2.2. Measurement of metals
Spot urine was collected in sterile polypropylene cups and aliquoted
within 1 h after collection, while blood samples were collected in metal-
free whole blood tubes. All samples were frozen and stored at —80 oc
and shipped on dry ice. Analysis was performed at NSF International
(Ann Arbor, MI, USA), where concentrations of 16 metals and metalloids
were measured in both urine and blood: arsenic (As), barium (Ba),
beryllium (Be), cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), cesium (cs),
copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), ti-
tanium (Ti), uranium (U), vanadium (V), and zinc (Zn); an additional 5
metals and metalloids were measured in urine only: molybdenum (Mo),

platinum (Pt), antimony (Sb), tin (Sn), and tungsten (W). Metal(loid)
concentrations were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (ICPMS) as described previously (
Kim et al., 2018) The
laboratory selected the appropriate isotopes for the requested elements
to best avoid interferences from high levels of carbon and chloride in the
biological sample matrix. The ICPMS was calibrated with a blank and a
minimum of 4 standards for each element of interest. An R2 value of
>0.995 was the minimum criterion for an acceptable calibration curve.
The calibration curves were verified by initial checks at three calibration
points within the curve. Continuing calibration checks and blanks after
every 10 samples were also utilized throughout the analytical run to
ensure the ICPMS system was maintaining acceptable performance.
Urinary specific gravity (SG) was measured at the University of Puerto
Rico Medical Sciences Campus using a hand-held digital refractometer
(Atago Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as an indicator of urine dilution.
2.3. Preterm birth and auxiliary birth outcomes
All birth outcome data were extracted from medical records. We used
the American Congress of Gynecologists (ACOG) recommendations to
calculate gestational age at birth (Committee on Obstetric Practice,
), as previously described in detail (Aker et al., 2019a; Ferguson
2017
et al., 2019a
). In this study, preterm birth was defined as delivery <37
Environmental Research 200 (2021) 111435
completed weeks of gestation, as per common practice. Preterm birth
can be classed into two groups, based on the clinical presentation of
preterm delivery: medically indicated preterm birth (preterm births
with preeclampsia, or with both artificial membrane rupture and
induced labor) and spontaneous preterm birth (presentation of prema-
ture rupture of the membranes, spontaneous preterm labor, or both). In
our analysis, the outcome of interest was overall and spontaneous pre-
term birth.
Other birth outcomes, including gestational age, and fetal growth
outcomes [birthweight z-score, small for gestational age (SGA), and
large for gestational age (LGA)], were also included in our analysis as
auxiliary outcomes. INTERGROWTH-21st standard gestational age- and
sex-specific birthweight z-scores were constructed and used in the
analysis (Villar et al., 2014). SGA and LGA births were defined as below
the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of birthweight
z-scores, respectively.
2.4. Statistical methods
To account for urinary dilution, metal concentrations in urine were
corrected for SG using the equation: Pc — P[(SGp — 1)/(SGi — 1)]; where
Pc is the SG-corrected biomarker concentration (ng/mL), P is the
measured biomarker concentration, SGp is the median urinary specific

gravity in this population (1.019), and SGi is the individual's urinary
specific gravity. Metal concentrations below the limit of detection (LOD)
were replaced by LOD/ V 2. The geometric averages of participant con-
centrations across the visits were calculated for each SG-corrected uri-
1201, visit 2 592, visit 3 — 744) and blood (visit 1
nary (visit 1
1071, visit 3 662) metal. In the case of a missing value at one of the
study visits, the average for urine biomarkers was taken of the two
remaining concentrations and the average for blood biomarker was
equal to the single available concentration. In the case of two missing
urine measurement, the "average" metal concentration was equal to the
single available concentration. After these steps of preprocessing, metals
that were measured in paired media (have both urinary and blood
geometric average measurements) and had at least 50% of samples with
concentrations above the LOD in both matrices were included in sta-
tistical analysis.
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all exposures and outcome
variables. We applied natural logarithmic transformation to all urinary
and blood metals because the distributions were right-skewed prior to
transformation. Spearman's rank correlations (rs) were used for the
analysis of the relationships between paired urinary and blood metal
average concentrations. Data were analyzed using R version 3.6.2. A
schematic representation of the data accumulation and analytic pro-
cedure is also presented in
Fig. 1
2.4.1. MMB composition
In this analysis, we proposed two approaches to integrate exposure
information from urinary and blood metal measurements into a multi-
media biomarker (MMB). In the first approach, inspired by the
concept of cue combination in quantitative cognitive neurosciences (the
minimum-variance unbiased estimator for multiple sources of informa-
tion), we used an internal reliability indicator of the biomarkers to
integrate MMB (unsupervised method). In the second approach, which is
a supervised method, weighted quantile sum (WQS) models were used
because the relative contribution of the individual biomarkers to the
overall exposure and health outcome association is easier to interpret
than many other mixtures methods. The details of the approaches are
described below.
2.4.1.1. Integrating multi-media biomarker (MMB) using intraclass corre-
lation coefficient (ICC). Characterizing the within- and between-
individual variation of measurements with parameters such as intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC) gives information on the reliability of
the different media biomarkers. ICC is defined as the proportion of the
Wi—l
total variance that is attributed to between-individual variability:
MMB
W blood C] blood
ICC W u urine
(4)
where w is the weight of a medium (Wurinegcq + VVblood[1CCl l)expresses
whether a certain medium (urine or blood) as a biomarker for a
particular metal is a relatively reliable biomarker and C is the geometric
average of metal concentration.
2.4.1.2. Integrating multi-media biomarker (MMB) using weighted quantile
sum regression (WQS). In addition to the unsupervised learning method,
the amount of exposure information each biomarker carries can be
quantified simultaneously based on the relationship of the exposure
measured in a certain medium and health effect—a supervised approach.
Therefore, the second approach for integrating urinary and blood bio-
markers was weighted quantile sum regression (WQS), which models
the body burden of quantiles of exposure. WQS estimates a set of
weights, such that the linear combinations of the weights * quantile
biomarkers have the highest association with the outcome (Carrico
et al., 2015
) (equation (5)). Details of the WQS equation and annotations
are previously described (Yorita Christensen et al., 2013). In our anal-
ysis, Wi is the unknown weight for the ith medium (1 urine, 2 blood,
c — 2), z represents a vector of adjusted covariates, and (P is a vector of
regression coefficients for those covariates. By placing the constraints of
the weight (WD estimates to be non-negative and sum to 1, the
comparative values of urine and blood metals to multi-media bio-
markers and the joint effect can be determined. The weights can then be
used to quantify the contribution of each medium to the multi-media
biomarker. In this supervised learning approach, we used WQS (100
bootstraps) to determine the association between each birth outcome
and urinary and blood biomarkers of each metal, separately. A pre-
liminary analysis was conducted before the construction of WQS models.
As WQS assumes linearity, in an effort to detect potential non-linear
relationships between individual metals and birth outcomes, we used
generalized additive models (GAM) to graphically depict the metal and
birth outcome relationship. Results from GAM including metal concen-
trations as splines and the GAM output graphics showed that when the
smoothing estimator is significant the observed associations are linear
(estimated degree of freedom 1). Therefore, we proceeded with WQS.
All outcomes were regressed on the geometric averages of SG-corrected
urinary and blood concentrations across all the available visits. Then we
combined the weights to generate multi-media biomarkers using equa-
Uon (6).

In epidemiological studies with repeated measurements, the ICC
metric, ranging from O to 1, indicates reliability among multiple mea-
surements of a quantity; when close to O, ICC reflects large variations
between repeated measures, a. k.a. poor ability to distinguish between
individuals with high and low exposure levels; when close to 1, the
repeated measures are close to each other which reflects a good ability to
discriminate between individuals with high and low exposure levels. In
this unsupervised machine learning approach, we utilized the ICCs
calculated from repeated measurements of SG-corrected urinary (up to
three visits) and blood metals (up to two visits) (Ashrap et al., 2020a) as
weighting parameters to construct an integrated MMB separately for
each metal using equations

Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to examine the associ-
ations between four types of metal biomarkers measured and composed
(urinary, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBwQs) and birth outcomes. Separate
models were used for each metal biomarker and outcome (e.g., Mn:
MMB1cc and gestational age). As both MMBs described above are
composed using the geometric mean of SG-corrected urinary and blood
metal concentrations, geometric average concentrations across all the
available visits were also used for individual urinary and blood models
in this single-pollutant analysis. Geometric mean of urinary, blood and
MMB biomarker concentrations were split in to tertiles (risk stratifica-
tion purposes). The full models included the tertiles of metal biomarker
concentrations and a final set of covariates that were selected based on a
priori knowledge and whether their inclusion appreciably changed the
effect estimates of metal exposure (Ashrap et al., 2020b). These cova-
riates were maternal age, maternal education level, pre-pregnancy BMI,
and exposure to second-hand smoking. Effect estimates and 95% con-
fidence intervals were calculated for the highest versus the lowest

tertiles of exposure to measure the risk stratification properties of in-
dividual metals and compare them to the collective effects of metal
mixtures as described below.
2.4.3. Mixture analysis
2.4.3.1. Construction of environmental risk scores (ERSs) using ridge
regression. Environmental Risk Score (ERS) was proposed as a potential
summary measure for the effects of mixtures in epidemiologic research
(Park et al., 2014
). The concept of ERS is to build a predictive risk model
as a weighted sum of the exposure levels from simultaneous assessment
of the all the pollutants in the mixture. Weights are determined by the
magnitudes (standardized regression coefficients) of the association
between each exposure and the outcome of interest (
Park et al., 2014)
We constructed Environmental Risk Scores (ERSs) as weighted summary
measures of the effects of metals where the weights were regression
coefficients derived from models of the association between metal
mixtures and the outcome of interest. We utilized Ridge regression to
guide the weight of each metal in relation to preterm birth. Ridge
regression is a regularized regression technique, and it is one of the
commonly used supervised machine learning solutions (
Hoerl and
). Ridge is used to constrain the size of the estimated
Kennard, 1970
coefficients, and the objective function for a continuous outcome can be

package in R (Robin et al., 2011)). For binary outcome models with ERS
tertiles, we also computed the odds ratio (OR) for the highest tertile
versus the lowest tertile to measure the risk stratification properties of
ERS.
3. Results
3.1. Descriptive analysis
Demographic characteristics of the 847 women in this analysis are
summarized in
and were described previously (Ashrap et al.,
Table 1
2018; Aker et al., 2019b
). Mothers included in our analysis had similar
demographic characteristics to the overall PROTECT population (Fer
guson et al., 2019b). Briefly, the cohort included women in their late 20s
(median 27 years) and half of them had a BMI less than 25 kg/m2 prior
to pregnancy. The majority of women (57%) had private medical

riates for the ith subject, and Yi is the continuous health outcome for the
ith subject. Ridge regression utilizes the regularization penalty param-
eter), (A e [O, 00)) to solve the multicollinearity problem and control the
shrinkage of the L2 penalty. Ridge regression decreases the complexity
of the models and enforces the coefficients to be lower without forcing
them to be zero (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970; Tibshirani, 1996
The in-
dividual associations are not constrained to be in the same direction in
Ridge regression. Therefore, Ridge regression was ideal in this setting as
our analytic purpose was to evaluate the same full set of metals as
mixtures across different media and integrated biomarkers that have
different directions of individual metal-birth outcome associations.
Using Ridge regression with an underlying model including biomarkers
of 10 metals and covariates, we performed 10-fold cross-validation and
selected the value that minimized the cross-validated sum of squared
residuals (
Park et al., 2014, 2017
). Four separate ERSs for metals in
urine, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBwQs were computed as a weighted sum
of the 10 metal concentrations (C):

2.4.3.2. ERS models and evaluations. In order to assess risk stratification
power of the different ERSs, we further categorized ERS by its tertiles.
We then refit the regression models with both continuous and categor-
ical ERSs to examine its associations with preterm birth as well as the
auxiliary birth outcomes. We conceptualized the ERSs as a weighted sum
of metal exposure measured in urine, blood, and multi-media bio-
markers composed by WQS and ICC methods, namely, ERSurine, ERS-
blood, ERSMMB_wQs, and ERSMMB_Icc. ROC (Receiver Operating
Characteristics) curves were used to evaluate the preterm, spontaneous
preterm birth, SGA, and LGA classification model performances of four
ERSs. Specifically, the area under curve (AUC) of ROC were computed
for quantifying and visualizing the biomarkers' classification accuracy
for the above-mentioned binary outcomes. We used a bootstrap resam-
pling (2000 iterations) to compute 95% confidence intervals of AUCs for
different models (Carpenter and Bithell, 2000) and to test the difference
between AUCs (the ci. auc() and roc. test() functions in the PROC
847).

3.1.1. MMB composition
The weights of urinary and blood metals in the composition of MMBs
from ICC and WQS approaches are depicted in
Fig. 2. As the ICC
approach is based on an unsupervised learning method, the metal
biomarker weights are the same across the birth outcomes. In contrast,
the WQS approach is a supervised learning method, therefore, the
weights constructed for each of the metal biomarkers were different for
the respective birth outcomes. The corresponding urinary and blood
weights (WQS) for each birth outcome are presented in Supplementary

contributor to the MMBs from both ICC and WQS approaches. The blood
weights for those metals were higher from the WQS approach than the
ICC approach, except for Mn and Pb where the blood weights were
higher from the ICC approach (60% and 88%) than the WQS approach
(56% and 72%). In contrast, MMB for As was mostly attributed to urine
from the WQS approach (95%).
3.1.2. ERSs
ERS weights derived from Ridge models regressing preterm and
spontaneous preterm birth on metal mixtures are shown in
Fig. 3. The
values of the weights for all the outcomes are provided in Supplemen-
tary Table 3. The largest contributors to preterm birth ERS from urine
mixture were Cd (—0.01), Ni (—0.008), and As (—0.006). For preterm
birth ERSs constructed from the blood, MMB1cc, and MMBvvQs mixtures,
Pb and Mn were the largest positive weight contributors for all three. A
similar weight distribution was observed for spontaneous preterm birth.
The preterm birth ERSs from each biomarker mixture were normally
distributed and ranged from —0.06 to 0.04 for urine; —0.13 to 0.88 for
blood; -0.001 to 0.11 for MMBIcc; and 0.08 to 0.48 for MMBwQs. For
preterm birth ERSs, pairwise correlations among urine ERS and other
ERSs were weak (r < 0.2), whereas blood ERS had relatively higher
correlations with the ERSs for MMB1cc (r — 0.88) and MMBwQs (r —
0.53). The weight distribution for spontaneous preterm birth ERSs were
similar to overall preterm birth ERS weights.

Changes in auxiliary birth outcomes associated with ERSs are shown in
Supplementary Table 4. When spontaneous preterm birth is regressed on
the four ERSs, odds ratios were generally higher compared to the overall
preterm birth models, ranging from 2.34 (95% CI: 1.53, 3.56) to 2.56
(95% CI: 1.58, 4.14). For fetal growth outcomes, all ERSs were signifi-
cantly associated with lower birthweight z-scores; the associations be-
tween ERSs and SGA were stronger (OR: 1.54 to 1.99) than the
associations between ERSs and LGA (OR: 1.32 to 1.53) (Supplementary

indicating that urine, blood, and two MMB ERSs had comparable pre-
dictive performance in these models. Predictive performances of ERS on
other binary outcomes followed similar patterns; performances of urine,
blood, and MMB biomarkers were comparable, with AUC ranging from
0.66 to 0.69 for spontaneous preterm birth, from 0.60 to 0.65 for SGA,
and from 0.60 to 0.62 for LGA.
In an additional analysis, to illustrate the difference in the urine
biomarker performance between disregarding versus accounting for
urine dilution, we reported the odds ratio associated with both uncor-
rected and SG-corrected urine ERSs. Therefore, the performance was
compared between metal mixtures measured in uncorrected urine, SG-
corrected urine, blood, MMB1cc, and MMBwQs. The results are pre-
sented in Supplementary Table 4

was no significant association between uncorrected urine ERS and pre-
term birth, and the odds ratios for other ERS associations were greater
than the odds ratio for the uncorrected urine metal ERS. The p values in
Supplementary Figure 1 represent the significance of the test results for
comparing the predictive performances (preterm birth) of different ERSs
using AUC. The uncorrected urine ERS showed lower prediction per-
formance than SG-corrected urine (p — 0.04), blood ERS (p — 0.02),
MMBIcc ERS (p — 0.003), and MMBwQs ERS (p 0.07). This indicates
that the area under the uncorrected urine ERS curve (AUC — 0.61; 95%
CI 0.54—0.68) is significantly smaller than the other AUCs shown in
Fig. 5: SG-corrected urine ERS (AUC 0.64; 950/6C1 0.58-0.71), the
blood ERS (AUC — 0.68; 95%C1 0.62-0.74), MMBIcc ERS (AUC
0.61-0.73), and MMBwQs (AUC — 0.68; 95%C1
0.67; 95%C1 —
0.62-0.74).
Because Pb was the most important contributor of preterm birth
blood ERS as well as the two MMB ERSs, we conducted another addi-
tional analysis excluding Pb from Ridge models while constructing and
evaluating the performance of the ERSs. The effect estimates from this
analysis for all four (urine, blood, MMB1cc, MMBwQs) ERS were atten-
uated compared to the primary analyses (Supplementary Table 5)
Continuous blood ERS was no longer significantly associated with pre-
term birth (OR/IQR 1.03, 95% Cl 0.77 to 1.37, p — 0.83). The effect
estimates for urine ERS was 1.73 (95% Cl 1.22 to 2.43, p — 0.002),
MMBIcc was 1.83 (95% Cl 1.23 to 2.54, p < 0.001), and was

metal exposure. From a risk stratification perspective, integration of
urine and blood biomarkers that were derived from both ICC and WQS
approaches improved the model performance in the mixture models
compared to the sole urine or blood biomarker models. Although the
confidence intervals for these odds ratio estimates were wider, the MMB
integration, especially using the WQS approach, resulted in substantially
higher effect estimate. This finding supports that while multiple mea-
surements of the exposure mixture may measure metal body burden
differentially, there may still be room for improvement for exposure
measurement error structure and effect estimate when incorporating
urinary and blood biomarker information.
4.1. Strengths and limitations
Specific strengths of our study include its longitudinal design in
which repeated urinary and blood biomarkers provided more accurate
exposure information during pregnancy. This allowed us to quantify the
temporal reliability of the two media measurements (ICCs), which were
further used as weights to integrate the multi-media measure of expo-
sure. Secondly, this study utilized data-driven machine learning ap-
proaches to 1) inform the composition of multi-media metal biomarkers
measured in different media and 2) guide the construction of environ-
mental risk scores for each medium reflecting the overall exposure to the
metal mixture. Finally, this study evaluated the health effects of multiple
metals simultaneously and compared the performance of different
media biomarkers and integrated biomarkers in relation to adverse birth
outcomes in the context of a mixture. The results lay the groundwork for
future epidemiological studies on biomarker selection when examining
the mixture effects of metals.
However, our study has several limitations. The relatively small
sample size did not allow cross-validation within this population on ERS,
which may have caused overfitting of ERS. Future studies with a larger
sample size should implement training and test datasets to cross-validate
ERSs. Studies with larger sample sizes are also needed to address po-
tential improvement of models by including non-linear terms and in-
teractions between metals and covariates that were not accounted for in
the current analysis. Depending on the pharmacokinetics of each
chemical within a family, mixture studies, in general, are challenged by
the complications of combining chemical biomarkers where each may
be representing a unique window of exposure. While our ERS estimates
also suffered from this limitation, by combining multi-media exposure
using both urine and blood biomarkers, we were able to reduce the
measurement error in the mixture analysis to an extent. Because the
average concentrations of metal biomarkers across three visits were used
in this analysis, windows of vulnerability during pregnancy were not
evaluated. Given that associations between metal mixtures and birth
outcomes may depend on developmental time windows, it is important
for future longitudinal studies to evaluate the temporality of the asso-
ciations. In addition, while we evaluated a mixture of 10 essential and
non-essential metals, it is possible that other metals that were not
assessed in our study affect the performance of urine or blood bio-
markers. Future work is needed to expand the mixture evaluation to
include more metals and other biospecimens including hair and saliva,
as well as other adverse health outcomes because our results may not be
generalizable to other outcomes of interest. Finally, while the mixture of
metals in this study is representative of exposures experienced by Puerto
Rican populations, it may not accurately reflect exposure profiles for
other populations.
5. Conclusions
Our study used innovative methodology to provide new detailed
insights into the individual and integrated associations of urinary and
blood mixture biomarkers of metal exposure with birth outcomes. Our
investigation demonstrates, within practical metal analytical panels,
that measuring metals in either urine or blood may be an equally good
Environmental Research 200 (2021) 111435
approach to evaluate the metals as a mixture. The results of our study
elucidate the importance of considering the overall mixture perfor-
mance of a certain medium. Future studies are needed to expand to
evaluate the performance with different metal panels, media, health
outcomes of interest, and methods to integrate exposure information, to
further address how to most effectively study the health impacts of
exposure to mixtures.

ABSTRACT
Purpose: We examined prospective associations between early childcare precarity, or the security and reliability of
childcare arrangements, and subsequent maternal health.
Study Design: We conducted a secondary analysis of survey responses from mothers of 2,836 children in the Future of
Families and Child Wellbeing study. We assessed the following childcare measures: insecure childcare, insecure
childcare with missed work, inadequate childcare, and emergency childcare support. We used linear and logistic
regression models with robust standard errors to examine associations between these measures when the index child
was age 3 and maternal health outcomes (overall health, depression, and parenting stress) later when the child was age
9. We then examined additive experiences of childcare measures across child ages 1 and 3 on maternal health outcomes.
Results: Early inadequate childcare increased odds of later poor maternal overall health (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.64;
95% confidence interval [Cll, 1.11-2.41). All early childcare precarity measures increased odds of maternal depression
(insecure childcare [aOR, 1.64; 95% Cl, 1.23-2.18]; insecure childcare with missed work [aOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13—2.22]; and
inadequate childcare [aOR, 1.75; 95% Cl, 1.22—2.511). Emergency childcare support decreased the odds of adverse
maternal health outcomes (poor overall health [aOR, 0.65; 95% Cl, 0.48 to 0.88]; depression [aOR, 0.73; 95% Cl, 0.54 to
0.99]; and parenting stress [B —0.45; 95% Cl, —0.80 to —0.10]). Prolonged experiences had stronger associations with
maternal health than shorter experiences.
Conclusion: Early childcare precarity has long-term adverse associations with maternal health, and emergency childcare
support seems to be favorable for maternal health. These findings highlight childcare precarity as a social determinant of
women's health for researchers, clinicians, and decision-makers.

Childcare precarity is a state of insecure and unreliable
childcare arrangements while parents are working or in school.
Among other hardships faced by families with young children,
childcare precarity is unique, because it interferes directly with
an adult parent's ability to work or attend school, which can lead
to work-family conflict, long-term income instability, and
decreased economic opportunities, particularly for those who
identify as mothers (Geyer, Haan, & Wrohlich, 2015, Grice et al.,
2011; Luhr, Schneider, & Harknett, 2022; Müller & Wrohlich,
). Studies show that women assume the majority of child-
2020
care responsibilities (Petts, Carlson, & Pepin, 2021). Thus, expe-
riences of childcare precarity may take a particular toll on
women's health when persistent childcare-related disruptions to
work or school routines upset important daily routines,

eventually leading to poor physical and/or mental health out-
comes. For example, unstable employment schedules have been
associated with lower maternal sleep quality and happiness
(Harknett, Schneider, & Irwin, 2021 ); income instability is known
to worsen physical and/or mental health (Crear-Perry et al.,
2021). Childcare instability—or unstable, fluctuating childcare
arrangements—is understood as an important child health issue,
with key associations with adverse behavioral health outcomes,
poor social adjustment, and child maltreatment risk (Bratsch-
Hines, Mokrova, & Vernon-Feagans, 2015; Ha, Collins, &
Martino, 2015, Pilarz & Hill, 2014
). Understanding the potential
health consequences of the closely adjoining maternal experi-
ence of childcare precarity or, conversely, maternal access to
emergency childcare support from family or friends, would
inform strategies to improve women's health and well-being.
As reflected in ongoing policy debates about parental leave
Goodman, Williams, & Dow, 2021) and universal access to pre-
kindergarten education (Reid et al., 2019), childcare needs are
greatest before school entry at age 5. Problems with childcare
arrangements in the preschool years—after infancy but before
school entry—have been associated with immediate psycho-
logical strain, parenting stress, and depressive symptoms, which
may be causal or explained by other family instability variables
during this period of transitional parenthood when those who
identify as mothers may experience conflict from competing
responsibilities (Charrois et al., 2017; Johnson & Padilla, 2019,
Nærde et al., 2000; Pilarz & Hill, 2017). Whether or not childcare
experiences have lasting associations with maternal health even
after the peak period of childcare needs has passed—for
example, when children are in school—is poorly understood.
Furthermore, existing research does not report whether the kind
of dose—response association that exists for other hardships (e.g.,
the severity of food insecurity corresponds with the severity of
negative health outcomes) also exists for childcare precarity
(Gross, Mendelsohn, & Messito, 2018; Reid, 2000)
To address these gaps, we use data from a national birth
cohort recruited from large cities to investigate prospective as-
sociations between early maternal childcare experiences (inse-
cure childcare, insecure childcare with missed work, inadequate
childcare, availability of emergency childcare) before school en-
try when children were age 3 and later maternal health out-
comes when children were age 9 (overall health status,
depression, and parenting stress). We hypothesized that 1)
increased childcare precarity risk is adversely associated with
later maternal health outcomes, 2) access to emergency child-
care support is positively associated with maternal health out-
comes, and 3) prolonged experiences of childcare precarity are
more strongly associated with long-term maternal health out-
comes than shorter experiences.
Methods
Study Design
This was a secondary analysis of data from the Future of
Families and Child Wellbeing (FFCWB) study, an ongoing na-
tional birth cohort study from 20 large U.S. cities (1998-2000)
(Reichman et al., 2001 ). Leveraging a longitudinal cohort dataset
as has been done with similar research questions (Anyigbo,
Jimenez, & Sosnowski, 2022; Dauner, Wilmot, & Schultz, 2015),
we account for temporal ordering by measuring childcare pre-
carity at a developmentally appropriate earlier time point before
subsequent maternal health outcomes of interest. Specifically, to
test the hypothesis of whether childcare precarity experiences
when children were age 3 have associations with maternal
health outcomes when children are age 9 (a lag of approximately
6 years), we estimated regression models with conservative
robust standard errors. In these models, we adjusted for relevant
covariates selected using a comprehensive directed acyclic graph
informed by important baseline covariates related to the FFCWB
sampling design as well as a careful review of childcare studies
Gordon, Kaestner, & Korenman, 2008; Johnson & Padilla, 2019;
Pilarz & Hill, 2014, 2017, Reichman et al., 2001 ).
Participants
The FFCWB study oversampled nonmarital births (3: 1), a
population at increased risk to be at a lower socioeconomic
status and with decreased access to social support (Liang, Berger,
& Brand, 2019; Solomon-Fears, 2014). The original cohort study
included 4,898 children largely from socioeconomically disad-
vantaged groups. Study staff interviewed parents shortly after
giving birth (baseline), then re-interviewed parents when chil-
dren were 1, 3, and 9 years old. Our secondary analysis included
self-identified mothers who were primary caregivers for the
focal child with complete longitudinal data for our variables
(n 2,836) (
Figure 1), and we confirmed that baseline charac-
teristics of our sample were similar to the full FFCWB sample
(Reichman et al., 2001). The Institutional Review Board at NYU
Grossman School of Medicine deemed this study exempt from
human subjects review because it was an analysis of publicly
available deidentified data.
Measures
Childcare Precarity Measures When the Child Was Age 3
To conceptualize our main predictor, we first referenced prior
work examining childcare instability, which describes child
health outcomes associated with unstable, fluctuating, or mul-
tiple childcare arrangements. Our interest was in capturing the
adjoining, but distinct, maternal experience of childcare pre-
carity, or feelings of uncertainty, lack of predictability, and
insecurity, a concept informed by an interdisciplinary review of
literature describing similar experiences of job and economic
precarity (
Luhr et al., 2022; North, 2021; Parolin & Lee, 2022) We
used three assessments of childcare precarity with increasing
severity, measured when children were at age 3. These questions
were only asked of parents of children in regular childcare,
defined in the FFCWB study as being cared for by someone other
than a mother or father on a regular basis for 10 or more hours a
week.
Insecure childcare. This question captures childcare that fell
through, leaving the participant to scramble for backup childcare
arrangements. The survey asked, "Approximately how many
times in the past month did you have to make special arrange-
ments because your usual childcare arrangement fell through?"
Participants who reported this experience at least once were
coded as having insecure childcare. The FFCWB did not collect
information on the circumstances for which childcare fell
through, such as a parent's subjective decision to keep a child
home owing to
unreliability.

participant missing a day of work or training. The survey asked,
"How many times in the past month did you miss work or school
because your childcare arrangement fell through?" Participants
who reported this experience at least once were coded as having
insecure childcare with missed work.
Inadequate childcare. This question captures the highest level of
childcare severity, assessing whether or not childcare precarity
resulted in interruption or suspension of the participant's pro-
fessional trajectory. The survey asked participants whether since
their child was age 1, "Have you had to quit a job, school, or
training activity because you had problems arranging childcare
or keeping a childcare arrangement?" Participants who respon-
ded yes were coded as having had inadequate childcare.
Access to Emergency Childcare Support When the Child Was
3 Years Old
To assess emergency childcare support, we used a question
that captures access to emergency childcare support from
informal sources: "If you needed help during the next year, could
you count on someone to help you with emergency child care?"
If the participant replied yes, they were coded as having emer-
gency childcare support. This question, asked of all participants
regardless of whether the child was in childcare, is part of a
larger question set in the FFCWB measuring perceived social
support (e.g., someone to count on for a $200 loan), which has
been consistently associated with positive health outcomes
(Dauner et al., 2015; Delaney, 2017)
Reliable childcare is most relevant for parents who are
working or in school, but emergency childcare support has been
shown to be a key component of a "parental safety net" (Harknett
& Knab, 2007 , Harknett & Hartnett, 2011 ). Thus, when examining
associations with maternal health outcomes when children were
age 9, we assessed emergency childcare support in all families, as
well as in a subset of participants who ever worked when their
children were ages 1, 3, or 5. Given that access to emergency
childcare support could mitigate childcare precarity, we also
explored whether emergency childcare support had a buffering
interaction with childcare precarity (i.e., whether it reduced the
magnitude of association between childcare precarity and
maternal health).
Maternal Health Measures When the Child Was Age 9
Poor/Fair Overall Maternal Health
This measure captures self-reported health, which studies
have established to be a valid health status indicator for adult
population health monitoring to reflect physical health, health
care use, and mortality (McGee et al., 1999; Miilunpalo et al.,
). The survey asked "In general, how is your health?" Par-
1997
ticipants could respond 1) excellent, 2) very good, 3) good, 4) fair,
or 5) poor. Per prior work (McGee et al., 1999; Miilunpalo et al.,
), we dichotomized overall health at the cutpoint of poor/
1997
fair versus all others and ran sensitivity analyses using a cutpoint
of excellent versus all others. This same measure was also
assessed in participants when children were age 1, which we
used as a covariate in certain models.
Maternal Depression
Maternal depression was derived from the Composite Inter-
national Diagnostic Interview, a comprehensive, fully structured
interview assessing International Classification of Diseases, 10th
edition, and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
IVth edition, mental health criteria administered by trained in-
terviewers (Kessler et al., 1998). The FFCWB uses the short form,
which includes 15 Composite International Diagnostic Interview
questions about the prior 12 months. Examples of symptoms
surveyed include losing interest, weight changes, trouble
sleeping or concentrating, feeling worthless, and thinking about
death. The FFCWB user guide (Fragile families and child wellbeing
study, n.d.) recommends two scoring methods based on symp-
tom duration. For our main analyses, we used the "liberal"
scoring, which is more sensitive for depression (16.5% score
positive for depression with this scoring), and we conducted
sensitivity analyses using "conservative" scoring, which is more
specific (11.6% score positive for depression with this scoring)
Fragile families and child wellbeing study, n.d.
Maternal
depression was also assessed when children were age 1, and we
used the short form scoring as a covariate in certain models.
Maternal Parenting Stress
This measure captures stress triggered by child-rearing tasks.
FFCWB used questions derived from the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics and the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training
Program Survey (McGonagle et al., 2012). Participants responded
on a 4-point Likert scale (e.g., "not at all true," "completely true")
to statements such as "Being a parent is harder than I thought it
would be" or "I feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent." In
line with prior work, we reverse coded the items and summed
the items so that higher scores represented higher levels of
agreement with parenting stress statements (Cooper et al., 2009,
). We ran sensitivity analyses using the alter-
Lin & Wiley, 2017
nate parenting stress scoring method, which averages the scores
from each statement (Fragile families and child wellbeing study,
n.d.). In certain models, we additionally adjusted for parenting

stress when children were age 1, which was assessed with the
same measure but not collected for two of the FFCWB cities at
that time point.
Covariates
We tested all factors for multicollinearity by assessing vari-
ance inflation factors before inclusion in our model. Maternal
baseline characteristics, measured at birth, included maternal
age (years), race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic Black, Hispanic, other), education level (less than high
school, high school graduate, some college, college graduate),
family structure (married, cohabiting, parents in a relationship
but not cohabiting, no relationship), and income as a percentage
of the federal poverty level (0—49%, 50-99%, 100—199%, 200—
299%, 300% or higher). Child baseline characteristics included
assigned sex at birth, first born, and multiple birth status.
Covariates at other timepoints included whether participants
ever worked or were in school when their children were age 3 or
before age 1 (yes/no). Prior work has also shown that the use of
childcare centers over individual caregivers led to work absences
owing to child illnesses, so we adjusted for childcare center use
as well the number of childcare arrangements concurrently used
when their children were at age 3 to proxy for childcare insta-
bility (
Gordon et al., 2008).
As per prior relevant research, we controlled for child
temperament at age 1 using the mean of the Emotionality, Ac-
tivity, and Sociability Temperament Survey (
Pilarz & Hill, 2014),
with higher scores indicating negative emotionality and shyness.
This covariate helped to account for child-level time-invariant
differences that may contribute to both childcare precarity ex-
periences and maternal health.
Finally, as has been done in prior work (Hedges et al., 2021
we ran an additional model that adjusted for the corresponding
maternal health outcome measure when their children were age
1, before age 3 childcare exposures, to account for time-invariant
maternal health characteristics at baseline, in an effort to isolate
our estimates to what occurred when their children were be-
tween ages 3 and 9 only.
Statistical Analysis
We used Stata/SE version 15 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX)
to conduct all analyses. To preserve sample size, we did not use
FFCWB weights so that we could include all families with com-
plete longitudinal data.
We first summarized child, maternal, and childcare charac-
teristics. Using unadjusted or independent sample t-tests as
appropriate, we tested for statistically significant differences
between the sample in and not in regular childcare. For our
primary study question, we used logistic and linear regressions
as appropriate to estimate adjusted regression models of asso-
ciations between childcare precarity when children were age 3
and maternal health outcomes when children were age 9. Model
1 controlled for maternal, child, and childcare characteristics.
Model 2 added the corresponding maternal health outcome
measure when children were age 1, before age 3 childcare ex-
posures. We used robust standard errors to account conserva-
tively for potential bias in estimates. We presented estimates as
odds ratios (ORS) or unstandardized linear regression co-
efficients (Bs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIS).
To characterize persistent childcare precarity or support across
child ages 1 and 3, we categorized the variables as never (no at
both ages 1 and 3; the reference group), age 1 only (yes at age 1, no
at age 3), age 3 only (no at age 1, yes at age 3), and both time points
(yes at both ages 1 and 3), and estimated adjusted logistic and
linear regression models to examine associations between
persistent early childcare precarity or emergency childcare sup-
port and maternal health outcomes when children were age 9. We
ran these analyses using covariates from model 1 to maximizes
cases given that the corresponding parenting stress variable was
not measured in all cities when children were age 1, and we ran
sensitivity analyses using covariates from model 2.
To assess cross-sectional relationships when children were
age 3, we conducted supplemental analyses examining associa-
tions between childcare measures and maternal health out-
comes both measured when children were age 3. We also
examined associations between childcare measures when chil-
dren were age 1 and maternal health outcomes when children
were age 9. Supplemental analyses used model 2 covariates.
Results
The overall sample included 2,836 participants; of those,
1,716 participants (60.5%) had children in regular childcare
(Table 1). The majority of the sample had a minoritized back-
ground; almost one-half (49.5%) self-identified as Black, almost
one-quarter (24.4%) as Hispanic, and less than one-quarter
(22.5%) as white. There were subgroup differences across socio-
demographics between those whose children were in and not in
regular childcare. Participants with children in regular childcare
were more likely to be Black (53.3% vs. 43.8), less likely to be
Hispanic (21.2% vs. 29.3), and more likely to have higher levels of
education and income. This group was also more likely to not live
with a partner (i.e., less likely to be married [24.1% vs. 29.0%], less
likely to be cohabiting [33.5% vs. 38.5%]).
In the subsample of those with children in childcare, more
than one-quarter (27.9%) had insecure childcare, 15.3% had
insecure childcare with missed work, and 11.8% had inadequate
childcare. Those with children in regular childcare were more
likely to report access to emergency childcare support than those
whose children were not in regular childcare (91.3% vs. 86.0%).
Early Childcare Precarity and Subsequent Maternal Health
Participants with early inadequate childcare when their
children were age 3, the highest level of childcare precarity, had
increased odds of poor/fair overall health when children were
age 9 compared with participants without early inadequate
childcare even when adjusting for poor/fair overall health when
children were age 1 (model 2: aOR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.11—2.41). The
other two, less severe, childcare precarity measures were not
significantly associated with increased odds of poor/fair overall
health (
Table 2)
All early childcare precarity measures were associated with
increased odds of maternal depression (model 2: insecure
childcare [aOR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.23—2.181; insecure childcare with
missed work [aOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-2.22]; and inadequate
childcare [a0R, 1.75; 95% Cl, 1.22-2.51]).
Early insecure childcare was associated with greater
parenting stress scores later on when controlling for maternal
and child characteristics (model 1: B +0.29 score; 95% CI, 0.01—
0.58), but not when controlling for prior levels of parenting
stress when children were age 1 (model 2: B +0.12 score; 95% CI,
—0.16 to 0.40). Early inadequate childcare, the highest level of
childcare precarity, was again associated with greater parenting

precarity did not yield meaningfully significant findings (data
not shown).
Additive Experiences When Children Were Ages 1 and 3 and
Subsequent Maternal Health
Across our three childcare precarity variables, persistent
exposure when children were both ages 1 and 3 approximately
tripled the odds of depression compared with no childcare pre-
carity at either time point (model 1: insecure childcare laOR,
2.82; 95% Cl, 1.65—4.84]; insecure childcare with missed work
[aOR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.73-7.39]; and inadequate childcare laOR,
3.54; 95% CI, 1.86—6.721). We found no additive associations be-
tween childcare precarity and poor/fair overall health or
parenting stress (Table 3).
Persistent access to emergency childcare support when chil-
dren were both ages 1 and 3 halved the odds of having poor/fair
overall health (model 1: aOR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.74) and
decreased parenting stress (model 1: B
-0.75 score; 95% Cl,
— 1.29 to —0.20) compared with not having emergency childcare
support at either time point. We found no additive protective
associations between emergency childcare support and maternal
depression.
Supplemental and Sensitivity Analyses
Supplemental Table 1
displays concurrent associations be-
tween experiences of childcare precarity and maternal health
outcomes when children were age 3. In comparison with our
main findings in
where we did not detect strong asso-
Table 2,
ciations with parenting stress, some childcare precarity mea-
sures were associated with increased parenting stress scores
concurrently, even when adjusting for parenting stress scores
when children were age 1. Supplemental Table 2 displays similar
or diminished relationships between childcare measures when
children were age 1 and maternal health outcomes when chil-
dren were age 9. The only statistically significant association was
between inadequate childcare when children were age 1 and
maternal depression when children were age 9.
Sensitivity analyses using alternate cutoffs for maternal
overall health (excellent vs. all others), depression (using the
conservative cutoff), parenting stress (alternate scoring method),
and additive effects (using model 2 covariates with decreased
power) all yielded findings that supported the interpretations of
our main results (data not shown).
Discussion
In a national U.S. birth cohort from large cities, we found
significant and robust associations between early childcare pre-
carity and maternal health outcomes approximately 6 years later,
which have not been described before. These findings suggest
that policies to increase access to reliable, secure childcare and
emergency childcare supports could improve the health of
mothers of young children. We categorized levels of childcare
precarity (i.e., insecure, insecure with missed work, inadequate),
as often is done for food insecurity (e.g., food insecure, food
insecure with hunger) (Blumberg et al., 1999). This categoriza-
tion, which acknowledges that families experience varying levels
of hardship, also demonstrates that increased severity may be
associated with poorer health outcomes and indicates that
childcare precarity is a social determinant of women's health.
Our finding that early inadequate childcare was associated
with increased odds of poor/fair maternal health later on extends
literature showing associations between other experiences of
social determinants of health and poorer overall health (e.g., food
insecurity [
Hager et al., 2010; Stuff et al., 20041 and housing
disrepair [Adamkiewicz et al., 2014]). Furthermore, prolonged

access to emergency childcare support had protective and ad-
ditive effects on overall health later on: participants with
emergency childcare support when children were both ages 1
and 3 had one-half the odds of poor/fair health compared with
participants who had no emergency childcare support when
children were either age. To our knowledge, this is one of the first
studies to find associations between childcare experiences with
long-term overall maternal health, and it suggests future studies
should elucidate potential pathways from experiencing childcare
precarity to potentially curtailing work or training, reducing in-
come, increasing stress, and compromising overall women's
health (Chatterji, Markowitz, & Brooks-Gunn, 2013)
All childcare precarity measures we considered were associ-
ated with subsequent maternal depression. Maternal depression
is a common, chronic source of disability that is also likely a
vehicle for the intergenerational transmission of poverty-related
toxic stress (Letourneau et al., 2019; Schor, 2018; Wachs, Black, &
). A prior study found associations between percep-
Engle, 2009
tions of stable childcare access and decreased odds of maternal
depression when children were preschool aged, but not between
an increased number of childcare arrangements and concurrent
maternal depression
(Johnson & Padilla, 2019). Our findings
reinforce that it is the participant's experiences of childcare
precarity rather than the actual arrangement—which may reflect
maternal cultural and personal preferences—that likely
contribute to maternal depression. Our findings also suggest that
the most notable associations with childcare precarity may be
long term in the setting of persistent experiences of managing
conflicts between work and family. Supplemental analyses
showed that experiences of inadequate childcare starting when
children were age 1 were associated with maternal depression
when children were age 9, showing potentially enduring effects
of childcare precarity on maternal mental health. Future studies
should elucidate vulnerable stages of parenthood when systemic
efforts to deliver childcare support may optimize long-term
maternal mental health.
Although depression captures overall feelings of dysphoria or
anhedonia, parenting stress stems specifically from parenting
(e.g., "l feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent"). Although
we found strong associations between early childcare precarity
and later maternal depression, associations with parenting stress
were less consistent. Early insecure and inadequate childcare, but
not insecure childcare with missed work, had associations with
parenting stress scores; none of these estimates were significant
after adjusting for parenting stress at 1 year. Our measure of
parenting stress was not available for two of the FFCWB cities
when children were age 1, which potentially limited our ability to
detect associations in those models. However, this finding is
consistent with prior research showing that associations be-
tween childcare precarity and parenting stress do not hold up
when adjusting for prior stress, perhaps because participants
experiencing stress to begin with are also more likely to expe-
rience childcare precarity (
). In supplemental
Pilarz & Hill, 2017
analyses, we found that all experiences of childcare precarity
were associated with parenting stress concurrently when chil-
dren were age 3, which may indicate that parenting stress may
dissipate over time as concentrated childcare needs decrease.
The ability to follow families more intensely and reevaluate
childcare supports at various stages may yield valuable infor-
mation on the extent of childcare supports needed across
childhood, informing interventions to optimize family health.
We found that emergency childcare support had favorable
associations with all subsequent maternal health outcomes in
the full sample. These findings reinforce an accumulating body of
evidence showing that access to social support is a matter of
public health (
). Participants parenting on their
Balaji et al., 2007
own, who made up the majority of our sample, may also
particularly benefit from robust social support networks. How-
ever, as reflected in the regular childcare sample where associ-
ations were similar in direction and magnitude but no longer
significant, access to emergency childcare may be helpful as a
short-term solution but not an adequate substitute for ongoing
reliable childcare essential for a parent to successfully engage in
employment or training. The sample who ever worked when
children were ages 1, 3, and 5 (the vast majority) did show
benefits from emergency childcare support, suggesting that the
presence of this informal safety net does likely benefit most
participants who are attempting to work or go to school. We did
not detect statistical interaction when exploring whether
emergency childcare support buffered the effects of childcare
precarity. However, future studies should consider intentionally
powering their samples to examine additional subgroup ana-
lyses by income, race, or types of social support specifically as a
strength-based approach.
Limitations include study design, sampling, unmeasured
variable bias, and loss to follow-up. The FFCWB is a prospective
observational study and causality cannot be established. The
FFCWB also oversampled nonmarital births, with the intention of
generating data on an understudied socioeconomically disad-
vantaged population. Yet, childcare precarity likely has health
impacts across socioeconomic strata, as highlighted in parenting
studies during the COVID-19 pandemic (Petts et al., 2021) In
analyses examining childcare experiences across timepoints
when children were ages 1 and 3, a few of the subgroups were
below 50 participants and estimates were less precise with large
CIS. These analyses were likely underpowered to detect associ-
ations for mothers experiencing precarity consistently when
their children were ages 1 and 3. In light of limited U.S. data
available to study long-term outcomes of childcare precarity,
new prospective studies involving larger and more diverse co-
horts are needed. FFCWB also only asks about childcare precarity
for children regularly cared for by someone else at the time of the
survey, omitting participants who may have used regular care in
early childhood, but not at the time of the survey. Although we
were able to examine the effects of emergency childcare support
on all participants, experiences of childcare precarity were only
assessed in participants who had children in regular childcare at
the time. The FFCWB also did not include information on why
childcare fell through, which may depend on subjective parental
judgment (e.g., mild illnesses), rather than provider reliability.
However, our decision to control for childcare type or child
temperament may have tempered this potential bias. Finally, loss
to follow-up is also a limitation, although our overall sample
characteristics are similar to the FFCWB baseline, suggesting
minimal bias owing to attrition.
Implications for Policy and/or Practice
Overall, our study findings leverage a life course framework to
suggest that experiences of early childcare precarity may be
followed by persistent or even mounting adverse maternal
health associations over time. Findings from this study support
primary care efforts to screen for childcare precarity (Chung
et al., 2016; Sokol et al., 2019), as well as integration of
maternal-child health care system linkages to harmonize access
to child and maternal community and health resources (

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective We sought to understand BRCA previvors' perceptions of communication with genetic counselors and other
healthcare providers.
Methods: We conducted 16 qualitative interviews and utilized thematic analysis to develop patterns present in the nar-
ratives of previvors.
Results: Interviews with previvors suggest genetic counselors and other providers often make assumptions about
previvors' family planning and treatrnent needs based on perceived gender, age, and sexual orientation.
Conclusioru• BRCA patients require individualized attention when planning for their future and making healthcare de-
cisions and we argue that implementing patient-centered care practices into the communication process can provide a
higher quality of care.
Innovatioru This study offers an innovative lens through which scholars and healthcare providers may examine the ex-
periences of BRCA previvors as they seek adequate care. Asking previvors to explain their perceptions of conversations
with genetic counselors and healthcare providers offers insight into the communicative process of seeking care rather
than the health outcomes of the care itself. Our findings suggest biases among providers related to gender, age, and
sexual orientation are concerning elements of family planning communication that potentially interrupt previvors'
abilities to express their care needs in a safe environment. We argue for an increased awareness of, and advocacy
for, more inclusive conversations regarding treatrnent and family planning decisions.
Individuals found to carry a pathogenic variant in the genes BRCAI /2,
sometimes referred to as previvors, often meet with numerous healthcare
providers including genetic counselors, gynecologists, and oncologists
throughout their journey. They rely on these and other sources to learn
more about their genetic mutation, family planning and fertility options,
and treatment possibilities, which largely include surveillance and surgery.
Research on communication between genetic counselors and BRCA previvors
is growing, yet still provides opportunities for exploration. A much larger
body of research has explored the communication between genetic coun-
selors and individuals who have received a cancer diagnosis or are receiving
treatments, including a scoping review published in 2019 [1] highlighting
the need to study the communication process in genetic counseling more
deeply. Prior literature suggests genetic counseling tends to focus on biomed-
ical information rather than psychological support of patients [1]. In addition,
patients' needs for personalized information regarding their diagnosis, family
dynamics, and treatment options may not always be met by genetic

counselors [2]. In a study of breast and ovarian cancer patients, Jacobs and
colleagues [2] argued that research is needed to better understand communi-
cation by oncology professionals, including genetic counselors.
We begin to answer this call, and extend agency to previvors, with an
exploratory study investigating BRCA previvors and their experiences
with genetic counselors and other members of their healthcare team.
BRCA previvors, along with most precision medicine patients, have specific
needs when meeting with genetic counselors and other providers. Sharing
previvors' experiences with healthcare providers like genetic counselors,
gynecologists, and oncologists through qualitative interviews such as
those used in this study can help educate scholars, healthcare providers,
genetic counselors and professionals and policymakers on how to improve
engagement with this growing population.

BRCA previvors, including an increased focus on patient-centered care and
communication [2—4]. Patient-centered care is designed to manage the con-
cerns many scholars have noted are central to the previvor experience like
uncertainty, information exchange, emotional well-being, and self-
management [3,5,6]. In a recent article on enhancing patient-centered
care within precision oncology, Chou and her colleagues [7] note commu-
nication is critical for those being genetically tested for hereditary breast
and ovarian cancer. Such patients are often struggling with feelings of un-
certainty [8—10] in understanding their diagnosis and in making decisions
based on their results. Genetic counselors and other providers can help pa-
tients manage their uncertainty by addressing their specific care prefer-
ences as well as concerns like financial insecurity, misinformation, and
the possibility of changing treatment modalities when necessary [7,8].
There are documented psychological impacts of genetic testing for BRCA
patients [11—13] and patient-centered care and communication is critical
to ensure previvors' needs are met.
In a qualitative study of BRCA previvors' experiences with genetic test-
ing and treatment planning, Hesse-Biber [5] found previvors did not make
decisions specifically based on statistical data provided by their genetic
counselor. Instead, they filtered those data through a broader lens of per-
sonal experiences and preferences. Genetic counselors must understand
those personal preferences to offer the highest quality of care for previvors.
Patient-centered care within precision medicine and genetic testing, as de-
scribed by Arora and colleagues [4] needs to take a whole-person approach
rather than focusing on the patient's genes alone.
While important, most prior scholarship has analyzed quantitative com-
munication outcomes such as patients' uncertainty, anxiety, and stress after
communicating with counselors, rather than the communication process it-
self [1]. Qualitative studies are needed to analyze perceptions of the process
of communication in visits between BRCA previvors, genetic counselors,
and other providers on their healthcare teams to ensure the highest quality
care throughout the previvor journey that is meeting the needs of previvors.
1.2. Family planning for BRCA previvors
Precision medicine and genetic testing for BRCA previvors has many
benefits but requires strong communication between patients and providers
particularly around patients' personal and family planning needs [8]. Fam-
ily planning is the act of deciding how many children to have and how to
space out pregnancy, keeping in mind fertility issues, contraception, prena-
tal testing, and other health concerns. Family planning is a central topic
within genetic counseling sessions for BRCA patients as decisions about
managing cancer risk (i.e., prophylactic oophorectomy) might also impact
reproductive decisions [14, 15]. However, family planning communication
scholarship is still quite limited with regards to navigating the individual
preferences of patients. Most literature notes the importance of family plan-
ning as well as the struggle many go through in the process of making deci-
sions regarding their reproductive health [9,15,16], but research detailing
the process of how patients and genetic counselors communicate about
family planning is scarce.
There is often an assumption that BRCA previvors want to get married,
have kids, and plan for a family once diagnosed. However, a recent study of
single, unmarried Korean BRCA mutation carriers found that 25.3% of
those surveyed no longer wanted to get married and 36.2% who previously
wanted to bear children no longer want them [17]. Family planning schol-
arship is often presented through a normative, cisgender and heterosexual
lens, leaving out others experiencing previvorship. Additionally, there is
minimal research on how the age of BRCA previvors impacts their family
planning and treatment choices [15,17]. These previvors may not interact
with genetic counselors in the same way as others and research is needed
to detail the experiences of those patients so counselors and other
healthcare providers understand the specific needs of all patients.
Therefore, this study asks:

counselors and other healthcare providers about their diagnosis and
treatment plan?
PEC Innovation 2 (2023) 100157
RQ2: What were previvors' perceptions of communication with providers
and experiences within the healthcare system related to family planning?
2. Method
2.1. Study design
To examine BRCA previvors' experiences with genetic counselors and
other healthcare professionals throughout their process of diagnosis, sur-
gery, and recovery, we used an exploratory, qualitative interview approach.
The data were collected as part of a larger study that examined reasons for
social media content creation by previvors [3] although these data were not
previously analyzed. The Institutional Review Board approved the study
protocol (IRB_OOI 44720).
2.2. Recruitment and eligibility
This study recruited individuals living in the United States who have
been found to carry a BRCAI or BRCA2 mutation and identify as woman
with the pronouns she/her or a non-binary person with the pronouns
they/them. Of the total participants (n = 16), 15 were women and one
was non-binary. However, the non-binary individual noted that they are
often perceived as female and have "woman" listed as their gender on
their medical paperwork for insurance purposes. All participants were
white presenting, but two identified as Hispanic and two identified as Ash-
kenazi Jewish, noting the importance of their ethnicity as related to their
BRCA status, as one in 40 Ashkenazi Jewish women have a BRCA mutation
[18]. All individuals had to be over the age of 18 and could participate re-
gardless of where they were in their BRCA journey. Additionally, all partic-
ipants must have been active on at least one personal social media account
where they shared about their experiences publicly.
Individuals were recruited through both Instagram and TikTok. The
principal investigator searched popular hashtags related to BRCA includ-
ing: #brca, #brcal, #previvor, #brcagene, and #breastcancerprevivor.
Once accounts populated, the researcher reached out to previvors who
listed their email addresses publicly on their social media accounts
explaining the project and requesting they respond if interested. Once indi-
viduals responded, they were scheduled for interviews and provided with
the consent form.
2.3. Procedure
Eligible participants were scheduled for a virtual interview over Zoom.
Verbal consent was requested again at the start of each interview before re-
cording was initiated. All interview audio was recorded for accuracy and
transparency for the duration of the interview. The interviews were based
on a semi-structured interview format and topics included the previvor's ex-
perience with BRCA up until the day of the interview, their experience
working with genetic counselors and healthcare providers through their
journey, their activity on social media, and how they feel about the online
communities surrounding BRCA. Each of the interviews lasted between 45
and 60 min and sessions were transcribed verbatim by a professional tran-
scription company. Participants received compensation in the form of a $50
gift card.
2.4. Analysis
Thematic analysis [19,20] was implemented by the principal investiga-
tor and supported by a graduate assistant (GA). This method was recently
applied to the study of BRCA previvorship as a label of identity [21] and
to explore how previvors share about their experiences on Instagram [3].
The transcripts were manually coded by the principal investigator and the
GA for patterns related to previvor's experiences with healthcare profes-
sionals, including genetic counselors. We elected to follow the two-stage re-
view process recommended to maintain the rigor of the method, including
an initial round of open coding, followed by a discussion of the primary

everyone was asking me when I wanted to have kids, and I wasn't at a place
then.. .1 knew I wanted kids, but I wasn't able to answer that in my early
20s" (INT16).
Family planning conversations are designed not only to help BRCA
previvors decide when to have kids, but also whether they want kids at
all. As BRCA previvors can be diagnosed quite early in life, some say they
were frustrated while interacting with their care team. For example, one
young participant noted that she didn't like how the conversation was cen-
tered around building a family, versus being alive. "I'm thinking more about
the fact that regardless of having a family if I don't do these things I'm not
going to be here for my family. So that's really what's more important to
me is me being here versus the family I'm creating" (INT09). Another par-
ticipant agreed, saying "(It was) extremely frustrating for me, especially
as a 22-year-old with no clear plans to get married or have kids. It re-
ally.. .it was almost like.. .it felt like fearmongering now that I'm out of it"
(INT09).
4. Discussion and conclusion
4.1. Discussion
This study found that while genetic counselors and other providers of-
fered valuable information to patients, previvors felt unprepared emotion-
ally to take on their diagnosis and unsure of whether they would receive
a high quality of care. They believed genetic counselors and providers
gave incomplete information that left them confused and afraid of what
was to come. Providers also made assumptions about previvors' identity
and family planning based on perceived gender, sexual orientation,
and age.
In response to RQI , we found most previvors perceived their communi-
cation with genetic counselors to be positive overall, especially when
previvors took the time to advocate for themselves as a patient. However,
specific interactions were perceived as negative by previvors throughout
their office visit experiences. Feelings of frustration and distress occurred
throughout the previvor experience, as suggested in a similar study [2],
from meeting with genetic counselors to receiving treaunent. Our study
found that even those tangential to the medical intervention process, such
as front-desk staff at medical offices and hospitals, impact the experiences
of previvors.
In response to RQ2, previvors said they felt pushed toward assimilating
with societal norms in appointments with genetic counselors and other pro-
viders. The tendency for genetic counselors to assume a patient's identity
and life goals based on their perceived gender, sexual orientation, and
age can be harmful for BRCA patients, putting them in a position where
they may be encouraged to disclose personal and private information to
correct the assumptions of the genetic counselor. BRCA patients need care
that is personalized to them to reduce the possibility of psychological
harm [1,10—12,21]. Currently, there is a lack of research on identity-
inclusive language and conversation tactics for providers to implement
when discussing treatment and family planning options with BRCA
patients. A recent case study reviewed an experience treating a young
trans-feminine BRCA patient [22]. Even as a child under 18 with BRCA,
the genetic counselor and healthcare providers respected the patient's au-
tonomy and identity by including them in all decisions, listening to their
perspective, and committing to the obligation of clinicians to "do no
harm." This case demonstrates how ethical principles and implementing
patient-centered care can be used to help guide providers and manage un-
certainty for BRCA patients related to their identity and more research is
needed to craft proper guidelines around working with BRCA patients in
this capacity.
Practicing patient-centered care would also encourage counselors to ask
about family planning rather than making assumptions about patients' pref-
erences and values. Recent studies have argued providers require more ef-
fective education regarding specific subgroups and their needs [23]. When
genetic counselors meet with a feminine-presenting patient, they may as-
sume pronouns, sexual orientation, and the desire of their patient to have
PEC Innovation 2 (2023) 100157
children [24]. Pre-screening BRCA patients with surveys about pronouns
and identity and communicating with the patient in an initial meeting
about their life plans might mitigate assumptions. For younger BRCA pa-
tients meeting with genetic counselors, psychosocial needs are an impor-
tant focus when meeting with genetic counselors and family planning. In
a previous study, young BRCA patients noted psychosocial distress as a fac-
tor of family planning much more frequently than was recognized by ge-
netic counselors [25], and as BRCA patients receive diagnoses earlier in
life, providers must consider how their age may impact their treatment
and family planning decisions. Finally, patient-centered care not only per-
tains to the specific provider a patient is seeing but must be threaded
through a patient's entire experience with the healthcare system. Under-
standing that each BRCA previvor is an individual with specific needs for
personalized care will only serve to support that patient in their previvor
journey [2,4].
While strengths of this study include giving voice to BRCA previvors
and their experiences, there were some limitations. First, the interviews
were conducted over Zoom due to COVID-19 limitations and geographical
distance between the researchers and participants, limiting the
interviewer's ability to fully connect with the participant. Video interviews
limit the interviewer's ability to respond to body language and utilize the
participant's physical response to questioning as a guide for future ques-
tions. Additionally, the differences in geographic location of each partici-
pant may be a limitation considering the access to healthcare varies
widely across the United States [26]. Second, participants were recruited
through Instagram and TikTok keeping in line with the larger study objec-
tives. The algorithm present on both platforms most likely pushed the most
popular BRCA previvor accounts to the surface, leaving out valuable partic-
ipants with smaller follower counts. This also meant most participants were
white or white passing. This mirrors similar studies which found very little
social media content created by and for Black previvors and other previvors
of color [3]. We recognize the limitations of this study as the inclusion
criteria was specific to the larger project and thus overlooked previvors' ex-
periences with healthcare providers who do not share about their journey
on social media. Future studies should explore these community members'
perceptions of communication with genetic counselors and other
healthcare providers.
4.2. Innovation
This study offers an innovative lens through which scholars and
healthcare providers may examine the experiences of BRCA previvors as
they seek adequate care. By examining the communicative process of seek-
ing BRCA care rather than the health outcomes of the care itself, we provide
an innovative approach to investigate previvors' perceptions of communi-
cation with genetic counselors and other members of their healthcare
team. This study increases knowledge around the communication processes
of previvors and gives them agency by allowing them to openly share their
personal experiences. Specifically, our findings suggest biases among pro-
viders related to gender, age, and sexual orientation are concerning ele-
ments of family planning communication that potentially interrupt
previvors' abilities to express their care needs in a safe environment. We
argue for an increased awareness of, and advocacy for, more inclusive con-
versations regarding treatment and family planning decisions. This study
also informs the actors we've noted throughout the study including genetic
counselors, other healthcare providers, and policymakers. Scholars should
continue to conduct studies that explore the relationship between BRCA
previvors and providers to ensure previvors are receiving inclusive commu-
nication surrounding family planning and treatrnent options.
5. Conclusion
This article provides an innovative look at BRCA previvors' perceptions
of communication with genetic counselors and other healthcare providers.
Interviews with previvors suggest genetic counselors and healthcare team

treatment based on perceived gender, age, and sexual orientation. BRCA
patients require individualized attention when planning for their future
and making decisions about their healthcare and implementing patient-
centered care practices into the communication process can provide a
higher quality of care. Future research should continue to give agency to
BRCA previvors, especially those from marginalized groups, to reduce
assumptions surrounding treatrnent options and family planning.

Analyzing the Effect of Prenatal Care
on Pregnancy Outcome:
A Conditional Approach
Michael H. Malloy, MD, MS, Tzu-Cheg Kao, PhD, and Y. J. Lee, PhD
ABSTRACT
'Am€ricäniJournalOffÅibiié Health
InfrMuction
Vital statistics data is a readily avail-
able source of information on prenatal
care usage in the United States. How to
examine vital statistics and other types of
data for the effect of prenatal care on preg-
nan%' outcome has generated a number of
different methodologies. 1-4 One of the dif-
ficulties encountered in using such data
has been the problem of overcoming the
preterm bias effect. The preterm bias ef-
fect is associated with observing better
outcomes in women who receive prenatal
care than in women who receive no care.
This artifact occurs because women re-
ceiving no care may deliver prematurely
and may not have an opportunity to enroll
in prenatal care.5 By conditioning the ef-
fect of the age of entry into prenatal care
on the gestational age of delivery, how-
ever, the preterm bias effect can be
avoided. Nonetheless, other problems en-
countered in vital statistics data may in-
validate the results of the conditional ap-
proach.
In this study, we demonstrate the ef-
fect that the possible misclassification of
gestational age in vital statistics data has
on the interpretation of the conditional ap-
proach and discuss the problematic nature
of the evaluation of prenatal care.
The data for this analysis were ob-
tained from linked birth and death certif-
icates from Missouri for 1980 through
1984. The variables used in the analysis
were the gestational age at which prenatal
care was initiated (self-report and limited
to the first 36 weeks of pregnancy), the
gestational age at delivery (based on last
menstrual period), the outcome (stillbirth,
infant death, or alive at 1 year), race
(Black or non-Black), birth number (mul-
tiple vs single), parity, maternal age, and
maternal education. We used only those
records that involved gestational ages of
greater than 19 weeks and less than 51
weeks. Of the 387 173 records available,
375 858 (97.1%) were used for the unad-
justed analyses and 374 244 (96.7%) were
used for the adjusted analyses.
The association of the gestational age
of entry into prenatal care with pregnancy
outcome was examined relative to the ges-
tational age of delivery. Outcomes (still-
births or infant deaths) are presented as
death rates (percentage dead). We calcu-
lated odds ratios for stillbirths or infant
deaths by logistic regression models
adjusted for race (Black vs non-Black),
multiple births (multiple vs single), (O par-
ity and parity greater than 3 compared
with parity 1 through 3), maternal age (less
than 18 and greater than 34 compared with
18 through 34 years), and maternal edu-
cation (less than 12 compared with greater
than 12 years). Mantel-Haenszel tests for
linear trends were carried out for mortality
rates over the gestational ages of entry
into prenatal care.6 Furthermore, we
adjusted our results by declaring new-
borns that exceeded the 90th percentile
birth-weight standards for gestational age
reported by Arbuckle7 as misclassified.
All computations were carried out using
Results
By conditional analysis, the risk (per-
centage of mortality) of stillbirth or infant
death for those women who delivered at
25 weeks to 28 weeks of gestation and who
entered prenatal care between 1 and 4
weeks was greater than the risk of still-

birth or infant death for women who de-
livered at 25 to 28 weeks and received no
care (Table 1). The adjusted odds ratio
was 1.67 (95% confidence interval = 1.03,
2.71). This higher risk of mortality in early
entrants delivering before 29 weeks, how-
ever, appears to be an artifact of the mis-
classification of the gestational age of the
survivors. This is apparent when new-
borns with weights greater than the 90th
percentile for gestational age were not in-
cluded in the analysis (Table 2). The de-
clining mortality rates as the gestational
age of entry into prenatal care increased
observed in Table I are not apparent in
Table 2.
For women delivering after 36 weeks
of gestation, early entry into prenatal care
March 1992, Vol. 82, No. 3
was a marker for optimal pregnancy out-
come. The risk for stillbirth or infant death
increased progressively for those deliver-
ing at 37 through 42 weeks from a low of
0.60% for those who entered prenatal care
at 1 through 4 weeks to a high of 2.96% for
those who received no care (Table 1). The
results for this group in Table 1 are similar
to the results reported in Table 2.
Discussion
As Tyson et al. state, "the value of
prenatal care has been diffcult to estab-
1ish.' '4 When the time of entry into pre-
natal care is assessed relative to the time
of delivery, several interpretations about
the association of prenatal care with preg-
nancy outcome become available. For ex-
ample, it appears that in women who de-
livered at less than 29 weeks and who
entered prenatal care in the first trimester,
there were more adverse pregnancy out-
comes than in those women who delivered
at this tü-ne and were not in prenatal care.
We believe this is an artifact. Kramer et al.
have reported a systematic underestima-
tion of gestational age in infants born be-
fore 37 weeks when the gestational age is
based solely on the last menstrual period.9
When infants weighing over the 90th per-
centile for their gestational age were elim-
inated from the analysis, there were no
ignificant trends in mortality rates over
the gestational age of entry into prenatal
care except for those women delivering

between 37 and 42 weeks. Whether pre-
natal care for these women is responsible
for the better outcome of the early en-
trants cannot be determined. Early entry
may reflect as much on the healthy behav-
ioral characteristics of these women as it
does on any effect of prenatal care.
The evaluation of prenatal care is a
complex problem. The incorrect assign-
ment of gestational age affects signifi-
cantly the results of any perinatal analysis
and continues to be a major problem for
which no solution is readily available. As
a result, there is no ideal model available
to assess the association between prenatal
care and pregnancy outcome. Because of
the substantial problems associated with
observational data, the use of randomized
trials of different modes of care deserves

The safety of Home Birth: The Farm
Study
A. Mark Durand, MI), MPH
Despite a sizable body of literature on
the subject, the authors of two recent re-
views have concluded that a final judg-
ment regarding the relative safety of home
birth still cannot be made.1,2
This study compares the outcomes of
a cohort of 1707 planned lay midwife—
attended home births from the Farm mid-
wifery service in rural Tennessee with the
outcomes of a sample of physician-at-
tended hospital births derived from the
1980 US National Natality/Nationa1 Fetal
Mortality Survey (NNS/NFMS). This is
the largest comparative study of a cohort
of home births yet published.
Previous studies of home birth safety
underscore the importance of having ex-
plicit comparison groups (rather than of
being strictly of considering
planned and unplanned home births
separately,2-4 of tracking intrapartum hos-
pital transfers of intended home births
(and attributing the outcome to the home
birth group),5 and of controlling for the
effects of birth weight, type of delivery
attendant, and demogaphic characteris-
tics of the mother .63 All these issues have
been addressed in this study.
Standards of prenatal care at the
Farm are modeled to the recommenda-
tions of the Arnerican College of Obste-
tricians and Gynecologists. Deliveries are
conducted without analgesia, however,
and great emphasis is placed on meeting
the emotional needs of the family. Several
family members and friends are com-
monly in attendance and are encouraged
to take an active role in the birth.8 In
addition, the laboring woman is encour-
aged to stay off her back and remain phys-
ically mobile through labor and delivery.
In the absence of signs of fetal distress,
women are permitted to labor beyond 24
hours, occasionally for 2 to 3 days. They
are also encouraged to eat and drink dur-
ing labor in the belief that this allays ma-
ternal oåaustion and the need for opera-
tive delivery.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background: Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic are some of the most common toxic metals to which
Canadians are exposed. The effect of exposure to current low levels of toxic metals on fetal growth
restriction is unknown.
Objective: The aim of this study was to examine relationships between exposure to lead, mercury,
cadmium and arsenic during pregnancy, and risk of small for gestational age (SGA) birth.
Methods: Lead, mercury, cadmium and arsenic levels were measured in blood samples from the first
and third trimesters in 1835 pregnant women from across Canada. Arsenic species in first trimester urine
were also assessed. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using log binomial
multivariate regression. Important covariates including maternal age, parity, pre-pregnancy BMI, and
smoking, were considered in the analysis. An exploratory analysis was performed to examine potential
effect modification of these relationships by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in GSTPI and
GSTOI genes.
Results: No association was found between blood lead, cadmium or arsenic and risk for SGA. We ob-
served an increased risk for SGA for the highest compared to the lowest tertile of exposure for mercury
( > 1.6 gg/L, RR- 1.56.; CI— 1.04-2.58) and arsenobetaine ( > 2.25 gg/L, RR- 1.65; CI— 1.10-2.47)
after adjustment for the effects of parity and smoking. A statistically significant interaction was observed
in the relationship between dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) levels in urinary arsenic and SGA between strata
of GSTOI A104A (p for interaction —0.02). A marginally significant interaction was observed in the re-
lationship between blood lead and SGA between strata of GSTPI A114V (p for interaction—O.06).
Conclusions: These results suggest a small increase in risk for SGA in infants born to women exposed to
mercury and arsenic. Given the conflicting evidence in the literature this warrants further investigation
in other pregnant populations.

Pregnant women and their fetuses are especially susceptible to
the effects of exposure to a variety of environmental toxicants
including lead, mercury, cadmium, and arsenic.
Metals are ubiquitous in the environment, and exposure occurs
through ingestion of food, water, soil, or dust; inhalation from air;
and through direct contact with consumer products (Health Ca-
nada, 2004, 2008, 2006). Some known consequences of high level

exposures to these metals in the general population include:
neurological deficits, cancer, renal impairment, convulsions, coma,
and bone disease (Jarup, 2003; Duruibe et al., 2007). Only a few
guidelines exist for metals (e.g., methylmercury) (Legrand et al.,
2010), with more research needed on potential health effects, if
any, of exposure to the low levels of metals to which most of the
general Canadian populations are exposed.
Physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy can alter
toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of environmental chemicals,
such as metals, in the pregnant woman's body. For example, bone
resorption to help meet calcium demands can increase during
pregnancy (Kovacs and Kronenberg, 1997) and release cumulative
lead stores from bone into circulation resulting in an endogenous
source of prenatal exposure (Gulson et al., 2003; Manton et al.,

2003; Téllez-Rojo et al., 2004). Increased maternal plasma volume,
body fat, and body water, coupled with increased excretion, are
designed for optimal nutrient supply and waste removal from the
fetus (Mattison et al., 1991). However, little is known about the
impact of these changes on metabolism and excretion of these
substances during pregnancy and lactation, but they likely will
differ depending on the chemical class or nature of the substance.
Pregnancy is a period of dynamic growth and change for the de-
veloping embryo and fetus, thus, any insults to the in utero en-
vironment could result in suboptimal fetal development (Rice and
Barone, 2000).
Growth restricted fetuses fail to reach their full genetic growth
potential due to a decreased nutrient supply from the utero pla-
cental circulation (Cetin et al., 2004). Intrauterine growth restric-
tion (IUGR) manifests as small for gestational age (SGA), defined as
an infant weighing less than the 10th percentile for their gesta-
tional age and sex (Canadian Institute for Health Information,
2009). Size relative to gestational age is an established predictor of
early childhood mortality and morbidity (Rahman et al., 2009).
Children who are born SGA are more likely to have birth compli-
cations and are at increased risk for excessive weight gain, cardi-
ovascular disease and insulin resistance syndrome later in life
(Clayton et al., 2007). Metals are potential risk factors for SGA
births, and are hypothesized to induce growth restriction through
oxidative stress mediated pathways (Myatt, 2006). Specifically,
when toxic metals are present in the maternal bloodstream, they
may cause abnormal placental function and impair nutrient
transport to the fetus through the indirect formation of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) that
cause oxidative stress by reacting with macromolecules and da-
maging them. When the vascular endothelium is damaged, en-
dothelins are released, causing the smooth muscle around the
blood vessels to contract. This vasoconstriction causes maternal
blood pressure to increase and decreases the blood flow to the
fetus (Pollock and Pollock, 2005). This reduced blood flow may
cause ischemic damage, which could lead to fetal growth restric-
tion and subsequent low birthweight (Llanos and Ronco, 2009).
The elimination half-lives of mercury, lead and cadmium in
blood are 18 days, 30 days and 100 days respectively (Bernard,
1995). These metals are cumulative toxicants, and previous ex-
posure can be detected after long periods of non-exposure (Ber-
nard, 1995). A proportion of lead in the blood may be present

because of bone remodeling mobilizing lead that has been stored
from previous exposure (Smith et al., 2002). In contrast, inorganic
arsenic is rapidly cleared from blood. In humans, it has a half-life
of 10 h (Hughes, 2006). Measurement of urinary arsenic levels is
generally accepted as the most reliable indicator of recent arsenic
exposure, given that arsenic absorbed from the lungs or the gas-
trointestinal tract is excreted in the urine within one to two days,
while arsenic is cleared from blood within a few hours (ASTDR,
2007). However some papers have shown good correlation be-
tween urinary and blood arsenic (Hall et al., 2006).
The effects of lead, cadmium, mercury and arsenic have all been
studied to varying degrees in the context of their effect on fetal
growth outcomes such as small for gestational age (SGA) and low
birthweight (LBW). In general, the literature regarding metal ex-
posure and fetal growth outcomes is inconsistent. Some studies
report an association (Rahman et al., 2009; Llanos and Ronco,
2009; Bellinger et al., 1991; Chen et al., 2006; Foldspang and
Hansen, 1990; Hopenhayn et al., 2003; Kippler et al., 2011; Lee
et al., 2010; Lin et al., 2011 ; Nishijo et al., 2004; Odland et al., 1999;
Osman et al., 2000; Ramön et al., 2009; Shirai et al., 2010; Tian
et al., 2009; Xie et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2010)
while others report no association (Odland et al., 1999; Osman
et al., 2000; Ding et al., 2013; Daniels et al., 2007; Galicia-Garcia
et al., 1997; Jones et al., 2010; Sowers et al., 2002; Menai et al.,
2012; Loiacono et al., 1992; Lucas et al., 2004). Few studies have
examined low-level exposure as currently experienced in most
developed countries such as Canada, thus any resultant health
effects are relatively unknown. The aim of this study was to ex-
amine relationships between exposures to lead (Pb), mercury (Hg),
cadmium (Cd) (as measured in blood) or arsenic (As) (as measured
in blood and urine) during pregnancy and the risk of small for
gestational age birth. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in
GSTPI and GSTOI genes were explored as a potential modifier of
the relationship between lead, cadmium, mercury or arsenic and
SGA.

(MIREC) Study is a prospective cohort study, described in detail
elsewhere (Arbuckle et al., 2013) and summarized here. Between
2008 and 2011, 2001 pregnant women were recruited in the first
trimester of pregnancy from 10 study sites across Canada. Exclu-
Sion criteria included: inability to communicate and consent in
either French or English, greater than 14 weeks gestation at the
time of recruitment, less than 18 years of age, diagnosed with a
fetal anomaly or a history of major chronic disease. Excluded from
this analysis are: 18 women who withdrew during the study, 51
women who gave birth to multiples, 9 stillbirths, 32 spontaneous
abortions, 13 therapeutic abortions, 28 with no metal exposure
data, and 15 with no infant sex, weight, or gestational age re-
corded. The final sample size for this analysis was 1835 mother-
infant pairs.
2.2. Metals exposure
Maternal blood was collected during the first and third trime-
sters of pregnancy and analyzed for total lead, cadmium, mercury,
and arsenic concentrations. Speciated levels of arsenic (arsenite
(As +3) (generally considered to be of most toxicological sig-
nificance (Hughes, 2006)), arsenate (As* 5), monomethylarsenic

acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and arsenobetaine
(AsBe)) were measured in urine samples collected during the first
trimester. Samples were analyzed using inductively-coupled
plasma mass spectrometry by the Toxicology Laboratory of the
Institut National de Santé Publique du Québec (INSPQ). The de-
tection limits for this study were as follows: Blood Pb (0.10 gg/dL),
Cd (0.04 gg/L), total Hg (0.12 gg/L), As (0.225 gg/L). The limit of
detection for all arsenic metabolites in urine was 0.75 gg ASIL
Results below the limit of detection (LOD) were assigned a value of
half of the LOD. As there is uncertainty about the critical trimester
of exposure for fetal growth, various studies have averaged con-
taminant concentrations across pregnancy (e.g. Valvi et al., 2015;
Mora et al., 2015). Blood metal concentrations were based on the
average of the first and third trimester measures if both were
available. If only one measure was available, then that measure
was used. To account for variation in urine dilution due to dis-
parity in sampling, temperature, physical activity and fluid intake
(Suwazono et al., 2008), specific gravity was included as a cov-
ariate in the regression model.
2.3. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
Epidemiological and in vitro studies have suggested that GSTPI
may play a role in mercury and arsenic toxicokinetics (Custodio
et al., 2004; Goodrich and Basu, 2012; Gundacker et al., 2010;
Marcos et al., 2006). The two SNPs under investigation (GSTPI
A114V and GSTPI 1105V) are known to alter enzyme activity

(Strange et al., 2000; Suzuki et al., 1987). Epidemiological studies
using biomarkers have found associations between GSTPI poly-
morphisms and differential metabolism/elimination of arsenic and
mercury (Custodio et al., 2004; Goodrich and Basu, 2012; Gun-
dacker et al., 2010; Marcos et al., 2006). GSTOI is suspected to play
a role in arsenic biotransformation. More specifically, GSTOI has
been shown to catalyse the reduction of monomethylarsonic
(MMA), the rate-limiting step in arsenic detoxification (Zakharyan
et al., 2001), making it a candidate gene in the modification of
arsenic exposure and SGA. The GSTOI A104A SNP has been shown
to affect the functional activity of the enzyme (Punia et al., 2011
Double stranded DNA concentration was assessed using the
Quant-it PicoGreen assay (Invitrogen). Briefly, PicoGreen dye was
added to each well. Following this, the fluorescent signal of the
sample was measured and plotted against the standard DNA
concentration used to make a standard curve.
2.4. Birth outcomes
As part of the MIREC study, each baby's length (cm) and weight
(g) at birth were abstracted from a medical chart review. Gesta-
tional age (weeks) was derived using both the woman's last
menstrual period (LMP) and ultrasound dating. For this analysis,
LMP is the preferred method for estimating gestational age since
ultrasound methods rely on fetal size to estimate gestational age
(Nardozza et al., 2012). If the two methods differed by > 7 days,
then gestational age was determined using ultrasound due to
concerns over recall and reliability of the LMP estimate. SGA births
were identified as those weighing less than the 10th percentile for
a reference population based on the same completed week of
gestation and infant sex (Kramer et al., 2001
2.5. Covariates
This analysis considered the effects of established predictors of
SGA: age, parity, ethnicity, country of origin, household income,
education, smoking status, pre-pregnancy BMI, and marital status.
Information on these factors was collected by questionnaire dur-
ing the first trimester of pregnancy.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Fetal epigenetic programming plays a critical role in development. DNA methyltransferase 3 alpha
(DNMT3A), which is involved in de novo DNA methylation (DNAm), is a prime candidate gene as a mediator
between prenatal exposures and birth outcomes. We evaluated the relationships between in utero arsenic (As)
exposure, birth outcomes, and DNMT3A DNAm.
Methods: In a prospective Bangladeshi birth cohort, cord blood DNAm of three DNMT3A CPGs was measured
using bisulfite pyrosequencing. Maternal toenail As concentrations at birth were measured to estimate in utero
exposure. Among vaginal births (N = 413), structural equation models (SEMs) were used to evaluate re-
lationships between DNMT3A methylation, log2 (toenail As), birth weight, and gestational age.
Results: In an adjusted SEM including birth weight and gestational age, maternal toenail As levels were asso-
ciated with DNMT3A DNAm (B = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.66) and gestational age (B
= —0.19 weeks; 95% Cl:
0.36, —0.03). DNMT3A DNAm was associated with gestational age (B = —
0.10 weeks; 95% Cl: 0.16, -0.04)
and birth weight (B = —11.0 g; 95% CI: 21.5, 0.4). There was an indirect effect of As on gestational age
mediated through DNMT3A DNAm (B
— 0.01), and there were indirect effects of
= -0.04; 95% Cl: 0.08,
maternal toenail As levels on birth weight through pathways including gestational age (B = —
14.4 g; 95% Cl:
29.2, - 1.9), DNMT3A DNAm and gestational age (B =
—3.1 g; 95% CI: 6.6, —0.8), and maternal weight gain
and gestational age (B = —5.1 g; 95% CI: 9.6, — 1.5). The total effect of a doubling in maternal toenail As
concentration is a decrease in gestational age of 2.1 days (95% CI: 0.9, 3.3) and a decrease in birth weight of 29 g
(95% Cl: 14, 46).
Conclusions: DNMT3A plays a critical role in fetal epigenetic programming. In utero arsenic exposure was as-
sociated with greater methylation of CPGs in DNMT3A which partially mediated associations between prenatal
As exposure and birth outcomes. Additional studies are needed to verify this finding.
Chronic exposure to arsenic (As) persists in many regions of the
world. In Bangladesh, approximately 40 million individuals rely on
household drinking water with As concentrations exceeding the World

subsequent fetal exposure (
Concha et al., 1998; Hall et al., 2007). Ar
senic is an established human toxicant and group 1 carcinogen
(World
Health Organization, 2011), and maternal As exposure during fetal
development has been linked to increased risk of adverse health out-
comes later in life including cancers of the lung, bladder, liver, and
larynx; cardiovascular disease; and reduced lung function (Farzan et al.,
2013; Vahter, 2009
). In utero and early life exposure has been asso-
ciated with increased childhood morbidity (
Farzan et al., 2013;
Rahman et al., 2017).
The teratogenic effects of As have been well established in rodent
models (Ferm and Hanlon, 1985; Hill et al., 2008; Hood, 1972; Hood
and Bishop, 1972; Kozul-Horvath et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2019;
Morrissey and Mottet, 1983; Nagymajtényi et al., 1985). Findings from
epidemiological studies of the association between in utero As exposure
and birth outcomes in humans have been inconsistent which is mostly
likely due to differences in study design, exposure assessment, sample
size, population studied, and levels of exposure. Considering the cu-
mulative evidence, a recent review by Milton et al. found an insufficient
number of studies addressing neonatal death and preterm birth but
"consistent and convincing evidence" of the association between high
As exposure and increased risk of spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and
low birth weight (
Milton et al., 2017
). Additionally, a meta-analysis
conducted by Zhong et al. found a negative association between in utero
As exposure and birth weight (
Zhong et al., 2019
). However, little is
known regarding potential mechanisms by which arsenic would affect
these birth outcomes.
Numerous epidemiological studies have examined the association
between in utero As exposure and birth weight, shortened gestation,
and/or intrauterine grown restriction. These birth outcomes have been
shown to have varying effects on disease risk later in life (Wardlaw
et al., 2004
). Shortened gestation is associated with increased risk of
infant mortality, morbidity, and disability, whereas restricted in-
trauterine growth is associated with decreased growth in childhood and
increased morbidity in later in life. Several studies have evaluated birth
weight and gestational age as independent outcomes associated with in
utero As exposure, finding no significant association with either out-
come, particularly at low levels of exposure (Bloom et al., 2016; Freire
et al., 2019
), or a significant negative association with both outcomes
(Xu et al., 2011
). Mediation analyses including birth weight and ge-
stational age may help to understand the health effects of in utero As
exposure. For example, in this cohort our group found that the in utero
As exposure was related to gestational age and maternal weight gain
during pregnancy, and these factors mediated the effect between As and
birth weight (
Kile et al., 2015
). Subsequently, there was no direct effect
of As on birth weight in this cohort.
Changes in the epigenome, including DNA methylation (DNAm),
may be one mechanism underlying the associations between As ex-
posure and multiple health outcomes (Bailey et al., 2016; Bjørklund
et al., 2018). As explained by the developmental origins of health and
disease hypothesis, environmental exposures during embryogenesis, a
time of cellular differentiation and epigenetic reprogramming, may
result in epigenetic dysregulation and increased disease risk (
Heindel
and Vandenberg, 2015). The DNA methyltransferases 3 alpha
(DNMT3A) and 3 beta (DNMT3B) are responsible for de novo DNAm in
embryonic cells (Okano et al., 1999
). DNMT3A and DNMT3B have
differential spatial and temporal expression during early embryogenesis
). DNMT3A may have a more significant role in
Uysal et al., 2017
maintaining global DNAm, particularly at distal promotors and non-
), and in imprinting (Kaneda et al., 2004)
CpG sites (
Gu et al., 2018
DNMT3A is also involved in RNA polymerase binding and transcription,
genetic imprinting, mitotic cell cycle, protein binding, aging, and reg-
ulation of cell death. Although the role of DNMT3A in birth outcomes
has not fully been established, DNAm within the gene body of DNMT3A
has previously been associated with reduced gestational age in a Nor-
wegian birth cohort (PFDR =
Bohlin et al., 2016).
0.03) (
Due to the critical role of DNMT3A in establishing de novo DNAm,
we hypothesized that DNAm of this gene could mediate the association
between As exposure occurring in the critical prenatal development
phase and adverse birth outcomes, specifically birth weight and ge-
stational age. We also hypothesized that gestational age would act as a
mediator between in utero As exposure, epigenetic changes, and birth
weight. We explored this hypothesis using structural equation models
(SEMs) with our a priori hypothesis depicted in
Fig. 1.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
Participants were from a prospective birth cohort of women exposed
to As through drinking water in Bangladesh in the Sirajdikhan and
Pabna Sadar upazilas. This cohort has been described in detail pre-
viously (Kile et al., 2014). Briefly, women were recruited at s 16 weeks
gestations age by Dhaka Community Hospital (DCH) Trust (N 1458).
Eligibility criteria were having a single pregnancy, using a tube well as
the main source of drinking water, and planning to remain in the cur-
rent residence for the duration of the pregnancy. Women received free
prenatal care provided by DCH, as well as prenatal vitamins, which
were given to participants during monthly home visits. Women gave
birth with DCH-trained medical personnel at a local clinic or at their
home who collected all birth outcome data and cord blood was col-
lected at birth. This analysis utilized a sub-sample of 569 newborns
from the cohort that were selected for measurement of DNAm in whole
cord blood using pyrosequencing. This sub-sample was randomly se-
lected across a range of arsenic exposure that was measured in the
household's drinking water. We also restricted analyses to only vaginal
births to minimize the possibility of confounding which limited the
final sample size to 413 newborns.

2.2. Ethics
The study protocol was approved by the Human Research
Committees at the Harvard School of Public Health, Oregon State
University, and DCH Trust. Prior to enrollment in the study, informed
consent was obtained from all participants.
2.3. Laboratory measures
Maternal toenail As: Arsenic concentrations in maternal toenail
samples were measured as a biomarker of exposure during pregnancy.
Arsenic has an affinity for sulfhydryl groups and accumulates in scler-
oproteins, and therefore toenail As concentrations at the distal tip re-
presents a time-integrated measure of ingested As during the previous
9—12 months of nail growth and has been shown in previous research to
be highly correlated with water arsenic concentrations (Karagas et al.,
1996; Rodrigues et al., 2015
). Toenail clippings were collected from
mothers at the time of enrollment (e.g. maternal toenails at enrollment)
and within one month of delivery (e.g. postpartum maternal toenails).
The methods used to measure arsenic exposure have been previously
published (Rodrigues et al., 2015). Briefly, samples were sonicated in
1% Triton X-IOO solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis, MO) and
rinsed in Milli-Q water (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA) to remove
external contamination. Then, nails were digested in Trace Select Ultra
Pure nitric acid (HN03; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) and diluted with Milli-Q
water. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used to
measure total arsenic concentrations (PerkinElmer Model DRC-II 6100,
Norwalk, CT). Arsenic concentrations of human hair references were
used to correct for method error using black correction and normal-
ization (CRM Hair; Shanghai Institute of Nuclear Research, Academia
Sinica, China); human hair was selected as the reference due to lack of
available toenail references. Eighteen postpartum toenail samples were
missing. Samples were dropped from analyses if they had a mass < 5
mg (N = 1) or relative standard deviation > 25% (N = 3). One
sample below the batch limit of detection (ranging 0.004—0.85 gg As/g)
was also excluded.
Maternal drinking water As: At the time of enrollment, participants
were asked to identify their main source of drinking water (Kile et al.,
). Water samples were collected, preserved with ultrapure nitric
2014
acid to a pH < 2, and stored at room temperature. Arsenic con-
centrations in water samples were measured using inductively coupled
mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with the US EPA method 200.8 (Environ-
mental Laboratory Services, North Syracuse, NY) (Creed et al., 1994)
Samples had an average percent recovery from plasmaCal multi-ele-
ment QC standard #1 solution (SCP Science) of 102 ± 7%. Thirty
samples below the LOD of 1 gg/L were replaced with LOD/2.
Bisulfite pyrosequencing: DNAm was quantified for cg26544247
(GRCh37/hg19, located on the north shore of a CpG
island (chr2:25474757-25475598) within the gene body of DNMT3A.
These CpG sites were selected as the target site for bisulfite pyr-
osequencing because they were included on the Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Our rationale for this choice was to
help make the pyrosequencing data in this study relevant to other
methylation array data. Coverage also included two downstream CpG
sites (chr2:25,473,813 and chr2:25,473,843). Bisulfite pyrosequencing
was performed at EpigenDx (Hopkinton, MA) using 20 ng/ul whole
cord blood DNA. Bisulfite conversion was used to convert unmethylated
cytosines to uracil. Following PCR amplification and direct pyr-
osequencing, the average percent DNAm was calculated. Control sam-
ples with low methylation, medium methylation, and high methylation
were included on each plate.
Covariates: Sociodemographic data were collected by trained inter-
viewers during clinical visits. Infant birth weight was measured by
trained study staff using a pediatric scale calibrated before each use.
Gestational age in weeks was determined by ultrasound measurements
taken at enrollment by a licensed general practitioner using either (1)
Environmental Research 183 (2020) 109134
gestational sac mean diameter if the pregnancy was between 4 and 7
weeks or, (2) crown-rump length if the pregnancy was between 7 and
16 weeks.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated for all variables. Maternal
toenail As concentrations were right skewed and therefore log2 trans-
formed. We assessed relationships between loci with quantified DNAm
(cg26544247, chr2:25473813, and chr2:25473843) using Spearman
correlations. Statistical mediation was evaluated using SEMs that in-
cluded DNAm of all measured loci. SEMs are a multivariate statistical
technique that allow for confirmatory analysis of a given hypothesis
(Gunzler et al., 2013). By simultaneously estimating multiple and re-
lated regression-like models, SEMs allow for a given variable to act as
both an independent and dependent variable (the term "exogenous" is
used to refer to variables that act only as independent variables, and the
term "endogenous" is used to refer to variables that act as dependent
variables in at least one modeled regressions). SEMs use underlying
latent (or unmeasured) variables defined by observed variables re-
presenting same construct, therefore addressing some forms of multi-
collinearity. DNAm of
chr2:25473813, and
cg26544247,
chr2:25473843 was used as indicator variables to construct a latent
variable representing DNAm of DNMT3A. Confirmatory factor analysis
was performed to test how well DNAm of the three CpG sites represent
DNAm of DNMT3A region.
To understand the associations between As concentrations, DNAm
of DNMT3A, and birth weight independent of gestational age, we first
built an SEM including logytransformed maternal toenail As con-
centrations as independent variable, birth weight as the dependent
variable, and the latent variable representing DNAm of DNMT3A as a
mediator. We similarly assessed associations between As concentra-
tions, DNAm of DNMT3A, and gestational age independent of birth
weight. A single SEM including both outcomes of interest (birthweight
and gestational age) was then used to assess mediation, adjusting for
the potential confounders of infant sex, and maternal education
( > primary vs. primary education), and the potential mediator of
maternal weight gain between enrollment and delivery. Covariates
were selected based on a review of previous literature and observed
univariate associations between As exposure and birth outcomes in the
current study. Birth weight was modeled in kg to ensure variances were
similarly scaled. The full information maximum likelihood approach
(FIML) was used to estimate model parameters, and robust estimates of
model fit were used due to skewness in DNAm variables (Brosseau-Liard
et al., 2012; Brosseau-Liard and Savalei, 2014). For models including
categorical covariates (i.e., infant sex and maternal education), stan-
dard errors were calculated from 10,000 bootstrap samples. In each
SEM, model indices were examined to determine if including residual
correlations would improve model fit.
Our primary measure of exposure was postpartum maternal toenail
As concentrations. Toenail As concentrations provide a time-integrated
biomarker of internal dose that reflects arsenic exposure from all routes
of exposure that occurred several months to a year prior to their col-
lection (
Kile et al., 2005
). Therefore, postpartum maternal toenail As
concentrations were selected to reflect the internal As dose that oc-
curred during pregnancy. We conducted sensitivity analyses using two
other arsenic exposure metrics: log2 (maternal toenail As concentra-
tions at enrollment) and log2 (maternal water As concentrations). In
addition, we used linear models to test the associations between DNAm
of the target CpG site (cg26544247), logytransformed postpartum
maternal toenail As concentrations, birth weight, and gestational age.
Specifically, we evaluated associations between the exposure (maternal
toenail As concentration) and outcome (gestational age and birth-
weight), the mediator (DNAm) and the exposure (maternal toenail As
concentrations), and the mediator (DNAm) and the outcome (gesta-
tional age and birthweight).

3. Results
3.1. Participant characteristics
Measures of DNAm was available for 413 infants born by vaginal
births. Maternal and infant characteristics are summarized in
Table 1.
Approximately half of the infants were male (52.7%). The median ±
IQR maternal drinking water As concentrations at recruitment was
17.0 ± 73.5 gg/L (range: 0.5—545.0 gg/L), and the mean maternal
toenail As concentrations at delivery was 1.7 ± 3.2 ng/gg (range:
0.04—34.8). The median gestational age was 38 ± 3 weeks (range:
22—42 weeks), and the median birth weight was 2800 ± 600 g (range:
1400—4600 g). Consistent with other birth cohort studies in Bangladesh,
there was a high rate of preterm birth (< 37 weeks gestation, 29.0%)
(Shah et al., 2014
) and low birth weight (< 2500 g, 25.9%) (
Monawar
Hosain et al., 2005)
Relatively, levels of DNAm at each of the CPG sites were low. The
median ± IQR percent methylation for the CPG sites were 2.5 ± 6.1,
2.1 ± 5.3, 0.0 ± 3.6 for cg26544247 (chr2: 25,473,782),
and respectively. DNAm of was
significantly and positively correlated between all CPG sites measured
). There was a trend toward in-

3.2. Mediation analysis
A latent variable representing DNMT3A methylation was con-
structed using percent methylation of cg26544247, chr2:25,473,813,
and chr2:25,473,843. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that
DNAm measured at cg26544247, chr2:25473813, and chr2:25473843
represented DNAm of DNMT3A well (X 2 P-value < 0.001; Root mean
square error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.00; Standardized root
mean squared residual = 0.00; Comparative fit index (CFI) = 1.00;
Tucker-Lewis/non-normed fit index 1.00).
We first assessed mediation of the associations between logytrans-
formed postpartum maternal toenail As concentrations and birth out-
comes by DNAm of DNMT3A in separate SEMs for birth weight and
gestational age. We observed a significant positive association between
maternal As levels and DNMT3A DNAm (B 0.37; 95% Cl: 0.12, 0.62)
in an SEM for the mediated effect of logytransformed postpartum

maternal toenail As concentrations on birth weight. We also observed a
significant negative association between DNMT3A DNAm and birth
weight (B
Supplemental Table Sl and
-20.7 g; 95% Cl: 32.3, -9.1) (
Supplemental Fig. Sl). The direct effect of maternal As levels on birth
weight was not significant (B = 1.6 g; 95% CI: 26.5, 29.8); however,
the indirect effect of maternal As levels on birth weight through
DNMT3A DNAm was statistically significant (B
- -7.6 g; 95% Cl:
— 1.5). Similarly, in an SEM for the mediated effect of logy
13.8,
transformed postpartum maternal toenail As concentrations on gesta-
tional age through DNMT3A methylation, there was a significant posi-
tive association between maternal As levels and DNMT3A DNAm
(B = 0.39; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.65), and a significant negative association
between DNMT3A DNAm and gestational age (B
-0.12 weeks; 95%
Supplemental Table S2
and
Cl: 0.18, -0.05) (
Supplemental Fig. S2)
Both the direct and indirect effects of maternal As levels on gestational
age were statistically significant (direct effect: B
-0.25 weeks; 95%
— 0.08; indirect effect: B
-0.05 weeks; 95% Cl: 0.08,
Cl: 0.43,
-0.01).
Subsequently, we constructed a single SEM to test for the indirect
effects of logytransformed postpartum maternal toenail As concentra-
tions on birth weight and gestational age through DNMT3A DNAm. This
model accounted for an indirect effect of maternal As exposure on birth
weight though gestational age, but we did not include the direct effect
of As exposure on birth weight because of the prior results of our in-
dividual models (Tables 2 and 3,
and Fig. 4
). There was a significant
positive association between logytransformed postpartum maternal
toenail As concentrations and DNMT3A methylation (B 0.39; 95% CI:
0.14, 0.65), and negative associations between maternal toenail As le-
vels and gestational age (B =
-0.25 weeks; 95% Cl: 0.42, -0.08), and
between DNMT3A DNAm and gestational age (B
-0.12 weeks; 95%
— 0.06). There were also significant indirect effects of ma-
Cl: 0.18,
ternal toenail As levels on gestational age through DNMT3A methyla-
- -0.05 weeks; 95% Cl: 0.09, -0.01). The direct effect of
tion (B
DNMT3A DNAm on birth weight and the indirect effect of maternal
toenail As levels on birth weight through DNMT3A DNAm did not
achieve significance (B —
- -10.1 g; 95%
Cl: 21.2, 1.0 and B
- -4.0 g; 95% Cl: 8.6, 0.6, respectively).
However, we observed a significant association between gestational age
and birth weight (B = 77.4 g; 95% CI: 62.0, 92.7) and significant in-
direct effects of maternal toenail As levels on birth weight through
gestational age (B
— 5.5) and through
- -19.5 g; 95% Cl: 33.5,
DNMT3A DNAm and gestational age (B
-3.6 g; 95% Cl: 6.8, -0.4).
Similar results were observed in an SEM including infant sex, ma-
ternal weight gain, and maternal education (
and
Table 4,
Fig. 5
). Fit
indices for this final model indicated good model fit (Table 5). Maternal
toenail As levels were significantly associated with DNMT3A DNAm
(B 0.40; 95% Cl: 0.15, 0.66) and gestational age (B -
— —0.19 weeks;
95% Cl: 0.36, -0.03), and DNMT3A DNAm was significantly associated
with gestational age (B
- -0.10 weeks; 95% Cl: 0.16, -0.04) and
birth weight (B
—0.4). There was a sig-
- -11.0 g; 95% Cl: 21.5,
nificant indirect effect of maternal toenail As levels on gestational age
through DNMT3A methylation (B
= -0.04 weeks; 95% Cl: 0.08,
— 0.01), and significant indirect effects of maternal toenail As levels on
birth weight through gestational age (B
- -14.4 g; 95% Cl: 29.2,
— 1.9), through DNMT3A DNAm and gestational age (B =
-3.1 g; 95%
CI: 6.6, — 0.8), and through maternal weight gain and gestational age
— 1.5). Calculated from the adjusted SEM,
(B - -5.1 g; 95% Cl: 9.6,
the total effect of a doubling in maternal toenail As concentration is a
decrease in gestational age of 2.1 days (95% CI: 0.9—3.3) and a decrease
in birth weight of 29 g (95% CI: 14, 46).
3.3. Sensitivity analyses

As levels on birth weight through gestational age were not significant,
although the effect estimates were negative (B
= -0.06 weeks; 95%
Cl: 0.13, 0.02 and B
- -4.5 g; 95% Cl: 10.4, 1.3, respectively)
(Supplemental Table S4 and Fig. S4)
We also assessed the associations between in utero As exposure,
birth outcomes, and DNMT3 DNAm using linear models to confirm
results obtained through SEMs. Specifically, we evaluated associations
between the exposure (postpartum maternal toenail As levels) and
outcomes (birth weight and gestational age), the mediator (represented
by the target CpG site DNMT3, cg26544247) and the exposure (post-
partum maternal toenail As levels), and the mediator (DNMT3 DNAm)
and the outcomes (birthweight and gestational age). Results from un-
adjusted models and models adjusted for infant sex, maternal weight
gain, and maternal education are shown in
Supplemental Table S5.
Results from crude and adjusted linear models were consistent with
SEMs. In adjusted models, logytransformed postpartum maternal toe-
nail As concentrations were associated with decreased gestational age
(B — —0.16 weeks, 95% CI: 0.27, —0.04) and increased methylation of
cg26544247 (B 0.44; 95% Cl: 0.14, 0.74), DNAm of cg26544247 was
associated with decreased gestational age (B = —
0.09 weeks; 95% Cl:
0.13, —0.04) and birth weight (B =
-12.6 g; 95% Cl: 24.8, -6.4), and
gestational age was associated with birth weight (B = 79.1 g; 95% CI:
60.7, 97.5). Maternal As levels were not significantly associated with
birth weight (B 1.9 g; 95% Cl: 25.6, 29.5).
4. Discussion
We observed that DNAm of DNMT3A mediated the association be-
tween in utero As exposure and birth outcomes. We found that increased
logytransformed postpartum maternal toenail As concentrations were
associated with increased DNMT3A methylation and decreased gesta-
tional age, and there was a negative indirect effect of As on gestational
age through DNMT3A methylation. In addition, we observed negative
indirect effects of maternal toenail As levels on birth weight through

The indirect effect of maternal As levels on birth weight through
DNMT3A methylation alone did not achieve statistical significance.
Overall, a doubling in maternal toenail As concentration was associated
with a decrease in gestational age of 2.1 days and a decrease in birth
weight of 28.9 g. We used an SEM approach that is advantageous for
testing mediators that are located on a causal pathway (i.e., variables
that act as a dependent variable in one model and as an independent
variable in another model) (Gunzler et al., 2013). Furthermore, SEMs
incorporate unmeasured latent variables representing multiple, related
indicator variables (i.e., measured variables). This helps to address

proaches (
Geoffrey Maruyama, 1998). Although commonly used in
other fields of research, SEMs can be a valuable tool in environmental
epidemiology for understanding complex relationships (Buncher et al.,
1991). In this study, SEMs allowed us to create a latent variable re-
presenting DNAm of three correlated CpG sites located in the gene body
of DNMT3A and simultaneously evaluate the direct and indirect effects
of in utero As exposure on birth outcomes.
Our results are consistent with other studies finding a negative as-
sociation between in utero As exposure and gestational age (Röllin et al.,
2017; Xu et al., 2011), although some studies have reported a

Characteristics of study populations overall, including level of ex-
posure, As methylation capacity, and maternal diet, may contribute
these differences. It should also be noted that epidemiological studies
have generally analyzed associations with preterm birth (< 37 weeks
gestation), rather than gestational age (Bloom et al., 2014). However,
health effects later in life may be associated with early term, in addition
to preterm, birth (
). Furthermore, this clinical cate-
Boyle et al., 2012
gorization may not be sufficient to detect variation in gestational age,
and may be not be appropriate for populations with high rates of pre-
term birth such as Bangladesh (Shah et al., 2014). In fact, 29% of births
in our study population were preterm (
Table 1
). While we did not ob-
serve a direct effect of in utero As exposure on birth weight, we did find
a significant total effect of As exposure on birth weight fully mediated
through pathways including gestational age. Although, mediation
through DNAm of DNMT3A alone did not achieve statistical sig-
nificance. Multiple epidemiological studies have investigated the effects
of in utero As exposure on birth weight (as reviewed by Bloom et al.,
Milton et al., and Zhong et al., 16,17,46). Our results, however, indicate
the importance of including gestational age as a birth outcome of in-
terest, and addressing the inter-relationship between these birth out-
comes. Furthermore, decreased birth weight may be due to shortened
gestational period and/or intrauterine grown restriction (Wardlaw
). Investigating the etiology of observed reductions in birth
et al., 2004
weight is important to understanding the health effects of in utero As
exposure.
Consistent with our findings, DNAm of the target CpG site,
cg26544247, has previously been negatively associated with gesta-
tional age in a Norwegian birth cohort (PFDR
Bohlin et al.,
0.03) (
). This study also found differential methylation throughout the
2016
epigenome (44,359 probes at < 0.05 for ultrasound-estimated
gestational age and 44,544 probes for last menstrual period-estimate
gestational age at PFDR < 0.05). However, 18 additional CpG sites
annotated to DNMT3A were identified as differentially methylated and
a gene ontology (GO) analysis identified several pathways that included
the DNMT3A gene. In addition, in birth cohort in Tennessee, one CpG
annotated to DNMT3A was identified as associated with gestational age
0.04) (Parets et al., 2013
). Methylation at additional CpG sites
(PFDR
located in DNMT3A have been associated with the in utero environment.
Specifically, increased methylation in cord blood of cgl 3344237, lo-
cated within 200 base pairs of the transcription start site, has been
associated with lower maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (underweight <
18.5 kg/m2 vs. normal 18.5—24.9 kg/m2) (PFDR
Sharp et al.,
0.02) (
). Increased methylation in cord blood of cg15843262, located in
2015
the gene body, was associated with antidepressant use during preg-
nancy (p 8 x 10 4) (Non et al., 2014).
The role of DNMT3A in de novo DNAm is well-established (Okano
et al., 1999
), and DNMT3A is expressed during embryogenesis
Environmental Research 183 (2020) 109134
Watanabe et al., 2002). However, how DNMT3A may affect birth
outcomes is not well understood. DNMT3A is involved in multiple, di-
verse biological pathways; GO terms annotated to DNMT3A include
roles in DNAm, RNA polymerase binding and transcription, genetic
imprinting, mitotic cell cycle, protein binding, aging, and regulation of
cell death. Further research is needed to understand the biological
pathways involved in the observed association between DNMT3A me-
thylation and birth outcomes.
Our study strengths included that gestational age was determined
by ultrasound at the time of enrollment, which provides a more accu-
rate estimation than reported last menstrual period. In addition, our
study is strengthened by the prospective birth cohort design with
multiple measures of As exposure during pregnancy. Toenail As con-
centrations reflect exposure during the prior several months to a year
(Kile et al., 2005
). Maternal toenail samples were collected within one
moth of delivery to provide an estimate of internal dose during preg-
nancy and establish temporality. Drinking water samples and maternal
toenail samples were also collected at the time of enrollment early in
pregnancy. Overall, results from sensitivity analyses using maternal
drinking water As levels and maternal toenail As concentration at en-
rollment as the measures of exposure were consistent. The slight dif-
ferences in results could be a function of exposure misclassification
from using drinking water arsenic concentrations instead of biomarkers
of internal dose (e.g., toenails), or differences in As metabolism and
excretion between individuals (Marchiset-Ferlay et al., 2012
There is
evidence that the As metabolism may be associated with birth outcomes
(Gelmann et al., 2013) and may also influence DNAm. Sex has also been
shown to influence arsenic metabolism. Subsequently, future studies
could examine As metabolism modifies DNAm of DNAMT3A and birth
outcomes.
Several limitations of our study should be noted. We had missing
data on maternal toenail As concentrations (N 21 for maternal toe-
nail concentrations at enrollment, N 23 for postpartum maternal
toenail concentrations). Gestational age and birth weight were lower
among mother-infant pairs with missing maternal toenail As con-
centrations at enrollment (mean gestational age: with missing
data 34.3 weeks, without missing data 37.6 weeks; Kruskal-Wallis
p = 0.003; mean birth weight: with missing data 2481 g, without
missing data
2764 g; Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.012) and postpartum
(mean gestational age: with missing data
34.5 weeks, without
missing data =
37.6 weeks; Kruskal-Wallis p
0.005; mean birth
weight: with missing data 2510 g, without missing data = 2763 g;
Kruskal-Wallis p = 0.018). However, we had full data on maternal
water As concentrations, and maternal drinking water concentrations
were significantly correlated and toenail As concentrations at enroll-
0.60, p < 0.001) and postpartum (rspeannan = 0 61
(r Spearman
p < 0.001). Although in sensitivity analyses using maternal water As
levels we observed reduced significance of the indirect effect of in utero
As on birth weight through DNMT3 methylation and gestational age,
the confidence intervals were wide and tended toward a negative as-
sociation (logytransformed maternal water As DNMT3A DNAm

- -2.01 (-4.59, 0.16), p 0.095; logy
transformed maternal water As gestational age birth weight: B
- -4.52 (-10.45, 1.28), p 0.125). Furthermore, SEMs
(95% CD
allow for the inclusion of cases with missing data on some exogenous
variables, and therefore participants with missing data on maternal
toenail As concentration could be still be used to estimate parameters
for other pathways in the model.
We did not have data on DNAm at additional DNMT3A CpG sites
and did not measure gene expression. Therefore, we cannot determine
if changes in DNAm at the interrogated CPGs of DNMT3A lead to
changes in gene expression or chromatin conformation. Nor can we
infer that methylation at these 3 CpG sites represent methylation across
the entire gene. The three CPGs measured in the current study are lo-
cated with the gene body, and DNAm within gene bodies has previously
been associated with gene expression, (

Abstract—The scientific article evaluates the current areas
of health care management in the context of population aging.
The peculiarities of population aging in some countries and
regions (according to the level of economic development) have
been clarified; including among women and men. The main
structural reasons that determine the rate of population aging
are identified: demographic, social, economic, environmental.
The consequences of population aging for Ukrainian society,
first of all its impact on the health care system, have been
identified. The state of health of elderly people in Ukraine is
analyzed and the priority directions of its preservation are
substantiated. The methodological principles of calculating the
health index and determining the characteristics of population
inequality in terms of health from the standpoint of population
aging (separately for men and women) are summarized. The
main goals of health care development in the context of aging
and the COVID-19 pandemic have been identified.
Keywords—health care system management, population
aging, population health, health index, demographic processes.
I. INTRODUCTION
Population aging is a global phenomenon that has attracted
the attention of scientists and practitioners for many decades.
In 2020, there were 727 million people aged 65 and over in
the world. Most of them are women, as they usually live
longer than men. Over the next three decades, the number of
older people worldwide is projected to increase to more than
double reaching over 1.5 billion by 2050. The proportion of
the population aged 65 and over is expected to increase from
9.3 % in 2020 to approximately 16.0% in 2050 [1]
The aging process now covers almost all countries in the
world (except 18, which are defined by the UN as countries
with "demographic differences" [2]). In some countries, this
process began in the middle of the last century, in another -in
the last decades. Therefore, the rate of population aging varies
from country to country. Typically, in countries where the
aging process has begun earlier, the rate of aging is currently
low (e.g. Sweden, Fig. l), while in developing countries it is
higher and very high is expected (e.g. Mexico or China, Fig.
1).
Factors that determine the rate of population aging
include: deformation of the sex and age structure of the
978-1-6654-1854-6/21/$31.00 02021 IEEE
population, the level of economic development and welfare of
citizens, the dynamics of the health care and social security
system, the state of the environment etc.

Of course, population aging is directly related to changes
in births and marriages, cohabitation and divorce, general
trends in education among the population, especially young
people, and migration processes, including from rural to urban
areas and international migration. The main causes of
population aging are still declining birth rates and prolonging
life expectancy.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
Many works of domestic and foreign scientists and
practitioners are devoted to the study of the problems of
population aging and its consequences. In the context of the
purpose and objectives of this article, several areas of research
can be identified: the concept of demographic transition,
general changes in age structure, socio-economic aspects of
this process, the health of an aging population and challenges
to the health system.

First of all, it should be noted that the problem of
population aging has been the focus of international, regional
and national institutions for many decades. In particular, the
UN, whose experts publish annual reports "Aging of the
world" [1], the World Health Organization conducts research
that highlights the results on the health and well-being of
adults, their relationship to the aging process in different
countries now and in the future in the reports: Decade of
Healthy Aging Plan of Action [4], World report on aging and
health [5], Researchers of the US National Institute on Aging
and the US National Institutes of Health are conducting joint
research, including "Why Population Aging Matters »[6].
Due to the fact that population aging is one of the
manifestations of age structure transformation in the process
of demographic transition, a special place in assessing the
peculiarities of the aging process belongs to the concept of
demographic transition
changing types of population
reproduction, which is covered in a number of scientific
papers [7-10]. It is also worth noting that the assessment of the
age structure of the population and its future changes allows a
deeper understanding of the peculiarities of reproduction in
general and aging processes in particular [11, 12].
Scientists actively discuss the socio-economic aspects of
population aging [13-15]. The research takes place in two
directions: the impact of socio-economic development on the
level of population aging and its socio-economic
consequences.
This topic is reflected in the works of Ukrainian scientists.
The most fundamental work, which highlights the latest
features of the aging population and its prospects, the specifics
of lifestyle and socio-economic status of the elderly, the
challenges to social and economic development caused by
demographic aging, is a collective monograph of scientists
from the Institute of Demography and Social Research named
after MV Ptukha of the National Academy of Sciences of
Ukraine [16].
III. CURRENT TRENDS OF AGING
Despite the general tendency of population aging in the
world, the similarity of causes and effects, there are some
differences between regions and countries. More in-depth
research shows that there is no "hard standard" for identifying
the causes of aging. There are differences between countries
in the mode of reproduction, in particular in the birth rate;
gender and age structures, which were formed in different
historical conditions, were under the influence of various
factors (wars, epidemics, pandemics, economic crises);
migration regimes (predominance of emigration or
immigration), etc. The imposition of these and other
circumstances causes fluctuations in the rate of population
aging between countries and regions.
Undoubtedly, one of the main reasons that determine the
peculiarities of population aging are socio-economic. In fig.
2-3. the dynamics of growth of the share of people aged 65
and older among the total population by countries with
different socio-economic development, Ukraine, and some
European countries (Sweden and Poland) by sex is shown.
The difference in population aging is quite significant
between countries with a high level of economic development
and countries with medium and low levels of development.
And here the question is not only about the difference in
economic opportunities and what is connected with it: the
level of medical and social services, the state of health literacy,
the quality of living and nutrition, etc., ie those determinants
that allow you to live longer. Factors of such differentiation
are also indicators of a mode of reproduction. In economically
developed countries, birth rates and other marriage regimes
are significantly lower. This may in some way explain the fact
that Ukraine, which is not one of the countries with a high
level of economic development, has a high rate of population
aging, especially among women.

Other features of aging, which are shown in Fig. 3—4. First
of all, they concern the difference in mortality rates between
men and women between different countries and regions. It is
obvious that aging is greater among women than among men.
However, there are countries where this difference is quite
significant. Thus, in Ukraine the share of people 65 years and
older among women exceeds the same figure for men by 1.72
times, while on average in other countries this figure is 1.25
times. In addition, while over the last 60 years the gap between
men and women 65 and older in most countries has narrowed,
in Ukraine it has widened. In our opinion, this indicates an
extremely unsatisfactory state of health of the male population
of the country in general and older age groups in particular.

digital data standards, such as: HL77, FHIR HL78, CDISC9
and FAIRIO [24].
Taking into account the world experience of digital
transformation of the social sphere and developed domestic
approaches, it is possible to verify further vectors of digital
transformation of the healthcare sphere of Ukraine, which
should include: introduction of valeological approaches in
providing medical services through prevention and health
promotion; digital ecosystem of medical services, which will
unite all subjects of their provision; the transition from a
fragmented approach to health care delivery to the integration
and coordination of services during treatment.
Covid-19 stressed the vulnerability of an aging population
to new diseases. Therefore, at present the issue of healthy
aging is especially relevant.
V. METHODS OF CONSTRUCTING THE INDEX OF
POPULATION HEALTH
Health status index models have received a great deal of
attention in as a new quantitative approach for health
planning and health policy making. Although at the present
time the models are mainly theoretical and experimental in
nature, it is hoped that when they are fully developed and
ready for implementation, they will contribute to rational
health planning in two ways: first, by providing a combined
morbidity-mortality health index to measure the overall
health of a population and to allow comparisons of
populations on both a cross-sectional and longitudinal basis;
and second, by providing a method of measuring the health
benefits of a health care program in general units, to facilitate
the comparison of different programs in the establishment of
program priorities and in the allocation of limited resources
[25] •
In 2004, Kaltenthaler et al published a systematic review
to identify articles describing population health indices and
their development [26]. Nevertheless, Kaltenthaler et al
argued that a review on population health indices is beneficial
because indices may facilitate the consideration of allocating
and targeting health resources based on health needs from a
multidimensional perspective .
In addition, the development of health indices is
knowledgeable for understanding the nature of the factor-
consequence relationships between the factors of health and
its level. After all, a population health index therefore
provides a summary measure of a certain health characteristic
at the population level [27].
In order to better illustrate the aging process and the
impact on it of various factors, it is advisable to use the health
index (ISH), which was proposed by one of the co-authors of
the article, Shushpanov D. (2017). The health status index is
defined for each person as a composite index, which consists
of the individual health index of the IIP person, and the life
expectancy index of the ILE person according to the
The life expectancy index (ILE) is defined as a person's
age plus life expectancy at that age, taking into account gender
and type of area. The maximum life expectancy is assumed to
be 100 years. The minimum is 67 years.
According to the methodology of construction, ISH
combines individual and general: individual characteristics of
a person's health and general characteristics of the whole set
of persons, taking into account their gender and living
conditions in a particular country. It should be expected that
with age IIH will tend to decrease, and ILE, on the contrary,
to increase. Accordingly, the compositional index ISH
balances these trends and, thus, adequately reflects the state of
health of a person based on potential (expected) processes and
the actual age reached in a particular country.
Consider examples of calculation and use of indices and
characteristics of inequality for the population of Ukraine.
Individual health characteristics are determined according to
a sample survey "European Social Survey" conducted by the
Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences of
Ukraine in 2014. At the same time, five levels of self-esteem
are set for each person. Accordingly, the standardized values
of11H are equal to 0.0; 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.0.
In fig. 7 show the features of the change of indices by age
groups of persons taking into account their gender.

It was found that for both men and women IIH is quite high
at a young age (15-24 years), but with age it significantly
decreases: in men to 0.39 at the age of 75 years and older, and
in women up to 0.33 at the same age. This is due to a decrease
in self-esteem, which is usually overestimated at a young age
and underestimated at an older age. Especially, women have
low self-esteem. Therefore, they have a lower IIH.

ILE, on the other hand, tends to grow. As a result, in men
aged 65-74 years, and in women aged 55-64 years ILE and
IIH, as well as ISH have the same values. ISH is calculated as
the average between IIH and ILE. We believe that such a
combination of macro-level indicators (life expectancy) and
micro-level indicators (individual self-assessment of a
person's state of health, gives the most complete picture of the
state of health and can serve as a starting point for determining
policies to maintain and improve health.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
Many countries have been facing the problem of
population aging for more than a decade. This list is updated
every year. Thus, this problem has become global. The causes
of population aging are deformations of the sex-age structure
of the population, a decrease in the birth rate and an increase
in life expectancy.
The study established the role of socio-economic
development in the aging process and their relationship with
the reproduction regime. It is established that there is a
relationship between the level of economic growth and
population aging, although with some exceptions, in particular
for Ukraine. Peculiarities of aging by sex are revealed. It is
determined that in Ukraine there is a significant differentiation
in the aging rates between men and women, which is
associated with high mortality rates among men.
In the conditions of aging it is important to ensure a
healthy old age. The realities of today, during the COVID-19
pandemic, have shown that the most vulnerable and
vulnerable are the elderly. In Ukraine, the mortality rate of the
population aged 65 and over remains one of the highest in
Europe, especially mortality due to diseases of the circulatory
system. According to the results of the author's research, the
structure of the prevalence of diseases among the elderly
includes diseases of the circulatory system, diseases of the
digestive system, musculoskeletal system and connective
tissue.
Sociological research has identified determinants that
largely determine the health of the elderly population. The
chance assessment method found that the chances of having a
chronic disease of the circulatory system increase with
declining socio-economic status, among divorced (widowed)
and smokers.
The main task of the health care system in aging is a
systematic and comprehensive approach, should cover all
periods of life and is relevant not only for those who are
currently healthy.

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objectives: This study aimed to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of contraceptive methods self-
reported by men in England, over 5 years, focusing on condoms in comparison to any male method;
and (2) explore condom as a contraceptive method by region and ethnicity.
Study design: Data were from the Sexual and Reproductive Health Services (Contraception) England
census data set from 2014/15 to 2018/19. Once missing data were removed, this left a total of 365,292
men. Two binomial logistic regression models were performed. Model 1 examined ethnicity, region, and
time on condom as a method of contraception; and Model 2 examined ethnicity, region, and time by any
male contraceptive. Descriptive statistics were run for natural family planning and spermicide.
Results: Model 1 revealed a significant model, 12 (15) = 30,976, P < 0.001, and predicted that condoms as
a method decreased in London with a greater decrease in Midlands. London saw the lowest rate of
decline among the non-White ethnic group, whereas North and South regions increased probability over
time. The North started at a higher probability and the South at the lowest. Model 2 also revealed a
significant model, 12 (15) = 32,472, P < 0.001, with a similar pattern to Model 1. Contingency tables
showed natural family planning and spermicide were the least reported methods and decreased over
time.
Conclusions: As any male contraceptive method appears to be decreasing in both models, reproductive
health promotion is required. This study has implications for commissioning funds and for identifying
regional areas of further investigation.

tries have already reported success engaging men. For example,
research in Malawi suggests that increased communication among
couples is mediated by an increase in knowledge and a decrease in
male opposition within the couple; this is described as an essential
part of the intervention's success. Despite the United Kingdom
having a history of providing aid for family planning to low- and

middle-income countries for targeted programming, albeit this aid
has recently been cut, the United Kingdom has invested very little
funding into research on their own men's family planning practices,
including men's use of condoms for contraception, natural family
planning, or spermicide as a method of contraception, leaving little
understanding of men and contraception. There is now a public
health movement beginning in the United Kingdom for men to
'responsibly ejaculate', or in other words take primary re-
sponsibility for contraception, for which there are currently bar-
riers. The literature suggests there is a need to further understand
men's choice of contraception to be effective with increasing up-
take and overcoming barriers to primary responsibility. However,
before we can begin to overcome barriers, we must start with more
effective data collection techniques and advanced analysis in pub-
lished reports to guide decision-making. For a more in-depth re-
view of the literature, see Supplemental Materials.

Aims and exploration
5
This study objective was to build upon the research of Pearson
and Pearson and Clarke using the same source of national data sets
to understand condoms, natural family planning, and spermicide as
a contraceptive method of men, by region, in England, over 5 years
(from 2014 to 2019). The data sets available from the National
Health System (NHS) clinics have some identified limitations by
Pearson and Pearson and Clarke, for example, the data set lacked
complete demographic information on men such as age (although
age was recorded for women). Furthermore, the data were un-
available on men who attend for family planning purposes as part
of a couple because the patient in a couple was recorded to be the
woman partner. However, some limited information was provided
regarding the ethnic background of men; again little is currently
known about how ethnic background informs contraceptive
method reported among men in the United Kingdom. Therefore,
the second objective of this study was to then explore ethnicity and
contraceptive as a method by men in England. It is to the authors'
knowledge the first study to begin to understand condom as a
method by region over time. It is also the first study to look at
natural family planning and spermicide as a method of contra-
ception by men in England.
Method
The study was a secondary analysis of data from the NHS Con-
traceptive Services-England, Community contraceptive services;
therefore, according to the University Ethics Committee, this study
was exempt from ethical approval as the data are in the public
domain. The primary focus of the data is contraceptive care, and the
variable for condoms is labeled by NHS Digital as 'contraceptive
method' and implies that the data collected is for family planning
purposes. Therefore, it is assumed that the data collected is on
condoms for contraceptive purposes. The census is run on a yearly
basis from April 1 to March 31 each year and is considered the most
comprehensive sexual and reproductive service information
resource for the United Kingdom. The non-disclosive data set
census used for this study included 2014/2015,8 2015/2016,9 2016/
2017,10 2017/2018,11 and 2018/2019.12 The cutoff year was 2019, as
these data were collected before the COVID-19 pandemic, which
13
has affected those men who use contraceptive clinics and would
not make for a meaningful comparison at this stage. A total of
997,665 men participated in the national census from 2014 to 2019.
The data points are entered by the service provider, which includes
8,14
national, regional, and local authorities.
Previous research sug-
gests this is predominantly nurse practitioners in the United
15
Kingdom.
Data set characteristics
The female participants were removed from the data set using
an excel macro to ensure only male responses were used. Similar to
Pearson and Pearson and Clarke, there was only one classification
value for males ("H Male - all ages"), and all observations matching
this value comprised the overall dataset (N — 997,665). A robust
sample was an essential part of the inclusion criteria, and the
sample consists of data only from the regions of England (North,
Midlands, London, and South; for a map of these regions, see Office
for National Statistics ONS Geography16). The rationale for
excluding responses outside of England is that there was not
enough data collected over the 5 years on participants from
Northern Ireland (n 12), Scotland (n 45), and Wales (n 923) to
warrant inclusion in the analyses. However, while limited to En-
gland, participants did not have to be British nationals to be
111
Public Health 219 (2023) 110-116
included as participants; foreign nationals could present at services
and were recorded as part of the data set (although nationality was
not recorded). The remaining men's contraceptive method was
either not recorded or they were using no contraceptive at all
(potentially reliant on female methods), but exactly how many men
fell into these subgroups was not clear within the data set. Once
missing data on contraceptive method was removed from the data
set, there was a total of 365,292 men's data left to analyze. With
speculation that some of the 632,373 excluded, with missing data,
may have been using the service for sexual health not contracep-
tion; however without better data collection methods, this could
not be confirmed. Method as a variable meant the patient reported
what their method of contraception was to the clinician. To create
the contraceptive method variable, the main method, secondary
method, and third method were combined into one variable to
measure any method of contraception. It did not mean that the
method of contraception was given to the participant or used by
15
them in practice. Therefore, this data set then looked at self-
reported methods of contraception, not contraceptive use. Each
year's data were initially combined into a singular data set, with
filtering then occurring for each year's data to provide a view of
self-reported contraceptive methods over time.
Analytic techniques
Two binomial logistic regression models were performed. The
first model examined the effect of ethnicity, region, and time on
condom as a method of contraception. The second model examined
the effect of ethnicity, region, and time on any contraceptive as a
method in comparison to no contraceptive method. All P values
reported were two tailed. Furthermore, two contingency tables
were performed to understand both natural family planning (not
defined in the data set) by ethnicity, region, and time, as well as for
spermicide by ethnicity, region, and time. R studio was used to
analyze the data. All statistical analyses were conducted using
17
packages in the R statistical environment version 3.5.0.
"Pack-
ages" in the R statistical environment refers to additional modules
within R that allow specific analyses to be conducted. All the data
18
were prepared using the R-package dplyr.
Results
Sociodemographics
The number of males per year were 114,027; 85,997; 67,889;
52,593; and 44,786; from 2014 to 2019. This shows a steady
decrease from 2014 to 2019, with the number of men attending
contraceptive services reduced by more than half. In the overall
data set, 258,868 were White and 106,424 were non-White. The
responses for the ethnic group not known/stated were filtered from
the data set because of the lack of clarity whether this was missing
data or the participant refused to answer the question. For any
method of contraception, overall, 299,007 men reported condom as
a main method of contraceptive, 2,684 reported natural family
planning, 159 reported spermicide, and 63,442 men did not report a
main contraceptive method. Overall, 76.6% (n 279,702) of men
were recorded as using the clinic as their main contact, 74.2%
(n 271, 194) were contacting the clinic for the first time, 54.7% of
men attended a primary healthcare center (n — 199, 944), with the
majority (58%) choosing to maintain their current contraceptive
method (n 211,869). It is acknowledged that 70.9% (n 236,455)
of men received both contraception and sexual health advice,
suggesting they may choose condoms for dual protection (contra-
ception and sexually transmitted infections [STIs]). However,
whether the sexual health advice was sought by the men or

whether condoms were chosen for dual protection or for non-
contraceptive use cannot be distinguished in the data collected.
While 74.2% of men in this study reported that it was their first
contact for their contraceptive method, 28.5% of men reported that
it was not their first contact and they were maintaining their cur-
rent contraceptive method. Patient identification numbers are used
for every visit to ensure accurate reporting, such as ensuring mul-
tiple visits are accurately recorded, but these identification
numbers are not shared as part of the data set for confidentiality

first and second contacts for contraceptive method, as it could not
be determined when the men first accessed the service, although
this may bias the data set. The frequency and percentages for the
overall data set by demographic category can be found in Table 1.
Model 1: Ethnicity, region, year, and condom as a method
The model used simultaneous forced entry of the variables and
dummy coding of the ethnicity and region variable, with those of
White ethnicity and the North region treated as the reference
2
values, respectively. This resulted in a significant model,
(15) — 30,976; P < 0.001 (see Table 2
for parameter estimates,
standard errors, and P values).
The model revealed that when compared with those in the
North region, condom as a method for those of White ethnicity in
the South region had a significantly lower log-odds of method at
year O (2014—2015). Those of White ethnicity in the London region
had significantly higher log-odds and those of White ethnicity in
the Midlands region had no significant difference compared with
those of White ethnicity in the North region. Furthermore, those of
non-White ethnicity had a higher log-odds of using condom as a
method at year O when compared with those of non-White
ethnicity in the North region. The log-odds of condom as a
method for those of non-White ethnicity at year 0 were lower in the
South and London regions but higher in the Midlands region in
comparison to those of non-White ethnicity in the Midlands (see
for parameter estimates, standard errors, and P values).
Table 2
The model also revealed that the log-odds of condom as a
method increased over time for those of White ethnicity in the
North region. This increase was of a larger magnitude in the South
region, but there was a decrease over time in log-odds of the
method in the Midlands and London regions. Those of non-White
ethnicity in the North region had no significant difference
compared with those of White ethnicity in the North region in log-
odds of condom as a method over time. Compared with the log-
odds of condom as a method of those of non-White ethnicity in
the North region, there was an increase in log-odds over time for
those of non-White ethnicity in the London region. However, there
was no significant difference in log-odds of condom as a method for
those of non-White ethnicity over time in the Midlands and South
regions when compared with the log-odds of the method for non-
White ethnicities in the North.
Overall, the model shows that the predicted probability of
condom as a method of contraception for non-White and White
ethnicities decreased in the London and Midlands regions over
time, and this decrease was at a greater rate in the Midlands region.
The rate of decrease over time was slower for non-White ethnicities
in the London region. The North and South regions had an increase
in predicted probability of condom as a method over time, but the
North started as a high predicted probability of the method and the
absolute change is not large in magnitude. In contrast, the South
started with lowest predicted probability of condom as a method
than all other regions but had the highest rate of increase. White
ethnicities had a lower predicted probability of the method across
all time points, for all regions.

comparison to those of non-White ethnicity in the Midlands.
The model also revealed that the log-odds of any method
increased over time for those of White ethnicity in the North re-
gion. This increase was of a larger magnitude in the South region,
but there was decrease over time in log-odds of the method in the
Midlands and London regions. Those of non-White ethnicity in the
North region had no significant difference compared with those of
White ethnicity in the North region in log-odds of any contracep-
tive method over time. Compared with the log-odds of any con-
traceptive method of those of non-White ethnicity in the North
region, there was a decrease in log-odds over time for those of non-
White ethnicity in the London region and an increase in log-odds of
the method over time for those of non-White ethnicity in the South
region. However, there was no significant difference in log-odds of
contraceptive method for those of non-White ethnicity over time in

ceptive method for non-White ethnicities in the North.
Overall, the self-report of any contraceptive method model
shows a similar pattern to that for condom as a method of
contraception. The predicted probability of any contraceptive as a
method of contraception for non-White and White ethnicities
decreased in the London and Midlands regions over time, and this
decrease was at a greater rate in the Midlands region. The rate of
decrease over time was slower for non-White ethnicities in the
London region. The North and South regions had an increase in
predicted probability of any contraceptive method over time, but
the North started as a high predicted probability of a contraceptive
method and the absolute change is not large in magnitude. In
contrast, the South started with lowest predicted probability of any

Discussion
Principal findings
In summary, the results from our study show that the Midlands
of England have the lowest rates of condom as a main method of
contraception, followed by men in London. The North and South of
England showed slight increases in condoms and other male con-
traceptives. Irrespective of year, the White ethnic group self-report
condoms as a method of contraception less than the non-White
ethnic group. For the White ethnic group, the odds of self-
reporting condoms as a contraceptive method decreased yearly in
the Midlands and London regions, but the North and South regions
increased yearly. Comparatively, the overall pattern was almost
identical in the non-White ethnic group, although at higher odds of
condoms as a contraceptive method across all regions at all time
points. However, a key difference between ethnicities was seen in
the London region where the White ethnic group decreased over
time at a significantly greater rate. Model 2 predicted the self-
report of any male contraceptive method and showed a similar
pattern to Model 1, where any male method was decreasing and
uptake was less among men who identified as White than men who
did not identify as White. Any male contraceptive method included
condoms, natural family planning, and spermicide. A comparison
was run to understand if the decrease in condoms could be
explained by an increase in other male methods. The results sug-
gest that the decrease in condoms cannot be explained by an in-
crease in any male method. Furthermore, the White ethnic group
did not self-report any form of male method at a higher rate than
the non-White ethnic group.
rate of increase. White ethnicities had a lower predicted probability
of any contraceptive method across all time points, for all regions.
However, in the South and North regions, the probabilities appear
to be on a converging path.

Methodological implications of ethnicity as a variable
Ethnicity is an irrational variable; in the data set, it has been
oversimplified and service users are limited to choose from three
categories, 'White', 'non-White' and 'other/unknown'. This creates a
binary other, 'White' vs 'non-White'. This approach is an essentialist
view of ethnic background that problematically stereotypes groups
19
as having one true identity that is biological driven. Instead,
research suggests that the option should be provided to service users
to self-identify, as well as providing the ability to give non-standard
responses for the complexity of the variable to be explored and new
constructions of ethnic categories to emerge without stigmatization
20
and discrimination.
Furthermore, by taking a homogenous
approach to the 'White' ethnic group, this ignores other groups that
face disadvantage such as White Irish individuals residing in En-
21
gland. While ethnicity is commonly characterized in a problematic
way of race, by using skin color, the relationship between ethno-
cultural group and sexual behavior is important when developing
22
health-based interventions.
For example, research on Black
Caribbean and Black African heterosexual men show differences in
23
health care utilization and prognosis for sexual health and STIs.
Individuals from mixed racial backgrounds also have differences in
sexual health behaviors; for example, risk taking among heterosex-
ual sexual health clinic service users was highest among Black/mixed
Caribbean heterosexual men, with this group being most likely to
24
test positive for STIs. These studies show how further ethnic
categorization within a subgroup such as Black and mixed ethnic
backgrounds could be beneficial to better understand how culture
informs condoms for reproductive purposes. They suggest that for
the purpose of interventions, both social and cultural identities
25
cannot be isolated from the public health approach. Overall, there
is a need to provide a more precise understanding of ethnic identity
26
for the purpose of data collection. Owing to the barriers with
ethnic grouping, very little can be generalized from the data set, but
the model does show that ethnicity and condoms as a method for
contraception are a point requiring further enquiry.
Research implications
What the above critical lens suggests is this study's regional
information would be helpful not only to target certain regions for
interventions but also to tailor the interventions to each region
differently. Historically and currently, there is no published record
of an intervention around improving the use of condoms by men
for contraceptive purposes in England. Any larger intervention or
randomized control trial should focus on clinics from all four re-
gions to account for variations in condoms as a method of contra-
ception or focus on the Midlands to understand why condoms are
reported less for contraception in this region to aim to improve
condom uptake over time. For a discussion of natural family plan-
ning and spermicide as well as recommendations for the NHS, see
Supplemental Materials.
Strengths and limitations
The strength of this study is it provides the first insight into
research on men who live in England's self-reported method of
contraception for condoms, natural family planning, and spermicide.
Future research is also needed on male contraceptive methods
because this census data was unable to capture use, only self-reports
of a method. Both the models on condoms and any contraceptive
were significant at the 0.001 level, suggesting the models are a good
fit. The limitations of the study included that the data were not
collected by the research team; therefore, there was little that could
be done to influence the variables available for analysis.
Public Health 219 (2023) 110-116
Furthermore, although the focus is stated by NHS Digital to be pri-
marily on contraceptive care, and the variable is labeled as such in all
data sets, the three types of men using this service (contraceptive,
sexual health, both) cannot be determined. Dividing the three data
points in future data collection is important before any causation can
be determined, as it would be advantageous, even in this data set, to
know whether when separated if the three groups decreased or
increased their choice of contraceptives respectively to better inform
targeted services and programs. In addition, NHS Digital should add
variables to the data on sexual and reproductive care activity to
include divisions between 'sexual health advice sought' and 'sexual
health advice provided'. This division could be a quality check for if
men were using condoms for contraception, sexual health, or both
purposes, which cannot be determined or quality checked in the
census currently. Also, in this study, a comparison was run to see if
the decrease in condoms could be accounted for by other male
contraceptive methods increasing. In the future, to address the issue
in this study of causation, it would be key to have a balanced sample
of men using each of the male methods for an in-depth comparison.
With a more extensive set of sociodemographic variables for men,
greater understanding can be applied, including possible explana-
tions and implications for clinicians and policymakers. For further
limitations, see the NHS data quality statements publicly available
online by following the citations for the data sets. For example, the
data lack representation where a male patient contacts an outpatient
clinic, a General Practice, a community pharmacist, or a retail setting
reporting condoms as a contraceptive method. Including both men
who made first contact for their method of contraception and men
for whom it was not their first contact, that they were maintaining
their method, did not influence the trends of the regression models
in this study but could have biased the results. This was because the
sample of men maintaining was too small to change the analysis
outcome or to make a meaningful comparison, but it could have
implications in a larger data set, and seeking a balanced data set is
important for making conclusions and comparisons in the future
research. The data set was limited in reporting patient identification
methods, and the NHS Digital should devise a system to reduce
duplicate data points in the data sets and to allow for longitudinal
analysis. Finally, if the individual is <13 or >54 years, their data are
also not included, which is problematic as they may have a method
of contraception at this age.
Conclusion
In all, this is the first study to take a comprehensive overview of
several contraceptive methods, including condoms, natural family
planning, and spermicide, all male methods. The results from the
regression models predict which regions and which ethnic groups
are more likely to report condoms as a method of contraception and
which groups report any male contraceptive method. These models
are helpful to begin to explore differences between regions to inform
commissioning and determined that the decrease in condoms is not
explained by an increase of any male method. Several important
targeted approaches toward data collection have been suggested to
improve our understanding of men's contraceptive methods in En-
gland, with health promotion and policy makers requiring more
evidence-based research to inform messages, commissioning, and
policies when aiming to engage men in family planning behaviors.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background: Increased efforts have focused on reducing maternal morbidity and mortality in the United
States (US). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, very advanced
maternal age, and grand multiparity are known contributors to various maternal morbidities, as well as
maternal mortality. We aimed to evaluate the trends in these risk factors/complications among US pregnan-
Cies during the last three decades (1989—2018).
Methods: This is a retrospective study based on the CDC natality database. We calculated the annual preva-
lence of each risk factor/complication from 1989 to 2018. Joinpoint regression analysis was then used to eval-
uate the trends. Annual percentage changes (APC) were calculated for each of the segments identified by the
joinpoint regression, and average annual percentage changes (AAPC) were calculated for the entire period.
Relative risks (RR) comparing the prevalence of each risk factor/complication in 2018 to its prevalence in
1989 were also calculated. Subsequent analyses evaluated the trends of the main risk factors/complications
by maternal age groups. Statistical significance was determined at p<0-05, and results were presented with
95% confidence intervals.
Findings: Between 1989 and 2018, the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increased by 149%
(AAPC 3-2, 95% CI 2-6—3-8), that of chronic hypertension increased by 182% (AAPC 3-7, 95% CI 3-3—42), that
of diabetes mellitus increased by 261% (AAPC 4-6, 95% CI 4-0—5-2), that of very advanced maternal age
increased by 194% (AAPC 3-8, 95% CI 3-6—4-0), and that of grand multiparity increased by 33% (AAPC 1-0, 95%
CI 0-8—1-2). Chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus increased mostly during the past two decades, while
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and grand multiparity increased primarily over the most recent decade.
Additionally, women of very advanced maternal age had significantly higher rates of hypertensive disorders
of pregnancy, chronic hypertension and diabetes mellitus throughout our study period.
Interpretation: Our study shows a marked increase in the prevalence of five pregnancy risk factors/complica-
tions over the past three decades (1989—2018). This may point to a significant deterioration in the health of
US pregnant women, which potentially contributes to both maternal morbidity and mortality.

Maternal mortality rates in the United States (US) have more than
doubled during the past three decades, increasing from 7-9 per
100,000 live births in 1989 to 17-4 per 100,000 live births in 2018
1,21. Significant increases have also been documented throughout
the years in the prevalence of indicators for severe maternal morbid-
ities and pregnancy complications, such as acute renal failure, pulmo-
nary embolism, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute

tomy, and ventilation
[3-51.
It was estimated that severe maternal
morbidities affected more than 50,000 US women in 2014
[51.
The reasons for the increasing trends in maternal morbidity and
mortality are not entirely clear. Changes in the pre-conception health
of pregnant women, trends of delaying childbearing, increased rates
of cesarean deliveries
as well as racial and ethnic disparities
have been suggested as major contributors. Improvements in the
level of surveillance and identification of pregnancy related morbid-
ities and mortalities have also played an important role [2 8,91
In this study, we aim to extend prior research and evaluate the
trends in several major pregnancy risk factors and complications

Evidence before this study
E. Bomstein et al. / EClinicalMedicine 29-30 (2020) 100657
Prior studies have documented increasing rates of hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy, chronic hypertension, diabetes melli-
tus, very advanced maternal age, and grand multiparity among
pregnant women in the United States (US). These studies were
typically limited by either the size of the sampled population or
the length of the time period examined, as well as by the statis-
tical method used to evaluate temporal trends. We searched
PubMed for any article published up to March 1, 2020, referring
to the prevalence and trends in hypertensive disorders of preg-
nancy / pregnancy induced hypertension / gestational hyper-
tension / preeclampsia / eclampsia / chronic hypertension /
diabetes mellitus / pre-gestational diabetes / gestational diabe-
tes / advanced maternal age / maternal age / grand multiparity
and parity.
Added value of this study
We document a marked increase in the prevalence of several
maternal risk factors/complications: hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy, chronic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, very
advanced maternal age, and grand multiparity among the
entire population of US pregnant women over the last 30 years
(1989 to 2018). The added value of this study stems from evalu-
ating these trends on the entire population of US pregnant
women and over such an extended period of time. In addition,
by conducting joinpoint regression analyses, we are able to
illustrate the temporal changes of the trends in each of these
risk factors/complications throughout our 30 year study period.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results point to a significant and continuous deterioration
in the health of US pregnant women over the past three deca-
des, which has been especially prominent during the last
decade. Understanding the trends in maternal risk factors/com-
plications could help identify the potential root causes for the
increasing rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in the US,
as well as target intervention measures to curtail these trends.
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), chronic hypertension
(CH), diabetes mellitus (DM), very advanced maternal age (vAMA),
and grand multiparity (GM) among US gravidas during the three
decade period between 1989 and 2018. Understanding the long-term
trends in these risk factors/complications can potentially help clarify
the underlying reasons for the increasing rates of maternal morbidity
and mortality in the US during this time period
[101.
2. Methods
2.1. Data and risk factor definitions
This is a retrospective cohort study for the 30 year period from
1989 to 2018. Data regarding the annual cases of live births compli-
cated by hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, chronic hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, very advanced maternal age, and grand multipar-
ity, as well as the total number of live births per year, were collected
from the National Center for Health Statistics' natality files. The data
for 1995—2018 were accessed through the Center for Disease Control
and Prevention's (CDC) Wonder system [111. The data for 1989—1994
were collected from the National Vital Statistics Reports
[12]. For
parity, the Wonder system only included data since 2003
[111
, and
data for all prior years were collected from the National Vital Statis-
tics Reports 121. The data include all live births occurring to US resi-
dents within the United States.
Data on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP; defined as
gestational hypertension, mild and severe preeclampsia, eclampsia,
and HELLP syndrome), chronic hypertension (CH), and diabetes mel-
litus (DM; includes pre-gestational type I diabetes, pre-gestational
type II diabetes, and gestational diabetes) are available in the natality
files since 1989, following the implementation of the 1989 revision of
the US Standard Certificate of Live Birth. These data remain compara-
ble throughout the 30-year period until 2018. Very advanced mater-
nal age (vAMA) was identified from data on the age group of the
mother and defined as women who were 40 years or older at the
time of delivery. Grand multiparity (GM) was identified from detailed
parity data and defined as women with at least five live births. For
each risk factor/complication, incomplete records were excluded.
2.2. Statistical analyses
For every year between 1989 and 2018, we calculated the annual
prevalence of HDP, CH, DM, vAMA, and GM as percentages of live
births. Subsequently, we evaluated the temporal trends in each preg-
nancy risk factor/complication by way of joinpoint regression analy-
sis, conducted using the Joinpoint Regression Program, Version
480-1, by the National Cancer Institute. The joinpoint regression
method is used to detect changes in data trends. In our application, it
was set to fit a model of connected straight lines to a logarithmic
transformation of the data. For each potential number of joinpoints
(i.e. points in which the trend changes) between O and 9, the loca-
tions of the joinpoints were determined via the grid method, by cre-
ating a grid of all possible joinpoint locations, fitting a model to each
possibility, and choosing the model with the lowest sum of squared
errors (SSE) [131. Then, the best model, with the optimal number of
joinpoints, was chosen by comparing the models with the different
number of joinpoints and testing whether more joinpoints were sta-
tistically significant. Statistical significance was tested via the permu-
tation method, by running 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations [14 . The
reported results of the model include the locations of the joinpoints,
the annual percentage change (APC) for each segment of the trend
(equal to the year-over-year change in the rate, under the assump-
tion that this change is constant for the segment), and the average
annual percentage change (AAPC) for the full time period (equal to a
weighted average of all of the APCs). In addition, as an alternative
method, Pearson chi-square testing was used to compare the preva-
lence of each risk factor/complication in 2018 to its prevalence in
1989, with results presented as relative risks (RR). This analysis was
conducted using SAS, Version 9-4. In subsequent analyses, we calcu-
lated the proportion of pregnancies in each of six maternal age
groups (under 20 years, 20—24 years, 25—29 years, 30—34 years,
35—39 years, and at or above 40 years of age), as well as the preva-
lence of HDP, CH, and DM among these age groups, for every year
between 1989 and 2018. For every age group, the temporal trends of
HDP, CH, and DM were then evaluated by way of the joinpoint
regression method, as well as by calculating relative risks.
For all tests, statistical significance was determined as a p-value
below 0-05, and results were reported with associated 95% confi-
dence intervals (95% CI).

3. Results
From 1989 to 2018, there were a total of 120,705,674 live births in
the US, with an average of 4023,522 live births per year (ranging from
3791,712 in 2018 to 4316,233 in 2007). Of the births with available
data, 409% were to women with hypertensive disorders of preg-
nancy (HDP), 1-07% were to women with chronic hypertension (CH),
409% were to women with diabetes mellitus (DM), 2-39% were to
women 40 years of age or more (vAMA), and 45% were to grand mul-
tiparous women (GM).
The temporal trends in the prevalence of each of the risk factors/
complications from 1989 to 2018 are displayed in Fig. 1. The segmen-
tation results of the joinpoint regression analyses are presented in
, with dots marking the joinpoints, and the detailed joinpoint
Fig. 2
results are presented in Table 1. Each risk factor/complication has a
different number of joinpoints and therefore a different number of
segments. Relative risks comparing the prevalence of each risk fac-
tor/complication in 2018 to its prevalence in 1989 are also presented
During this 30-year period, the prevalence of HDP

increased by 149% (RR 2-49, 95% Cl 2-47-2-50, p<O.001) with an
AAPC of 3-2 (95% Cl 2-6-3-8, p<O.001), the prevalence of CH
increased by 182% (RR 2-82, 95% Cl 2-78-2-86, p<O.001) with an
AAPC of 3-7 (95% Cl 3-3-4-2, p<O.001), the prevalence of DM
increased by 261% (RR 3-61, 95% Cl 3-58-3-64, p<O.001) with an
AAPC of 46 (95% CI 40—5-2, p<0-001), the prevalence of vAMA
increased by 194% (RR 2-94, 95% Cl 2-91-2-98, p<O.001) with an
AAPC of 38 (95% CI 3-6—40, p<0-001), and the prevalence of GM
increased by 33% (RR 1-33, 95% Cl 132-1-34, p<O.001 ) with an AAPC
of 1 .O (95% Cl 0-8-1-2, p<O.001 ).
Notably, however, there were many changes in the behavior of
the temporal trends throughout the years. The prevalence of HDP
increased consistently in the 1990s, plateaued
increased rapidly since then, and especially since 2014 (2014—2018
APC: 88, p<0-001 ). The prevalence of CH increased only slightly dur-
ing the 1990s, but has been increasing continuously since 1999, with
an especially high APC since 2016 (2016-2018 APC: 9-7, p<O.001).
The prevalence of DM increased significantly in the early 1990s, sta-
bilized until 1998, and has since then been growing exponentially,
albeit at a slightly lower APC since 2012 (2012—2018 APC: 46,
p<0-001). The prevalence of vAMA increased consistently during the
1990s through 2004, with an especially high APC in the 1989—1997
period (APC: 7-8, 13<0-001), and then stabilized and increased alter-
nately, every 3—5 years, eventually continuing to increase since 2015
(2015—2018 APC: 35, p<0-001). The prevalence of GM increased
between 1989 and 1992, then decreased slightly and stabilized,
before continuing to increase between 1999 and 2018, with a higher
APC since 2006 (2006-2018 APC: 1-8, p<O.001 ).
The distribution of live births across the age groups of the mother,
as displayed in
, changed significantly from 1989 to 2018. Nota-
Fig. 3
bly, the proportion of pregnancies to women at or above the age of
30 increased, while the proportion of pregnancies to women below
the age of 30 decreased. Figs. 4-6 display the trends in HDP, CH, and
DM, respectively, stratified by age group. All age groups exhibited
significant increases in the prevalence of HDP, CH, and DM between
1989 and 2018, but the prevalence of these risk factors/complications
was consistently higher for women with vAMA compared to the
other age groups.
The prevalence of HDP was highest for women at or above the age
of 40. Before 2008, women under the age of 20 had the second high-
est prevalence, but since 2008, the gap between women in the
and 35—39 age groups has reduced. Overall, all age groups exhibited
a similar increasing trend, with a dramatic increase in the prevalence
of HDP since 2008 (Fig. 4
). During the entire 1989—2018 period,
women in the 25—29 and 30—34 age groups exhibited the largest rel-
ative increase in the prevalence of HDP (AAPC 35, 95% CI 2-9—41,
p<O.001, with RR 2-72, 95% Cl 2-68-2-76, p<O.001, and AAPC 3-5,
95% Cl 2-9-4-0, p<O.001, with RR 2-69, 95% Cl 2-65-2-73, p<O.001,

Fig. 2. Joinpoint Regression Analysis of the Trends in the Prevalence of the Pregnancy Risk FactorslComplications:
1989
—2018 — Graphical Presentation. The figure presents the
trends in the prevalence of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), chronic hypertension (CH), diabetes mellitus (DM), very advanced maternal age (vAMA), and grand multi-
parity (GM) among US gravidas, as analyzed via the joinpoint regression method. The dots mark the joinpoints identified by the joinpoint regression, and the lines between the dots
depict the trend in each segment.
Table 1
Joinpoint Regression Analysis of the Trends in the Prevalence of the Pregnancy Risk Factors/Complications: 1989—2018 — Detailed Results The table presents the results of the
joinpoint regression analyses for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), chronic hypertension (CH), diabetes mellitus (DM), very advanced maternal age (vAMA), and
grand multiparity (GM). Each risk factor/complication has a different number of joinpoints and therefore a different number of segments. For each segment, we report the
annual percentage change (APC), and for the entire 1989—2018 period, we report the average annual percentage change (AAPC). Additionally, relative risks (RR) for the entire
period are also presented.

exhibited the lowest relative increase in the prevalence of HDP (AAPC

The prevalence of CH was consistently higher as the age group
increased. Moreover, for all age groups, the prevalence of CH was rel-
atively stable in the 1990s, with slight declines for the and 240
age groups. Since the late 1990s/early 2000s, the prevalence of CH
increased significantly among all age groups, but at varying APCs
(Fig. 5
). Notably, the relative increase in the prevalence of CH
between 1989 and 2018, was substantially lower for the age groups
of 35-39 (AAPC 2-4, 95% Cl 1-9-2-8, p<O.001; RR 1-94, 95% Cl
1-88-2-00, p<O.001) and 240 (AAPC 2-1, 95% Cl 1-8-2-5, p<O.001;
RR 1-66, 95% CI 166—1-76, p<0-001 ), than for the younger age groups
(AAPCs of 3-0-3-7, p<O.001 ; RRs of2-33-2-78, p<O.001 ).
The prevalence of DM was also consistently higher as the age
group increased. Furthermore, for all age groups, after a fast
increase in the beginning of the decade, the prevalence of DM
was relatively stable during the rest of the 1990s, but has
increased dramatically since the late 1990s/early 2000s (Fig. 6)
From 1989 to 2018, the relative prevalence increase was substan-
tially higher for the age group (AAPC 49, 95% CI 41—57,
p<O.001; RR 3-70, 95% Cl 3-54-3-86, p<O.001) and substantially
lower for the 240 age group (AAPC 3-1, 95% CI 2-8—35, p<0-001;
RR 2-55, 95% CI 2-45—2-65, p<0-001), compared to the other
groups (AAPCs of 3-7—42 and RRs of 2-81—3-28). It is notewor-
thy, however, that since 1999 the AAPC (calculated as a weighted
average of the APCs during the partial period) for women in the
240 age group was slightly higher than those for women of age
25 to 39 (AAPC of 46 compared to AAPCs of 3-5—40), and that
during the most recent decade (2008—2018) it was significantly
higher than those for women of age 25 to 39 (AAPC of 46 com-
pared to AAPCs of 3-5—4-0).

4. Discussion
Our study documents dramatic increases in the prevalence of sev-
eral pregnancy risk factors/complications — HDP, CH, DM, vAMA, and
GM — among US pregnant women during the last three decades. For
CH and DM, these increases have primarily occurred since the late
1990s/early 2000s, and for HDP and GM, they were more pronounced
since the mid/late 2000s. Although the trends in HDP, CH, and DM
were observed in all age groups, vAMA women consistently had
higher rates of these risk factors/complications compared to women
in younger age groups. This is especially disturbing, as the proportion
of pregnancies to vAMA women has also grown during this time
period.
Our findings are consistent with several smaller studies that
reported increases in the rates of HDP, CH, DM, vAMA, and GM
among different samples of pregnant women in the US and during

Fig. 6. Trends in the Prevalence ofDM: 1989

different time periods over the past three decades. For example,
Kuklina et al. (2009) used the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (which includes data from
20% of all nonfederal community hospitals in participating states)
and found that the overall prevalence of all hypertensive disorders
among delivery hospitalizations (including both HDP and CH)
increased from 672% in 1998 to 834% in 2006 [31. Using the same
database, Bateman et al. (2012) focused specifically on CH and
reported that the age-adjusted prevalence of CH increased from
1-01% in 1995-1996 to 1-76% in 2007-2008 [15]. With regard to DM,
Lawrence et al. (2008) focused on a sample of women in Southern
California during the period between 1999 and 2005 and docu-
mented increases in the prevalence of pre-existing diabetes from
0-76% to 1-9% and gestational diabetes from 7-1% to 7-8%
[16]. our
results not only confirm these prior findings, but also illustrate the
magnitude of the increases in the prevalence of these risk factors/

complications among the entire US pregnant population. Our results
further show that the increase in the prevalence of all risk factors/
complications continued through 2018. In the last three years alone
(2016—2018), we find a prevalence increase of 27-9% for HDP, 260%
for CH, 166% for DM, 103% for vAMA, and 5-6% for GM. Moreover, by
using one consistent and comparable dataset with 30 years of rele-
vant data, we are able to document the long-term increasing tempo-
ral trends in HDP, CH, DM, vAMA, and GM between 1989 and 2018,
as well as to illustrate the changes in these trends throughout the
years.
The prevalence of HDP increased significantly from 2-88% in 1989
to 7-17% in 2018 (AAPC of 32 and RR of 249). After stabilizing in the
late 1990s/early 2000s, the prevalence of HDP has increased dramati-
cally over the most recent decade in all age groups (Figs. 1-2
and 4
and
Table 1). This is concerning, as HDP is still a major cause of
maternal mortality, responsible for approximately 6-9% of the preg-
nancy-related deaths that occurred between 2011 and 2016
[17-191,
as well as a major contributor to various severe maternal morbidities
3,17
The reasons for the increasing trend in the prevalence of HDP are
not well understood, but prior research has suggested increasing
rates of co-morbidities, such as obesity, chronic hypertension (CH),
diabetes mellitus (DM), advanced maternal age (AMA), and multiple
gestations as potential explanations [
l. However, while we find
10,20
that HDP is indeed more prevalent among vAMA women (Fig. 4
the
long-term trend that we document in HDP behaves quite differently
from the trends of CH, DM, and vAMA (Figs. 1-2 and Table 1). Simi-
larly, it does not correspond to the well-documented long-term con-
tinuous increase in obesity rates among pregnant women
[211.
Therefore, while all of these suggested reasons may contribute to the
increased prevalence of HDP, our results suggest that there may be
additional contributing factors. Further research is needed to explore
these potential factors.
The prevalence of CH rose dramatically since 1999, with an espe-
cially high APC during the last couple of years. Nowadays, CH, which
affected only of pregnant women in the 1990s, has
become significantly more common, with a prevalence of 2-07% in
2018 (
and Table 1). Potential factors that may have contrib-
Figs. 1-2
uted to this increase include increasing rates of obesity and AMA
[151
, and indeed, we find that the prevalence of CH among women
with vAMA was more than double the overall prevalence. Nonethe-
less, higher relative increases in the rates of CH (i.e. higher AAPCs and
RRs) among younger women during the past 30 years have made CH
a noteworthy risk factor even among young women (
Fig. 5
Similarly, the prevalence of DM has more than doubled since the
early 2000s, growing continuously at disturbing rates (Figs. 1-2 and
Table 1). Poor dietary habits, physical inactivity, as well as increasing
rates of obesity and AMA, have been reported as potential contribu-
tors to this increase [10,16 22—25]. General improvements in mater-
nal screening and detection processes, as well as changes in
diagnostic criteria and reporting practices may have also played a
role [
10, Part of the increase that we document can also be
attributed to the 2003 revision of the US Standard Certificate of Live
Birth, which was adopted in a staggered fashion across states until
2016, and has been found to increase the reported rates of DM
l. In any case, in 2018, DM affected 7-61% of pregnant women.
26,27
DM among pregnant women is a known contributor to maternal
morbidity and mortality [27,281. In fact, Nelson et al. (2018) found
that 17% of the increase in maternal mortality rates in the US
between 1997 and 2012 was attributed to the increase in the preva-
lence of DM [271.
Of specific concern is that during the most recent
decade, the prevalence of DM has grown among vAMA women at an
especially high AAPC, so that an astounding 1600% of vAMA women
in 2018 were affected by DM (Fig. 6)
The prevalence of vAMA increased significantly over the last three
decades, and primarily in the 1990s (Figs. 1-2 and Table 1
). In fact,
over the last three decades, the proportion of pregnancies attribut-
able to women in all of the age groups at or above the age of 30
increased, but the most notable increase was for vAMA women
(whose proportion of pregnancies grew threefold, from 1.14% in
). This increase can be explained by the
1989 to 3.35% in 2018; Fig. 3
significant advancement in reproductive therapies during the 1990s
and by the continuous trend of delaying family planning, which can
potentially be attributed to improved access to education and contra-
ception, as well as to an increased focus on the career development
of women
[29-32]
. Prior research has found that women at or above
the age of 40 have higher rates of various pregnancy risk factors and
complications, as well as an increased risk of maternal mortality
8,29—32]. Our findings confirm these results. Specifically, we find
that older women with vAMA consistently had a higher prevalence
of HDP throughout the years (Fig. 4) and that the prevalence of both
CH and DM consistently increased with age, peaking in the vAMA age
group (Figs. 5-6). Nonetheless, our study documents significant
increases in the prevalence of HDP, CH, and DM across all age groups,
and further solidifies their position as major risk factors/complica-
tions among all pregnant women in the US.
The overall increase in the prevalence of GM was relatively mod-
erate during the past three decades, but practically all of this increase
has occurred since 2006. In 2018, 538% of live births were attributed
to grand multiparous women (Figs. 1-2
and
Table 1). The clinical

Background. Despite the enormous advantages of early pregnancy-related problem diagnosis and therapy during prenatal care
Visits, not all pregnant women begin antenatal care at the proper time. Thus, this study aims to identify factors associated with
missed opportunities for antenatal care service utilization among reproductive-age women in Eastern Ethiopia. Methods. A
mixed methods study design (quantitative and qualitative) was conducted in Grawa, Meta, and Haramaya woredas from
September 5 to December 5, 2019. The quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS version 25. A multivariable logistic
regression analysis model was used to identify the predictors. Statistical software programs based on ATLAS.ti version 8.2 was
were used to conduct the thematic analysis of the qualitative data. Results. Overall, missed opportunities for antenatal care
were 15.4% of 95% (12.1, 19.1%). Factors such as maternal age being 15—24 (AOR = 6.9, 95% CI: 2.89—8.81); having a college
education (AOR = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.42), elementary (AOR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.002, 0.98), and secondary education
(AOR= 0.04, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.88); having five and more parity (AOR= 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.75); three visits (AOR = 0.10,
95% CI: 0.02, 0.71); those in the first trimester (AOR = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.35) and the second trimester (AOR = 0.01, 95%
CI: 0.001, 0.26); and get information from a health facility (AOR=O.09, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.67) and traditional birth attendance
(AOR = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.74) were factors statistically associated with outcome variables. Conclusions. According to this
report, relatively high proportions of pregnant women experienced missed opportunities in antenatal care follow-up. Factors
such as maternal age, education, parity, frequency, timing, and media access were statistically significantly correlated with
missed antenatal care follow-up. Therefore, all stakeholders should emphasize advocating for and enhancing the benefits of
antenatal care; this in turn plays a crucial role in increasing the follow-up of clients for these crucial services. Moreover, health
policy implementers need to coordinate their tracking of pregnant women who missed their antenatal care session.
1. Introduction
Globally, an estimated 303 million women died from com-
plications related to pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum
period [1, 2]. Every day, about 830 pregnant women pass
away from curable or preventable pregnancy-related condi-
tions. Among these, ninety-nine percent (822) of women
die in developing countries due to pregnancy and childbirth
[3]. Even though maternal mortality is a global issue, its
major issues are most felt in underdeveloped countries. As
a result, developing nations account for 99 percent of the esti-
mated global number of maternal fatalities, with an estimated
201,000 of those deaths happening in sub-Saharan Africa [4].
Quality antenatal care, accessible obstetrics care, and
life-saving interventions are critical services for reducing
preventable maternal and newborn mortality and morbidity
[5—7]. Bringing the global maternal death rate down to fewer
than 70 per 100,000 live births is a key component of


2
Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.1. [8]. To eliminate
preventable causes of maternal death due to pregnancy-
related complications, existing interventions during preg-
nancy and delivery must be scaled up [7]. Hemorrhage, hyper-
tension, and infection are the leading causes of maternal death
[9, 10]. The most common causes of newborn deaths and
stillbirths are asphyxia, prematurity, and infections, and the
majority are preventable with existing evidence-based inter-
ventions, either directly or indirectly, during pregnancy, labor,
delivery, and postpartum [5, 7, 11, 12].
Despite the fact that universal coverage of antenatal care
services is reported globally and at the country level, many
pregnant women in developing countries do not benefit
from comprehensive antenatal care due to factors such as
late initiation and poor quality of antenatal care services
[13—16]. Early initiation during the first trimester and qual-
ity antenatal care throughout the pregnancy have been
shown to improve pregnancy outcomes and increase new-
born survival [17]. However, in developing countries, only
25% of pregnant women initiated antenatal care before 14
weeks of gestation, and 48% of pregnant women did not
complete four antenatal care visits [14].
Despite the disparities in maternal death rates across
developed and developing countries, studies have demon-
strated that the pattern of maternal mortality and morbidity
has remained constant throughout time. The reasons given
for this include the long-standing custom of having births
at home in risky and unclean settings with untrained or
inadequately qualified delivery attendants [5, 18, 19].
In Ethiopia, the maternal death ratio decreased from
743/100,000 new births in 2005 to 353/100,000 in 2015. This
puts Ethiopian women at a much higher risk than their
counterparts in the developed world, where the risk was esti-
mated to be 1 in 23,700 and 1 in 22,100 in nations like
Greece and Poland, respectively. As a result, the likelihood
of an Ethiopian woman dying from reproductive health dis-
orders and complications was put at 1 in 25 in 2005, 1 in 39
in 2010, and 1 in 64 in 2015 [3, 18].
Despite the government's and numerous stakeholders'
dedication to advocating for and enhancing the benefits of
antenatal care, the prevalence of missed opportunities and
factors influencing them remain unabated. Additionally, to
researchers' knowledge, there is a dearth of published mate-
rial pertaining to missed opportunities and their related
causes in the study region. Furthermore, there is no single
study that employed qualitative methods to dig out the var-
iable under study. As a result, this study assessed the preva-
lence of missed opportunities and associated factors in the
study area.
2. Methods and Materials
2.1. Study Design, Setting, and Period. A mixed methods
study (cross-sectional quantitative method and phenome-
nology qualitative method) was conducted from September
5, 2019, to December 5, 2019, among 422 pregnant women
in Grawa, Meta, and Haramaya woredas. This study site,
namely, Haramaya, Meta, and Grawa, is situated in Eastern
Ethiopia, 526, 423, and 552 kilometers from the capital city
Journal of Pregnancy
of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa. According to data from the wor-
eda health offce in 2015, the populations of the districts
were 291,000, 226,000, and 313,000. Of these, reproductive
age groups account for a total population of 124,470. Most
residents make their living through farming and small-
scale trading (Figure 1).
2.2. Population and Eligibility Criteria. All woreda-dwelling
women of reproductive age who had given birth within the
previous five years of the data gathering were considered
the source population, whereas randomly selected women
using the sampling technique who were available during
the data collection period were regarded as the study popu-
lation. The inclusion criteria were women who were permanent
residents (who lived more than one year in the study area) in
the selected districts and women whose ages were between 15
and 49 years. Women with hearing impairments or communi-
cation impairment conditions, as well as those who were criti-
cally ill, had mental health issues, or had been alive for less
than a year at the time of the interview, were excluded.
2.3. Sample Size Determination and Sampling Procedures.
The sampling size was computed by using a single popula-
tion ratio formula based on the assumption that to get the
largest sample size possible and in light of the lack of prior
prevalence statistics on the population being studied, p was
taken to be 0.5. Additionally, a 95% confidence interval
and a 5% margin of error were established (Z/2 = 1.96)
[20], women aged between 15 and 49 years made up the
majority of the total population (N = 124,470), and a sample
size of 422 women was determined using a 10% contingency
for nonresponse [21].
A three-stage sampling approach was used in this investi-
gation. 30% of the total kebeles in each district were included
in the initial stage. As the number of kebeles varies in the three
districts, proportional sampling to give equal weights was used
[22]. As a result, samples were taken from 39 percent of
kebeles in Grawa, 33 percent in Meta, and 28 percent in
Haramaya [18, 19]. Based on the size of the population, 10
kebeles and 118 HHs from Haramaya, 12 kebeles and 165
HHs from Meta, and 14 kebeles and 139 HHs from Grawa
were selected for the sample of kebeles and homes (HHS). A
lottery technique was used to choose the respondents, with vil-
lages being selected at random [23]. Last but not least, research
subjects took samples from kebeles in the three woredas; a total
of 422 study samples were chosen utilizing a systematic sam-
pling technique. Then, each patient was given a unique code.
The sample size determination and sampling procedures
for antenatal care service utilization and associated factors
for qualitative data included 8 focus group discussants and
32 respondents in a homogenous group (i.e., 4 community
health workers, 8 women in reproductive age, 4 husbands,
4 religious leaders, and 4 community representatives). Addi-
tionally, five mothers-in-law, two sisters, and a father-in-law
of the eight relatives who participated in decision-making
during the birthing process were interviewed [24].
2.4. Data Collection Methods. The open-ended question-
naire, in-depth interviews, audiovisual materials, focus group

discussions, and field observation were used to gather qualita-
tive information, while an interviewer-administered, pretested
closed-ended structured questionnaire, instruments, behavioral
checklists, and records were used to gather quantitative infor-
mation [25]. Representatives from the district health offce,
health center, and women's affairs participated in in-depth
interviews [26]. Using previously developed interview criteria,
focus groups were done with women of reproductive age, com-
munity and religious leaders, spouses, and mothers-in-law
[22]. It contains sociodemographic and economic characteris-
tics, household-related conditions, healthcare services, and
comorbidity-related characteristics.
Sixteen female data collectors with a minimum of sec-
ondary education and native Afaan Oromo speakers gath-
ered the data. The principal investigator was supervised by
two public health professionals who are familiar with the
study's environment. Three days of training on ethics, tools,
sampling, and data collection techniques was given to data
collectors and supervisors. Daily oversight of the data gath-
ering process was provided, and the data collectors received
prompt feedback [18, 19].
2.5. Variables and Their Measurement. Antenatal care
(ANC) is the proportion of women aged 15 to 49 who gave
birth alive and got prenatal care four or more times within
a specific time period [5].
Missed opportunities in maternal and infant health
research are built on the premise that considerable chances
for enhancing mother and child health have been missed
or might have been avoided and that a better arrangement
and focus on postpartum care will lower maternal morbidity
and death [27].
A traditional birth attendant (TBA) is a person who
assists a mother during prenatal and postpartum care and
who initially acquired her skills by delivering babies herself
or through apprenticeship to other traditional birth atten-
dants [18, 19, 28].
2.6. Data Quality Control. A bilingual expert (Afaan Oromo)
created the questionnaire in English before translating it into
the regional tongues. To guarantee uniformity, it was then
translated back into an English version. The supervisor and
data collectors both got training on the methods and tools for
collecting data. 10% of the study participants took a pretest in
a setting similar to research data collection. Regular oversight
was given by the investigators and skilled research supervisors.
2.7. Data Processing and Analysis. The acquired information
was initially checked for consistency and completeness.
Then, for further analysis, they were cleaned, coded, and
put to EpiData version 3.1. The entered data were trans-
ferred to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive and sum-
mary data were produced and published using frequency
tables and figures. A binary logistic regression model was
created to examine any connections between the indepen-
dent variables and the outcome variable. The fitness of the
model was assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics and
Omnibus testing. A multivariable analysis was used to iden-
tify the real factors that affected the result variables. To
determine whether there was any relationship between the
independent variables, a multicollinearity test was carried
out using the standard error and colinearity statistics. There
were no detectable collinearity effects. With this in mind, the
variance inflation factor (V IF) was 0.951. To ascertain the
strength and direction of the statistical association, the odds
ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were utilized.
At a 0.05 p value, it was determined that both the bivariate
and multivariate analyses were statistically significant.

Atlas.ti version 8.2 is was employed to assess qualitative
data. Theme analysis was used to complete it, analyzing and
interpreting the collected data. After then, other codes were
used to encode the translated data. Each code was split up into
a variety of groupings, which were then grouped into themes.
3. Results
3.1. Socioeconomic and Demographic Characteristics. A total
of 422 study participants between the ages of 15 and 49 par-
ticipated, with a 100% response rate. The mean age of partic-
ipants in the research was 26 years old, with SD ± 6.3. The
majority of the study subjects were married: 324 (76.8%),
and 225 (53.3%) were unable to read and write, whereas hus-
bands were 238 (56.4%) in elementary school. Of almost all
of the participants, three hundred eighty-nine (92.2%) were
Oromo ethnic group, and 385 (91.2%) were Muslims.
Almost 101 (23.9%) of the respondents had a household
family size of one to four (Table 1).
3.2. Pregnancy-, Cultural-, and Behavioral-Related Characteristics.
The mean (±SD) age of the first marriage and first pregnancy
was 25.7 ± (5.7) and 27.4 ± (5.8), respectively. The majority
of study participants, 166 (39.3%), had two to four children,
and more than half, 223 (52.8%), were in the age range
between 25 and 34 years. Regarding adverse pregnancy out-
comes, approximately 393 (93.1%) and 391 (92.7%) women
had a previous history of abortion and stillbirth, respectively.

More than half of the 290 participants (68.7%) were not
planning a pregnancy, and 206 (48.8%) had a history of female
genital mutilation. Regarding decision-making authority,
342 (81.1%) made a joint decision, while the majority of the
respondents 372 (88.2%) of the total study participants had
experienced intimate partner violence, whereas 248 (58.8%)
of the respondents had not received support from their part-
ners (Table 2).
3.3. Proportion of Missed Opportunity of Antenatal Care.
Among 422 study participants, 357 (84.6%) had antenatal
care (ANC) follow-up whereas 65 (15.4%) missed ANC
follow-up (Figure 2).
3.4. Obstetrics and Health Service-Related Variables. The
majority of the women, 357 (84.6%), visited health facilities
at least once for prenatal care, and from the total of 422
responders, 202 (56.6%) made their first booking in the first
trimester, while the remaining participants initiated antena-
tal care (ANC) in the second or third trimester. Additionally,
204 participants (57.1%) had only used ANC services three
times, while 233 respondents (65.3%) received information
about ANC from the health institution, 200 respondents
(56.0%) had to wait between 31 and 60 minutes for services,
and 217 respondents (60.7%) were shown respect by the
medical staff. The majority of the women, 205 of the
respondents (48.6%), did not have access to convenient

transportation from their homes to the nearest health facil-
ity, while 221 respondents (52.4%) received ANC service
from the health center. Three-fourths of the 268 respondents
(75.1%) had started their ANC services because of health
problems. Nonetheless, 208 (58.3%) of the study's partici-
pants lack confidence in medical professionals. The survey
discovered that 266 respondents (74.5%) had received health
education while getting ANC. Regarding privacy, more than
294 respondents (82.4%) stated that their privacy was not
respected during ANC visits (Table 3).
Moreover, the focus group discussion (FGD) participants
strengthened the ideas provided above, and one, a 25-year-
old female focus group discussant, expressed the diffculty of
maintaining privacy and confidentiality. She stated that
the male doctor inserted his fingers into my vagina, and
other nurses stood there looking at him. Perhaps they were
in training. I feel bad seeing that crowd staring at me....
Because there were no curtains and no private room, it was
diffcult to change my clothes and breastfeed the baby after
birth. We can see each other, and others (visitors) can easily
see us.... After the baby is born, one bed for each woman
and private rooms or curtains around the bed to avoid seeing
other women would be more comfortable for all women.
In a similar vein, one participant in FGD said that
when I went to the hospital for an antenatal check-up,
there was a health care provider.... It was not what I had
hoped for before going to the hospital for service. There was
no respectful healthcare provider.... The male doctors were
there to perform examinations. The doctors pressed hard on
my tummy, causing me pain.
Thus, from the above discussion, we conclude that the
way the healthcare providers treat the woman plays a pivotal
role in keeping her on track with ANC.
Furthermore, one of the participants immensely com-
plained about the waiting time in the ANC and said that
we are busy at home with our daily tasks .. ...and when we
go for ANC visits, we are expected to stay at least an hour. We
have a lot of daily activities that we do during this time. As a
result, we are clearly tired of waiting, which leads us to aban-
don follow-up. (A 29-year-old woman)
Journal of Pregnancy
Among the total 422 study participants, 204 (57.1%)
(95% CI: 52.0—62.3) were pregnant women attending ANC
three times, while 19 (5.3%) (95% CI: 3.1—7.8) attended
ANC four or more times (Figure 3).
3.5. Missed Opportunity and Associated Factors. In the
bivariable analysis, predictor variables such as maternal
age, educational status, occupational status, family size, age
at first marriage, parity, number of stillbirths, intention to
conceive, frequency of ANC visits, timing of ANC, and
source of information about ANC were significantly associ-
ated with antenatal care service utilization. However, in the
final model of multivariable logistic regression analysis, pre-
dictor variables like those women in the age range of 15—24
years, who are unable to read and write, elementary and sec-
ondary education status, parity one, have three round visits,
being in the first and second trimesters, and those who heard
information from radio, TV, and TBA were significantly
associated with ANC utilization.
Accordingly, respondents in the age range of 15—24 years
were 6.9 times more likely to miss the opportunity of ANC
than those women in the age range of 35—49 years
(AOR = 6.90, 95% CI: 2.89, 8.81). Likewise, women who
were in college and in elementary and secondary education
were 98.1%, 95.2%, and 96.5% less likely to miss the ANC
service than those who had no education or were unable
to read and write (AOR = 0.019, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.421;
AOR=O.048, 95% Cl: 0.002, 0.984; and AOR=O.035,
95% CI: 0.001, 0.882, respectively). Moreover, those study
participants who had more than five parities were 92% less
likely to miss ANC services as compared to those who had
one parity (AOR = 0.081, 95% CI: 0.009, 0.751). Likewise,
those study participants who had three or more visits to
ANC were 89.7% less likely to miss ANC services than those
who had one visit (AOR 0.103, 95% CI: 0.015, 0.711).
Furthermore, the odds of missing ANC services for preg-
nant women who came for ANC follow-up during the first
and second trimesters were 98% and 99% less likely as com-
pared to their counterparts (AOR = 0.020, 95% CI: 0.001,
0.346, and AOR = 0.012, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.260, respectively).
Likewise, the study participants who heard information
from TV, radio, and TBA were 91% and 98% less likely to
miss ANC services than those who heard from other sources
(AOR = 0.092, 95% Cl: 0.013, 0.671, and AOR = 0.022, 95%
Cl: 0.001, 0.743) (Table 4).
4. Discussions
This study assessed the missed opportunity of antenatal care
services and associated factors among reproductive age
women in Haramaya, Chelenko, and Grawa districts, East-
ern Ethiopia. This study pointed out that 15.4% (95% CI:
12.1%, 19.1%) of study participants missed out on antenatal
care services. Thus, more than four out of every five preg-
nant women utilized antenatal care services. Factors such
as those who are women in the age range of 15—24 years,
unable to read and write, elementary and secondary educa-
tion status, those who have one parity, those who have three
round visits, being in the first and second trimesters, those

According to this study, 15.4% of study participants
missed the opportunity for antenatal care services. This is
in harmony with a study conducted in different settings,
such as Kenya (12%) and Malawi (15%) [29]; Holeta Town,
Central Ethiopia (13%) [24]; Northwest Tanzania (13%)
[30]; Tigray Region (18%) [31]; and Hadiya Zone (14%)
[32]. However, the prevalence of missed opportunities in
the current study was much lower than the previous studies

to the 2011 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey
(EDHS), 76% of women in urban areas used ANC. The com-
parative figures for rural areas and the national level were
26% and 34%, respectively [42]. The possible justification
for these disparities might be attributed to differences in

sample size, methods of assessment, and the time gaps of the
study period. Another possible explanation is that the study
population has lower access to information on maternal
healthcare services, of which ANC is one of the vital compo-
nents. In contrast to this, the findings from this study are rel-
atively higher than those from studies conducted in different
settings, such as Jimma Town (10%) [43]. The possible dif-
ference may be due to the fact that East Ethiopia has a higher
level of ANC use, which may be due to the fact that the area
was a cash crop area of Ethiopia and could have better
opportunities for information and better access to health
institutions than the other areas. In addition, seasonal vari-
ability when the studies were conducted could explain the
observed difference among the findings.
Findings from this study pointed out that the age of
women was a significant predictor of outcome variables.
Thus, women in the age range of 15—24 were 6.90 times
more likely to miss ANC opportunities than women in the
age range of 35 and above. This is consistent with the study
conducted in Kenya, Malawi, and Ghana [29]. It is crystal
clear that this cohort of the population is youth and adoles-
cents. Hence, much has to be expected to enhance their con-
cerns and complaints related to those of the ANC, which in
turn plays a crucial role in reversing their absence from ANC
services. Furthermore, this is partially explained by the fact
that women in age groups above 35 were more adapted to
and integrated into the services than their counterparts.
The results of our research demonstrate that ANC
services were used more frequently as maternal education
levels increased. This result is conceivable because increased
education will give women a greater understanding of and
awareness of ANC services. Furthermore, self-independence,
confident decision-making, and capability for managing
household and health all increased with better educational
levels [44, 45]. Findings show that respondents who were
unable to read and write in elementary and secondary
education were 98.1%, 95.2%, and 96.5% more likely to miss
ANC service than those who had college and above. The odds
of missing an antenatal care service were reduced when educa-
tional status increased. This finding was supported by previous
research in Southern Ethiopia [43], Northwest Ethiopia [46,
47], and Western Ethiopia [48]; a systematic review conducted
in Ethiopia [49]; and EDS carried out in rural Ethiopia [35,
50], Kenya [51], Guinea [52, 53], Afghanistan [40], Angola
Journal of Pregnancy
[54], East African countries [55], India [56, 57], Nepal [58],
and Nigeria [59]. Educated women might be empowered to
get services [60—65], and education makes women have
decision-making skills [65, 66]. On top of this, educated
women have knowledge of danger signs [66—68]. Educated
women might be aware of the advantages of antenatal care ser-
vices provided at the service delivery points for the fetus and
themselves [34, 69, 70]. Moreover, this may be linked to the
fact that more educated women are aware of the advantages
of using ANC, which enhances maternal and fetal health
through early detection of issues connected to pregnancy
and the receipt of different preventative and health promotion
services. Also, educated women can have access to media out-
lets that promote the importance of prompt ANC commence-
ment and healthcare facilities that offer the treatment.
Contrary to these, illiterate women could not fully appreciate
the value of ANC services for the health and safety of their
unborn fetus because of the lack of knowledge about the pros
and cons of ANC.
The likelihood of utilization of ANC services among
women who had five or more births was 92% less likely to
be missed compared to women who had one birth. This
study is supported by studies conducted in Eastern Ethiopia
[71] and elsewhere in Cambodia [72]. One explanation for
this could be that first-time mothers are more likely than
second- or third-time mothers to be afraid of getting preg-
nant and want to deliver their babies in a hospital [73]. A
study showed that women perceive that the first pregnancy
could bring more risks than subsequent pregnancies, and
they become less attentive when the number of pregnancies
exceeds a certain limit [74]. Furthermore, women who had a
history of giving birth safely would feel they were healthy
and not intend to seek delivery services from health facilities
[75]. In addition, evidence indicates that women who have
many children are less likely to give birth in a healthy insti-
tution [76]. Therefore, community health programs should
consider community awareness creation to improve institu-
tional delivery among women with multipara.
According to the WHO, every expectant mother should go
to at least four antenatal care appointments [5] and give birth
at a health facility with the assistance of a skilled healthcare
provider [35]. According to our study, women who had three
ANC visits were 89.7% less likely to miss ANC services than
who had only one ANC visit. Our findings were consistent
with the research done in Eastern Hararghe [77]. However,
it was less than the results of research carried out in the Tigray
Region [78] and Dembecha District [79] in Ethiopia, as well as
in Nigeria [80]. The probable variations in the supply of high-
quality healthcare services and limited access to transportation
could be the likely causes of the differences.
This research showed that optimal ANC was better as
compared to the findings of previous studies done in
Nekmet, Ethiopia (32.1%) [81], and elsewhere in Kenya
(32%) [82]. The reason for this variation could be the
emphasis given by the government of Ethiopia to improve
maternal health service utilization, considering that it is
one of the exempted services in Ethiopia [83].
Furthermore, this study pointed out that pregnant
women who came for ANC follow-up in the fourth and

second trimesters were found to be important predictors of
outcome variables. Thus, pregnant women who came for
ANC follow-up during the fourth and second trimesters
were 98% and 99% less likely to miss out on ANC services
as compared to their counterparts, respectively. Studies car-
ried out in many contexts, including Gonder, Northwest
Ethiopia, provide support for this study [84], Addis Ababa
[41], and Malawi [85]. The possible justification could be
the fact that pregnant women who came to ANC follow-up
during the second and third trimesters may hugely

understand the benefit of ANC as they are subjected to the
thought that they missed plenty of benefits provided to preg-
nant women. This regression clearly enhances and tightens
the need to be actively involved in the services of the ANC.
Furthermore, because they joined this vital service late in
the pregnancy journey and after experiencing the vital bene-
fits of ANC services, they continue to use it.
Finally, in this study, the source of information for ANC
services was found to be significantly associated with out-
come variables. Hence, the study participants who heard
information from TV, radio, and relatives were 95.4% and
97.9% less likely to use ANC services, respectively. This is
congruent with the results of EDHS conducted in 2016
[86], Amhara [87], Holeta [24], and Addis Ababa [41].
Although a relative or a partner may be a trusted source of
information, there is a chance of the dissemination of biased
information, which in turn affects the utilization of antenatal
care. Moreover, nowadays, people are fed up with main-
stream media, which leads them not to attend the media as
they think that the information disseminated through them
is not reliable.
5. Practical Implications and Future
Research Direction
This investigation made it clear that some of those pregnant
women lost the chance to receive ANC. Therefore, people
who successfully and efficiently received concentrated ANC
visits profited considerably and immensely from the advice
and assistance of healthcare professionals working in the
setup. More significantly, it gave the women practical knowl-
edge about birth preparation, preparing for problems, early
treatment, and spotting concurrent issues. We strongly urge
researchers to employ observational studies to ascertain the
impacts of the missed chance of ANC on the health of mothers
and their babies since we are only worried about the missed
opportunity of ANC rather than its result. Furthermore,
because the study was conducted at the community level,
extrapolating results for those who worked in institutions
would be diffcult, which in turn affected the external validity
of the study.
6. Limitation
The limitation of this study is that it does not address the
qualitative aspects, like the detailed reasons why mothers
missed their antenatal care follow-up. Therefore, it is open
for researchers to conduct a qualitative study on why women
missed their subsequent antenatal care follow-up.
7. Conclusions
This study pointed out that relatively high proportions of
pregnant women experienced missed opportunities in ante-
natal care follow-up. Factors such as those who are women
in the age range of 15—24 years, unable to read and write,
elementary and secondary education status, those who have
one parity, those who have three round visits, being in the
first and second trimesters, those who heard information
Journal of Pregnancy
from a health care provider, and TBA were identified as pre-
dictors of ANC utilization. Therefore, in order to enhance
the uptake of four full visits, health policy implementers
need to coordinate their tracking of pregnant women who
missed their antenatal care session.

Artificial intelligence gives pregnant women another avenue for receiving
healthcare information. With the advancement of information and
communication technology, searching online for pregnancy information has
become commonplace during COVID-19 This study aimed to explore
pregnant women's information-seeking behavior based on data mining and
text analysis in China. Posts on maternal and infant-related websites were
collected during 1 June 2020, and 31 January 2021. A total of 5,53,117 valid posts
were obtained. Based on the data, we performed correlation analysis, topic
analysis, and sentiment analysis. The correlation analysis showed the positive
effects of population, population with a college education or above, and GDP
on post counts. The topic analysis extracted six, nineteen, eighteen, thirteen,
eleven, sixteen, thirteen, sixteen, nineteen, and fourteen topics in different
months of pregnancy, reflecting different information needs in various
pregnancy periods. The results of sentiment analysis show that a peak of the
posts emerged in the second month of pregnancy and the proportion of
emotionally positive posts reached its peak in the sixth month of pregnancy
The study provides important insights for understanding pregnant women's
information-seeking behavior.
KEYWORDS
pregnancy, health information, text analysis, topic analysis, sentiment analysis
1 Introduction
Artificial intelligence (A1) creates opportunities for enabling pregnant women to
receive healthcare information. Pregnancy is a crucial period in a woman's life
accompanied by physical change, psychological change, and role transformation.
Information-seeking can play an important role in addressing the issue of a healthy
delivery. Access to advantageous and concerned information contributes to health-related
decisions and the life of both pregnant women and unborn children (Kamali et al., 2018).
Childbirth-related information is considerable for performing beneficial interventions
and suggestions for pregnant women (Kamali et al., 2018). For example, health-related
information will enable women to prepare for pregnancy, concentrate on balanced
nutrition and medication use during pregnancy, and make decisions on exercise
intensity and mode.

Hou and Hou
Extant research on health information has addressed the
crucial role of research contexts, such as the user group and
the domain of information subject in determining
information needs (Pian et al., 2020; Reifegerste et al.,
2020). The development of information technology and the
spread of the mobile Internet enable pregnant women to seek
information in a more conveniently and fairly way. Centered
on the information needs of maternal health, recent studies
have shown that pregnant women's information-seeking
behavior is crucial to enriching the knowledge of
childbirth and maternal health and improving maternal
health outcomes (Kamali et al., 2018; Ahmadian et al.,
2020; Jin et al., 2020; Kassim, 2021). For example, Kamali
et al. (2018) found that pregnant women need information
such as psychological and physical complications after
delivery and pregnancy nutrition in the descriptive study.
The qualitative study conducted by Kassim (2021) found that
the unavailability of health facilities and limited chances of
accessing professional health care could lead to the results
that pregnant women seek information from non-
professional and informal sources. Ahmadian et al. (2020)
identified commonly searched topics during pregnancy using
the questionnaire. However, researchers have not treated the
topics of information-seeking and pregnant women's
emotions in much detail by employing a relatively large
amount of data.
The objective of this research is to explore pregnant women's
information-seeking behavior during the whole pregnancy,
including the factors that contribute to the information-
seeking behavior, the topics that cause pregnant women's
attention at different months of pregnancy, and the change in
pregnant women's emotions at different stages of pregnancy. By
collecting and analyzing the posts in the "pregnant section"
under "Mama.cn" from 1 June 2020, to 31 January 2021, and
5,53,117 valid posts, the current work provides a comprehensive
study.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Data collection
With the advancement of Internet technology, pregnant
women's behavior of seeking online health information has
become a universal trend worldwide because of insufficient
information received from healthcare providers and the
natural advantage of the Internet to ask questions
anonymously (A1-Dahshan et al., 2021). As one of the
largest maternal and child health websites in China,
"Mama.cn" has integrated websites, APPS, new media,
micro-network celebrities, and other media resources,
covering hundreds of millions of pan-maternal and infant
groups. Dedicated to serving all kinds of needs of pregnant

women, the company has built several service sections
including information, social networking, tools, and
e-commerce, aiming to build a diversified Internet
maternal, and infant service platform with pregnant women
as the core. "Mama.cn" is widely popular among people who
are preparing for pregnancy, during pregnancy, and
childrearing.
2019, "Mama.cn"
had
In August
16.479 million active users. The number of active users of
"Mama.cn" reached 19.31 million in June 2020, ranking first
in the parenting subdivision list in China. Therefore,
"Mama.cn" was selected as the research data source for this
study. This study collected the posts in the "pregnant section"
under "Mama.cn" from 1 June 2020, to 31 January 2021,
involving data from "the first month of pregnancy" to "the
tenth month of pregnancy." The current study extracted the
following information from the "pregnant section" under
"Mama.cn" posts: username, post time, duration of
pregnancy, city, and text. A total of 5,75,970 posts were
obtained. Examples of our dataset are presented in Table l.
We pre-processed the original data before formal analysis by
the following procedures. First, the raw information may include
missing city tags, irrelevant advertising messages, or posts that
did not match the actual time of pregnancy. We filtrated and
deleted the above data and finally obtained 5,53,117 texts.
Second, the original message may contain distracting
information, such as interpunction, emoticons, blank, and
hashtags. For excluding data noise and improving data
analysis efficiency, we employed regular expressions
operations in Python for text filtering.
Measures were performed to ensure data privacy,
anonymity, and security. The data collection and analysis
did not disclose any privacy issues regarding pregnant
women's identifiable and sensitive information (Favaretto
et al., 2020). During data collection, only username, post
time, duration of pregnancy, city, and text were extracted. In
data processing and analysis, only the duration of pregnancy,
city, and text data was used, while the personal information of
users was not disclosed. By involving as many samples as
possible, more anonymity was preserved as a combination of
the variables will be repeated among the samples (Leon-Sanz,
2019).
2.2 Methods
2.2.1 Text topic analysis based on latent
Dirichlet allocation model
LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic model is a topic
probability distribution model based on PLSI (Probabilistic
Latent Semantic Indexing) model (Blei et al., 2003). The LDA
topic model simulates the process of document generation by
using an implied random variable that follows a Dirichlet
distribution to represent the document's topic mixing ratio.

The process of topic extraction.
Its model structure is more complete and clearer, and the
probability inference algorithm is adopted to process the text,
which can greatly reduce the dimension of the text
representation, to avoid dimension disaster (Blei, 2012).
Therefore, LDA is widely used in text mining, text
clustering, language processing, and other aspects. The topic
number K contained in the document set is a hyperparameter.
Given other hyperparameters, the selection process of topic
number K is the process of the model searching for the optimal
topic number. When the number of topics is too large, there
will be many topics without obvious classification semantic
information. When the number of topics is too small, broad
topics will be generated with a mixture of two or more
distributions
(Panichella,
2021). Therefore, the
determination of the optimal number of topics is an
important issue. A coherence score was used to determine
the optimal number of topics, with a higher coherence score
indicating better quality of topics (Korenäé et al., 2018;
Panichella, 2021; Shah et al., 2021). This study used the
open-source LDA tool in the Gensim library. The LDA
model was evaluated by topic coherence to determine the
optimal number of topics. According to the trained LDA
model, the topic words under each topic were obtained and
Frontiers in Physiology

the probability of each text belonging to each topic could be
directly predicted. Finally, the corresponding topic name was
summarized in accordance with the topic words. Figure 1
presents the process of topic extraction in this study.
2.2.2 Text sentiment analysis based on SnowNLP
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in
sentiment analysis (Wang et al., 2019). Sentiment analysis,
also known as opinion mining, is an application of text
mining and computational linguistics to mine subjective texts
with emotional colors and identify the emotional tendencies
contained in them. It is a process of identifying information
from texts and analyzing, processing, induction, and reasoning
subjective texts with emotional color. Through sentiment
analysis, researchers
can determine users
emotional
orientation in the text. Text-based sentiment analysis methods
are mainly divided into three types: sentiment dictionary-based,
machine learning-based, and deep learning-based (Xu et al.,
2019; Li et al., 2020). The machine learning-based analysis
method trains the emotion classifier with emotion-labeled
data to achieve emotion classification. Classification accuracy
relies on high-quality human-annotated training sets, and large-
scale high-quality training data requires a lot of labor costs, and

the results of human subjective data annotation will also affect
the classification effect. The deep learning-based analysis is based
on feature self-learning and deep neural network. It has a good
classification effect when dealing with high-dimensional,
unlabeled big data, but it is difficult to accurately classify the
semantically ambiguous and short text content in social
networks. The sentiment dictionary-based method is an
unsupervised method, which uses a sentiment dictionary to
discriminate the sentiment polarity of text containing
keywords, to achieve sentiment classification for each text.
There is no need for complex data labeling in the research
process and the accuracy of emotion recognition can be
improved by adjusting and expanding the vocabulary of the
sentiment dictionary according to the specific research
background.
SnowNLP, a Python library for Chinese natural language
processing, is used to analyze the sentiment of texts. The tool is
based on a sentiment dictionary to analyze the sentiment
orientation of texts. SnowNLP employs a sentiment dictionary
to realize the sentiment tendency analysis of the text. The main
functions include part-of-speech tagging, sentiment analysis,
keyword extraction, and text summarization (He et al., 2020;
Zhang et al., 2021).
3 Correlation analysis
The correlation analysis is performed using SPSS24.O. The
results of descriptive statistical analysis at the provincial level are
presented in Table 2. The data of posts, population, population

with a college education or above, illiteracy rate, and GDP of the
province are from mainland China. More precisely, population,
population with a college education and above, and illiteracy rate
are all data from the 2020 census.
Table 3 presents the correlation analysis results at the
provincial level. Post counts was found to positively related to
population (ß = 0.889, p < 0.001), population with college
education or above (ß = 0.835, p < 0.001), and GDP (ß —
0.819, p < 0.001). However, a significant relationship between
post counts and illiteracy rate (p > 0.05) was not found in this
study. This result is consistent with previous research which
indicates that the illiteracy rate had a small and insignificant
correlation with computer and Internet penetration rates
statistically (Chinn and Fairlie, 2010).
4 Topic analysis of information needs
4.1 Emerged topics in different months of
pregnancy
4.1.1 Information needs in the first month
As mentioned above, topic analysis was divided based on the
stages of pregnancy, corresponding to the period from "the first
month of pregnancy" to "the tenth month of pregnancy". Table 4
presents the topics identified in the first month of pregnancy,
relative weight, and LDA keywords. Six topics emerged in the
first month of pregnancy in which the first frequent topic. "Test

statistics, word frequency is distributed by font size. As shown in
Figure 2, the fonts of words such as "pregnancy," "child," and
"fetus" are prominent, indicating that the topic of pregnancy is
centered on pregnant women and babies. Secondly, the fonts of
words such as "hospital," "normal," "doctor," and "healthy" are
also clearly displayed, indicating that obstetric examination is an
important topic that pregnant women continue to pay attention
to during pregnancy, which can help pregnant women to keep
abreast of their physical status and fetal upgrowth. Then, words
such as "pain," "belly," "good," "eat," "hungry," "drink," and
"food" appeared frequently, reflecting pregnant women's

concerns about their physical condition and diet during
pregnancy. Words such as "cheer," "hope," "happy," "love,"
"boy," and "girl" reflect pregnant women's good wishes for
their babies and their curiosity about their babies' gender.
5 Sentiment analysis
Sentiment analysis is performed to further understand the
changes in pregnant women's information-seeking behavior
during pregnancy. As discussed earlier, we use

of each post text, and the range of sentiment value results is [O, 1].
Among them, a sentiment with a value greater than 0.5 is
positive, and a sentiment less than or equal to 0.5 is negative.
The closer the value is to 1, the more positive the emotion; the
closer the value is to O, the more negative the emotion. Figure 3
presents the posts with a sentiment value greater than 0.5 in each
pregnancy month.
By combining the outcomes of topic analysis and sentiment
analysis, the results show that in the first month of pregnancy, the
number of posts is relatively small, mainly focusing on topics
such as "test strip" and "pregnancy tests consultation," and the
proportion of emotionally positive posts is also relatively low. On
the one hand, many pregnant women have not found out that
they are pregnant in the first month of pregnancy; on the other
hand, the first month of pregnancy is often unstable and at a loss
for pregnant women, so their emotions are relatively negative.
The number of posts in the second month of pregnancy is the
most, but the proportion of posts with positive emotions is also
relatively low. In the second month of pregnancy, most pregnant
women have already guessed or confirmed pregnancy, but new
pregnant women have little knowledge about pregnancy.
Therefore, posts about "precautions for early pregnancy,"
"early pregnancy inspection," "symptoms of early pregnancy'
and other related early pregnancy topics surged. However, due to
the uncertainty of the baby's status and the lack of relevant
knowledge of pregnant women, the proportion of emotionally
positive posts in the second month of pregnancy is relatively low.
Frontiers in Physiology
11
After the first 2 months of relevant inspections and
understanding of pregnancy knowledge, pregnant women have
entered a relatively mature stage. At the same time, the status of
the baby gradually stabilized, so the number of posts from the
second month of pregnancy to the third month dropped
significantly, and it continued to be stable until the ninth of
pregnancy.
The proportion of emotionally positive posts from the third
month to the ninth month of pregnancy is higher than that in
other months, and there is an upward trend from the third month
to the sixth month of pregnancy. The proportion is the highest in
the sixth month of pregnancy, and then gradually decreases. After
the third month of pregnancy, the baby's state gradually stabilizes,
the pregnant women's belly gradually bulges, and the pregnant
women can even feel the baby's fetal movement, but there is
generally no obvious physical discomfort, so the pregnant women's
emotions are relatively more positive. Since the seventh month of
pregnancy, the baby's weight increases, the pregnant women's
belly increases, the body gradually becomes clumsy, and the body
also has various discomforts such as soreness and difficulty
sleeping, so pregnant women show more negative emotions.
The number of posts in the tenth month of pregnancy surged
again, second only to the second month of pregnancy, and the
proportion of emotionally positive posts also dropped sharply,
only higher than in the first of pregnancy. The tenth month of
pregnancy is the month when the baby is about to be born. On
the one hand, the pregnant women's body aches and sleep

Hou and Hou
problems are more prominent. On the other hand, pregnant
women are faced with the uncertainty of childbirth, and a state of
fear and anxiety appears. It can also be seen from the results of
the topic analysis that in the current month, "appeals and desire"
ranked first among the topics that pregnant women paid
attention to, accounting for 21.17%. In addition, "expected
date of confinement" and "pregnant women's physical
discomfort" are also the main contents of concern for
pregnant women.
6 Discussion and conclusion
6.1 Summary of findings
The purpose of the current study was to investigate pregnant
women's information-seeking behavior. By a combination of
descriptive analysis, topic analysis, and sentiment analysis, the
current work expands our knowledge by proving important
findings. The correlation analysis showed that more pregnant
women contribute to more posts. Moreover, pregnant women
with a college education or above are more likely to seek
information about pregnancy on internet platforms. The more
economically developed cities have higher Internet usage.
Therefore, pregnant women will be more probable to use
Internet platforms to seek information.
Furthermore, the topics from the first month to the tenth
month of pregnancy were extracted in topic analysis. The
findings show that the topics in different months of
pregnancy relate to the present stages of pregnancy. The
current paper identified six, nineteen, eighteen, thirteen,
eleven, sixteen, thirteen, sixteen, nineteen, and fourteen topics
in different months of pregnancy. The specific topics in different
stages show the changes in pregnant women's attention.
In addition, the sentiment analysis showed the variation of
pregnant women's emotions in information-seeking. The results
of sentiment analysis show a peak of the posts in the second
month of pregnancy. The proportion of emotionally positive
posts reached its peak in the sixth month of pregnancy. Pregnant
women's emotional sentiment deeply interacts with the results of
topic analysis.
6.2 Practical and theoretical implications
Our study presents theoretical and practical significance.
First, this is one of the first studies to understand pregnant
women's information-seeking using the methods of data mining
and text analysis. Previous studies on the information needs of
maternal health revealed the topics that pregnant women pay
attention to; however, the existing work is limited in the
descriptive analysis and self-reported questionnaire data
(Kamali et al., 2018; Ahmadian et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2020;
Frontiers in Physiology
12
10.3389/fphys.2022.1038048
Kassim, 2021). This study is unique by employing enormous
quantities of data and the research data covers a long period. By
visualizing the posts of every province, the geographical
distribution of pregnant women's posts was clearly displayed.
The current study enriches our understanding of the
relationships among pregnant women's information-seeking,
regional economic development level, and educational level.
Second, this study provides comprehensive research,
involving abundant analysis. Compared with previous research
(Kamali et al., 2018), the current work divides the data from the
first month of pregnancy to the tenth month of pregnancy and
analyzes the large amounts of data according to the pregnancy
period. This study provides important insights for understanding
the change of emotions during different pregnant stages and
connecting the changes of emotions with the topics that cause
pregnant women's attention. The current work provides the
perspectives for future research by the subdivision of data in
different pregnant stages.
Third, the findings of this study have several practical
implications. The findings indicate that pregnant women pay
attention to different topics during various months of pregnancy.
The maternal and infant-related websites should provide
customized information recommendations for pregnant
women according to their stages of pregnancy. For example,
information such as precautions and inspection for early
pregnancy should be recommended for pregnant women in
the second month of pregnancy. Moreover, the proportion of
emotionally positive posts reached its peak in the sixth month of
pregnancy and is relatively low in the first and the tenth of
pregnancy. The relevant government management departments
and hospitals should concern about anxiety during early
pregnancy and before delivery. The popularization of
knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth would be useful
for improving pregnant women's emotions.
6.3 Limitations and future research
The study is subject to several inevitable limitations. First, the
data source of this study is "Mama.cn" mainly located in China.
What is now needed in the future is a cross-national study
involving data for countries at different levels of development.
The present study lays the groundwork for future research into
pregnant women's information-seeking behavior around the
world. Future studies are encouraged to improve the
generalizability of the current work by involving data from
different countries and understanding the role of cultural
identity in determining pregnant women's information-
seeking. Second, the data such as personal attributes and
specific family environments are not included in the paper
since such data cannot be obtained from the website. It would
be interesting to investigate the effect of family-related variables
on pregnant women's emotional sentiment in future work.

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background: Women receive many public health messages relating to pregnancy which are intended
to improve outcomes for babies and mothers. However, negotiating the risk landscape and maternity
care system can feel confusing and disempowering. Relationships between women and their healthcare
providers are paramount, but they can be adversely affected by issues of trust and autonomy.
Methods: We used a nested study design including an online survey and qualitative interviews to gain
an understanding of women's experiences of risk messages during pregnancy. We purposively sampled
survey participants to ensure the interview population included women whose voices are seldom heard
and are disproportionately impacted by poor risk communication.
Results: A total of 7,009 women responded to the survey, and 34 women participated in interviews. Par-
ticipants received public health and risk messages from a range of sources. Data showed that women
wanted a balance between a "better safe than sorry" approach and evidence-based information and ad-
vice. Women reported a discrepancy between the topics they received a lot of information on and areas
in which they felt they needed more advice. Many participants said they were given conflicting advice,
and the way information was delivered sometimes challenged their autonomy. We identified that younger
women (<20 years old) and women with higher BMIs experienced stigmatisation in their maternity care.
Conclusions: Our research shows the importance of risk communication that respects women's auton-
omy and trusts them to make decisions about their own pregnancy. We identified a need for a layered
approach to risk communication. Whilst some women are happy to adopt precautionary behaviour with-
out discussion, others will want a thorough examination of the evidence-base. Our findings suggest that
more individualised care, continuity, and less judgement and stigmatisation from HCPS will improve ex-
periences for women and may lead to better engagement with services.

Public health messages, or messages about risk regarding be-
haviours during pregnancy, form one aspect of a laudable agenda
to improve pregnancy outcomes and give babies a better start in
life during "the first 1000 days" (First 1000 days of life, 2019).
These messages are based on an understanding that information
and clear direction will lead expectant parents (primarily moth-
ers) to make decisions that reduce the risk to the pregnancy, and
of their babies experiencing short- and longer-term adverse health
outcomes.

Pregnancy is often characterised as a 'teachable moment' dur-
ing which women are receptive to the provision of public health
messages and interventions (Antenatal care, 2021; Atkinson et al.,
). One consequence is that women before and during preg-
2016
nancy, are subjected to a wide range of messages about how to
reduce or manage a multitude of risks. As part of routine ante-
natal care, midwives are expected to provide information on diet,
smoking and substance misuse, weight management, emotional
and mental health, exercise, pre-existing medical conditions, foetal
movements, and pregnancy related symptoms, all in addition to
providing clinical monitoring of the woman and her pregnancy
(Sanders et al., 2016). Family members, friends, and parenting 'ex-
perts' also contribute their own, sometimes contradictory, opinions
and experiences. New study findings introduce an increasing range
of risks and benefits -
from avoiding air pollution (Smith et al.,
2017) to eating more broccoli (Li et al., 2018). These findings are

reported in press statements and media headlines, which do not
always fully reflect the nuances of results, which may create alarm,
or additional pressure for women and the people who care for
them (Marshall et al., 2021)
The volume and intensity of instruction may be leading to un-
intended negative effects
- including excessive maternal anxiety
(Rowe and Fisher, 2015), and a failure to deliver personalised care
that addresses individuals' concerns (Sanders et al., 2016). Further-
more, risks may not always be communicated in a way that reflects
or explains the limitations of the evidence base (Sharp et al., 2018).
Elements of current pregnancy-related public health advice
have been challenged on the basis that they are insuffciently
nuanced. For example, research which sought women's experi-
ences of the UK Governments' guidance to abstain from drink-
ing alcohol in pregnancy, raised concerns about the communica-
tion of the precautionary principle (the 'better safe than sorry' ap-
proach) (
Communicating public health alcohol guidance for expec-
tant mothers 2018). Other concerns highlighted were the risk of
irresolvable anxiety amongst women who had drunk alcohol be-
fore they knew they were pregnant and the encouragement of so-
Cial surveillance of women's decisions. Alarm has also been raised
about the extension of pregnancy risk messaging to all women
of childbearing age, including the recent World Health Organiza-
tion draft recommendation that all women with childbearing po-
tential abstain from drinking alcohol (Global alcohol action plan
). Some suggest that the current risk messaging context may
2022
be driving a wider culture of parenting that tends to hold mothers
responsible for any and all ills that befall their children (Lee and
Bristow, 2020). In some countries, such as the USA, mothers are
held maximally responsible and sometimes imprisoned for be-
haviours that may harm the foetus in utero such as taking illegal,
and even prescription, drugs (Negpor and Csémy, 2016).
We anticipated that the challenges in negotiating risk-messages
disproportionately affect women who have pre-existing or preg-
nancy complications, or who are more vulnerable in other ways.
Women who are taking medications, have higher BMIs, older
or younger than the contemporaneous mean, or those living in
poverty can all find themselves under pressure to change their
behaviour whilst also finding risks more diffcult to avoid. Moth-
ers themselves, and those responsible for their care, sometimes
struggle to balance maternal need for pharmacological treatments
with limiting foetal exposure to (potentially) teratogenic medica-
tions (
Lawthom, 2018). The MBBRACE-UK inquiries have identified
advice to pregnant women to discontinue antidepressants as a con-
tributory factor in maternal suicide, and there are concerns that
restrictions on sodium valproate use amongst women of reproduc-
tive age may result in the deaths of pregnant women with epilepsy
(Knight et al., 2021 ). A failure to prioritise maternal health can also
have grave impacts for a woman's foetus. New research suggests
that 5% of women with Hyperemesis Gravidarum who did not re-
ceive appropriate treatment had an abortion, and over half consid-
ered terminating otherwise wanted pregnancies (Nana et al., 2021 ).
We aimed to gain an in-depth understanding of women's lived
experiences of pregnancy related risk messages and public health
advice across a wide range of topics and issues.
Aims
1) To describe women's lived experiences of risk communication
relating to pregnancy in the United Kingdom and how this
varies for:
a. women with higher BMIs (>30 kg/m2)
b. women who make decisions relating to medications, includ-
ing for Hyperemesis Gravidarum, and for depression or anx-
iety
c. younger women
Midwifery 113 (2022) 103433
2) To describe which aspects or topics relating to risk communi-
cation for pregnancy are problematic for women and why
3) To explore how women experience risk communication in
terms of prioritising foetal and maternal health
4) To explore how women experience the communication of un-
certainty and the precautionary principle as part of risk mes-
saging
Methods
Study design
We used a mixed-methods nested design consisting of an on-
line survey and in-depth interviews with a sub-sample of survey
respondents.
Study population
The study population consisted of women who were pregnant
or who had been pregnant in the last five years. This included
women whose pregnancy ended in a live birth, miscarriage, still-
birth, or termination of pregnancy.
Inclusion criteria:
• Women aged 16-45 years old
• Women who were or had been pregnant within the last 5 years
• Women who were living in the United Kingdom
Exclusion criteria:
• Women with insuffcient English to participate in the online
survey or interviews
The survey and interviews were inclusive of all people who had
been pregnant in the last five years. We use the word women col-
lectively throughout this paper as that is how most participants
self-identify, but refer to individuals using their self-described gen-
der. We use the term "BAME", but acknowledge that this is prob-
lematic and present our data on ethnicity in more granular and
specific terms in

Data collection
Survey
The online survey was developed in collaboration with the
project advisory group.. A pilot of the survey allowed the re-
search team to draw on feedback from users and test dissemina-
tion strategies.
A participant information sheet and consent form were inte-
grated into the survey. The survey included questions on partici-
pants' experience of the advice, information, and support they re-
ceived from different sources during pregnancy, with the focus on
the respondent's most recent pregnancy. Questions with open free-
text responses were included alongside questions with Likert scales
and multiple-choice responses. Data on sociodemographic charac-
teristics were collected. We also asked survey participants whether
they would be prepared to be contacted for a future one-to-one in-
terview.
The survey was hosted on SurveyMonkey (Surveymonkey,
), took approximately 10-15 min to complete, and was open
2022
between 12 June and 7 August 2019. There were 27 questions in
total, although the final 8 questions were focused on participation
in future research including the interviews. Data generated by the
other 19 questions are presented in the results section.
The survey was disseminated through Facebook's inbuilt adver-
tising feature which invited women aged 16-45 years from across
the UK to participate, and through partner organisations that work

We acknowledge the term "BAME" is problematic and present our data on ethnicity in more granular and
specific terms in this table (The Power of Language 2021).
The project was inclusive of all people who had been pregnant in the last five years regardless of their
gender identity. "Other" gender identities included non-binary and gender fluid.

with expectant and new parents. The survey link was shareable
which allowed for snowball sampling (Johnson, 2014).
One-to-one interviews
To gain an in-depth understanding of women's experiences we
also conducted interviews. A sampling frame was designed to en-
sure 20% of the interview sample were eligible for means-tested
State benefits, at least 20% of the sample were from Black, Asian,
and Minority Ethnic (BAME) backgrounds, and included at least six
women with experience of pregnancy advice in relation to:
• having a higher BMI (>30)
• medications for mental health conditions
• medications for Hyperemesis Gravidarum
• being a younger mother (aged at the time of their preg-
nancy)
• having a termination due to a perceived or actual risk either to
themselves or their foetus/baby
Some participants fell into more than one of these categories.
Survey participants that met the sampling criteria were selected
to be contacted using a random number table, until the required
numbers were obtained.
The participant information sheets (PIS), consent forms, and
topic guides for the interviews were developed in collaboration
with the project advisory group. Several topic guides were tailored
to ensure they were suitable for participants who experienced dif-
ferent pregnancy outcomes (e.g., stillbirth, live birth, termination).
Narrative topic guides allowed participants to tell their pregnancy
stories in chronological order. Participants were asked to discuss
their most recent pregnancy; however, many also drew on their
wider experiences of pregnancy and parenthood.
Interviews (including pilot interviews) were carried out by two
experienced female members of the research team (RB and HT)
between April and November of 2019. Interviews lasted approx-
imately 45-60 min. Participants were offered the option of in-
person or telephone interviews. Two pilot interviews were con-
ducted in-person and were deemed to be of a high enough quality
to be included in the analysis. All subsequent interviews were con-
ducted by telephone and recorded using a dictaphone. Participants
received high street vouchers worth €20. Interviewers made de-
tailed field notes following each interview. Audio files were tran-
scribed verbatim using a commercial transcription service. Elec-
tronic transcripts were stored separately to any identifiable data
on a secure IT system, and audio files deleted once they had been
checked for accuracy.
Ethical approval
Ethical approval was granted by the Research and Ethics com-
mittee of the School of Social Sciences at Cardiff University
SREC/3201.
Data analysis
Survey data were processed and analysed using Microsoft Excel
and STATA SE 15 (
StataCorp 2017).
The one-to-one interviews were analysed thematically follow-
ing Braun and Clarke's method (Braun and Clarke, 2006
Tran-
scripts were coded and analysed using Dedoose (SocioCultural Re-
search, 2018). All transcripts and accompanying data such as re-
searcher's field notes were read in detail several times by both in-
terviewers, and high-level codes pertaining to the original research
questions were identified. We identified further themes in the data
during this inductive process, resulting in a coding framework in-
formed by the data itself. Narrative summaries of data pertaining
Midwifery 113 (2022) 103433
to each code were produced and cross-checked by two researchers,
and subsequently organised into high-level themes.
The qualitative data from the interviews and quantitative data
from the survey were 'read' alongside each other and are presented
together (Ivankova et al., 2006).
Research team
The research team is trained in and had extensive experience
of working in pregnancy-related research and practice including
social sciences (RB and HT), medical law (IS), public health (RB,
JS, and HT) and clinical midwifery (JS). The research project was
motivated and guided by the team's commitment to the values of
feminist research (Jenkins et al., 2019) and informed choice.
Patient and public involvement
We formed a project oversight group to provide input into our
research design, data collection materials, and project outputs. This
group included representatives from maternity user groups, advo-
cates, healthcare professionals, and researchers.
Results
A total of 7090 women responded to the survey and 34 took
part in subsequent qualitative interviews. The qualitative data from
the interviews and quantitative data are presented together. Main
themes constructed through our inductive analysis were: sources
of information and advice; better safe than sorry; information
gaps; conflicting advice; challenges to autonomy; and stigmatised
risk communication.
Sociodemographic information and pregnancy history for the
survey population is presented in
Table 1, and for the interview
subpopulation in Table 2.
Sources of information and advice
Participants received information about how to have a healthy
pregnancy from a range of sources. In addition to their healthcare
providers (HCPs), women sought out or received information from
social media, the mainstream media, family and friends, often with
contradictory messages.
Media
Several participants reflected on the emotional impact of read-
ing "scaremongering stories" in the traditional media. One woman
described how she had read an article about avoiding carrying
heavy items during pregnancy and subsequently believed she had
experienced a miscarriage because she had carried a car seat up a
flight of stairs;
"I remember reading somewhere you shouldn't be carrying heavy
loads and things, this, that and the other...l think I was moving
my daughter's car seat from my car and I carried it up a flight
of stairs and then literally I think a day or two later that's when
I had the miscarriage. I'm thinking maybe it was because of that,
that's why it happened. (WR14)
Whilst many participants described, "panicking about every-
thing" (WR14), feeling "stressed and helpless" (WR132), many also
recognised that warnings about avoiding risks during pregnancy
were "not 100% achievable" (WR130) and you've "got to take it all
with a pinch of salt" (WR127).

Social media
The majority of interview participants spoke about social me-
dia being a source of helpful information and advice, and many
had positive experiences of "due-date" Facebook groups. Simi-
larly, participants who had conditions such as Hyperemesis Gravi-
darum found that social media provided peer support. However,
many also recognised that social media was rife with mislead-
ing information and contradictory advice. Participants who were
in transnational pregnancy support groups noted the contradiction
in pregnancy-related advice across countries such as the number
of routine antenatal check-ups offered to women.
Family and friends
Participants were overwhelmingly positive about the support
provided to them by friends and their own mothers. In addition to
providing practical support, they offered advice and reassurance in
the face of an overwhelming landscape of pregnancy-related risk
information, as was the case with WRII who described how her
mum supported her when she was concerned about taking medi-
cation prescribed for Hyperemesis Gravidarum:
"I think my mum was very supportive and saying, like, "If the doc-
tors have prescribed it, it'll be fine and, like, you need it," basi-
cally." (WRII)
Partners were described by a small number of participants as
being "helpful and supportive". However, several participants ex-
pressed that they felt pressure to consider their partner's feelings
when making decisions about their lifestyle during pregnancy. One
woman described how her partner asked her to give up Coca Cola:
'When...you've got someone else in your life perhaps who's panick-
ing and, like, "Argh," it's a little bit more pressure than you would
want. You have to...tell them to calm down and rein it in a little
bit. Like, "It's going to be okay, don't worry," you know, "I'm still
going to look after myself. I'm still going to look after this baby."
(WR130)
Better safe than sorry
The survey data showed that women wanted a balance between
a "better safe than sorry" approach and evidence-based informa-
tion and advice (Table 4). The majority (67%; n = 4752) either
'strongly' or 'tended' to agree that when "scientists cannot rule
out the possibility of harm pregnant women should take a better
safe than sorry approach", and 72% (n =
5106) wanted straight-
forward "do or don't" advice. There were some scenarios in which
participants felt a particularly strong need to exercise caution and
adopt the precautionary principle, including when making deci-
5


R. Blaylock, H. Trickey, J. Sanders et al.
sions around the consumption of alcohol and use of prescription
medication:
"Because no one really knows what's a safe amount and what isn't,
and they are saying now, aren't they, just don't bother drinking
anything because we don't know what is a safe amount. I've had
maybe three drinks during pregnancy, and not even finished them.
So, god, such a negligible amount. It's been absolutely fine. I've
been alright with that, I've felt really good. And I think I needed
that. I've just seen it as, like, a detox" (WR132)
Despite the support for the precautionary principle, most sur-
vey respondents (73%; n = 5142) also wanted to have all the avail-
able evidence in order to make their own decisions about their
pregnancy. Survey free-text responses and interview data showed
that this extended to situations where there was a paucity of evi-
dence or uncertainty:
"A lot of standard advice seems to be based on a better safe than
sorry mindset especially as it's not always possible to conduct high
quality studies on pregnant women to generate robust evidence. I
personally find it more useful to understand the evidence base and
use this to make informed decisions, rather than be given a list of
rules to follow. Every individual and every pregnancy is different
and a do/don't approach fails to acknowledge this" (survey respon-
dent)
Some participants recognised that their own circumstances
made them more cautious about certain decisions and behaviours.
This was particularly the case with women who had experienced a
previous pregnancy loss who exercised a greater deal of caution in
subsequent pregnancies:
"I put two and two together in that scenario and thought, "Yes,
that's my fault."
I can't change it. I just think, when it came
to my next pregnancy, I changed my habits. I really, really, toned
down my drinking, especially in the run up to getting pregnant. I
think I waited, before I would have a glass of wine at weddings
and stuff like that. I think I probably waited until I was well over
the 12 weeks." (WR124)
Information gaps
In the interviews and survey, women reported a discrepancy
between the topics they received a lot of information on and areas
in which they felt they needed more advice. The following were
the top four topics that participants said were well-explained:
what to/not to eat during pregnancy (45%, n =
2484); vaccina-
tions during pregnancy for influenza and whooping cough (44%,
n = 2446); smoking before and during pregnancy (40%, n = 2211);
and drinking alcohol before and during pregnancy (39%, n = 2148).
In contrast, participants wanted more advice and information
on: managing mental health and pregnancy (40%, n = 2229); man-
aging stress and pregnancy (32%, n =
1750); infections such as
Group B Streptococcus, Toxoplasmosis, and Cytomegalovirus (30%,
1671); and infant feeding (30%, n = 1635). Many participants
expressed that they received information that was not relevant to
them at the expense of other areas where they needed better sup-
port:
"Although I didn't smoke or drink I received much better informa-
tion on this than anything else. I didn't receive any information on
maintaining good mental health during pregnancy and I feel this
contributed to me developing PND" (survey respondent)
Furthermore, participants described feeling unable to act on the
information about risk given to them. This was particularly the
case with mental health conditions, and 'risk factors' which were
unmodifiable at the time of pregnancy such as age or weight:
Midwifery 113 (2022) 103433
"God, I couldn't tell you which journal this paper came out in but
it was the study that looked at elevated cortisol in pregnant women
and behavioural issues in their children... That really stuck with me
because it came out and I was the most stressed person. I was so
stressed and I was trying to do things to de-stress but life was just so
all over the place that nothing worked. " (WR132)
Conflicting advice
Many participants said they were given conflicting advice by
HCPs on a range of issues including what to expect during labour
and birth; diagnosis of pregnancy-related conditions; and the
safety of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. A few women
also noted that advice at the policy level had changed over the
course of each of their pregnancies leading to confusion:
"I've had four pregnancies in four years, so one in 2015, '16, '17,
'18, and every single time the differences in just the protocols, the
way things have changed, information and how you're given it. Ev-
ery single time, it's been completely different." (WR121)
Several participants described conflicting messages from HCPS
about the safety of medication in pregnancy:
"As soon as she [GPI saw that I was on medication for mental
health, she was like, "So you're on antidepressants?" I said, "Yes. "
She went, "Well, what are we going to do about that?" I was like,
"Well, my midwife said it's fine, the risk to my baby. The risk to
myself if I came off them outweighed that, and it's a very minimal
risk. I was on a low dose. She said, "It's not okay. It's not okay. "
She was very sharp with me. It's like as if I was taking hard drugs
her something, her reaction was. She wouldn't give me a prescrip-
tion for Citalopram. She said, "You need to go on Sertraline. " I said,
"I don't feel comfortable with changing meds at the moment." It
took me a long time to find Citalopram and that really suits me.
She was like, "But you can't breastfeed on Citalopram." She was
assuming a lot of things, because I wasn't planning on breastfeed-
ing anyway. I took the prescription from her for Sertraline and I
was crying after the appointment. I went to the pharmacy think-
ing, "I'll just do it." Then the pharmacy were really funny with me
because I was getting Citalopram and Sertraline, because I needed
to wean myself off Citalopram first to start the Sertraline. That was
humiliating because it was in front of everybody. " (WR133)
Such conflicting messages are not without consequences. In ad-
dition to the anxiety and distress caused, contradictory messages
around the safety of medication can lead women to abstain from
taking prescribed medication out of fear of harming their baby:
"I am epileptic and though my seizures increased during pregnancy
I was too scared to tell my midwife as I was afraid of my medica-
tion being increased and the risks to my unborn baby. I ended up
being hospitalised during pregnancy because of my seizures and
my daughter had to be delivered early by caesarean section. I be-
lieve if I had been given more information about the medication
including risks and percentages that I wouldn't of been so scared
to increase my medication." (survey respondent)
Challenges to autonomy
The way in which information about risk was delivered to
women sometimes challenged their autonomy and had negative
implications for their relationships with their HCPS (Table 3
). Many
women initially implicitly trusted their HCPs. However, partial, or
inaccurate advice from HCPS was a source of anxiety for women,
and sometimes led to poor care:
"I'd asked several times, "Is there anything I can take for that?"
and she'd said, "No, there's nothing we can give you. You just have

take. There is no anti-sickness medication you can take in preg-
nancy. You just have to see it through. I just believed her. I thought,
"Right, okay. "
. I was worried that, if I did then go ask anybody
else or try and take something, it wouldn't be safe for my baby.
Like I say, she was really friendly. She was very personal... She
built a good relationship up with you quickly, so I felt like, "No, she
knows what she's doing. Trust her." I was so unwell that I spent
most of my days sleeping" (WR119)
Several participants reflected that the use of carbon monoxide
testing undermined their relationship with midwives who they felt
were trying to 'catch out' women who underreported their smok-
ing levels:
"I always thought it's bizarre asking someone for their subjective
answer and then you are almost like, "Right, well that means abso-
lutely nothing because we need to do a test of the carbon monox-
ide in your blood anyway." I think that's rubbish, really, because
the relationship between midwife and mother is really, really im-
portant. I think we should be making sure that's as strong as

possible throughout pregnancy....l think [testing] strengthens that
power imbalance between clinician and patient" (WR132)
Several survey respondents also reported their data being
shared with third parties, such as Slimming World, which further
undermined trust between them and their midwife:
"Because of my weight (high BMI) I was offered an additional ser-
vice about losing weight which I did not want, I declined and it
still was pushed on me and she turned up to my appointment
without my consent" (survey respondent)
A breakdown in trust has serious implications for women's rela-
tionships with their midwives and other care givers. Although 61%
(n = 4332) of survey participants reported feeling trusted to decide
what was best for themselves and their babies, 26% (n = 1835) re-
ported that they sometimes felt judged by HCPS for their choices
and actions. Some described lying to their midwives about their
behaviours because they felt judged:
"I generally felt I was judged for some of the foods I ate and the
occasional alcoholic drink. As a pharmacist, I used my professional

Stigmatised communication of risk
We identified that younger women (<20 years old) and women
with higher BMIs had a distinct and stigmatised experience of ma-
ternity care.
Younger mothers
Women who became mothers under the age of 20 had a dis-
tinct experience of risk messaging, and several described the ad-
vice they received as instructional. One woman explained that she
"felt like if I didn't do something, with my first baby especially,
that they'd take my baby off me or something" (WR131). One in-
terview participant (WR19) with four children said that the advice
she received during her pregnancies changed as she got older. Dur-
ing her first pregnancy she found the support from a health visi-
tor to be useful but "condescending". In contrast, during her later
pregnancies she found HCPS to be more respectful of her wishes.
One woman (WRIII) suggested that family and friends compen-
sated for a lack of information provided about labour and birth by
HCPs, and was concerned that women even younger than herself
may find the paucity of advice and information "scary". WR19 sug-
gested that all first-time mothers should be treated the same, re-
gardless of their age:
"I think they should ... be treated like any other first-time mum,
because I bet there are 30-odd-year-old mums out there that prob-
ably know the same amount as an 18-year-old who's pregnant for
the first time. If you've not done it before, you don't know." (WR19)
Another younger participant reflected on how partial advice left
them unprepared for the consequences of obstetric injuries:
"I wish I'd known more about obviously tears and stuff.
it
was the sort of situation where they said about it, but they sort
of went, "Oh, you're young, you won't have to worry about that
sort of thing. Third degree tears normally happen to older ladies, '"'
(WR13)
Women with higher BMIs

Approximately 26% (n =
feeling judged because of their weight and described dehumanisa-
tion and depersonalisation within the maternity care system. This
is exemplified by one woman who was present for conversations
about how staff would move her should she become incapacitated
in labour:
"I accept that there is also the risk of the idea of my body as an
object which is large. Therefore, in itself, poses a risk to staff who
8


R. Blaylock, H. Trickey, J. Sanders et al.
are handling my body. That is a very depersonalising way to think
about oneself I'm aware that is something that has to be consid-
ered, but I feel quite strongly that risk needs to be considered in
private and not in front of me." (WR122)
Another described how her weight dominated every interaction
with HCPs, leading her to feel like her pregnancy would not end
with a healthy baby:
"My weight dominated every conversation held with every single
medical professional and led me and my partner to be absolutely
convinced we wouldn't bring the baby to term. We were told re-
peatedly that the birth would be difficult, I wouldn't cope and that
there would be complications. I was told to have an epidural at
the first signs of labour as I would def need emergency interven-
tion so it made sense to do it at the beginning as I wouldn't be
able to control myself enough once the labour had started to do
it later on.... I was almost convinced I wouldn't be bringing my
baby home and even didn't do things like put up a cot" (survey
respondent)
Participants also described a failure to recognise efforts they
had made in the preconception period to mitigate against risk:
"I was overweight and many of my appointments seemed to fo-
cus more on my weight than anything else despite the fact that I
proved I had lost more than 6 stone in the 18 months before falling
pregnant" (survey respondent);
and a failure to contextualise risk:
"As I'm overweight I felt very anxious all the way through the
pregnancy as I was constantly being told I was at a higher risk
but no one could tell me by how much. It regularly made me feel
like I wasn't good enough to have a baby" (survey respondent)
Discussion
Overall, participants wanted a balance between a 'better safe
than sorry' approach and evidence-based information and advice.
Whilst most women were happy to adopt the precautionary prin-
ciple, others wanted more detailed information relating to risk. A
need for a well-informed layered approach to information provi-
Sion was evident to support honest discussions about risk, includ-
ing where there was uncertainty.
Other research on pregnancy related COVID -19 public health
messages found that women felt it was better to be "safer than
sorry", and over-interpreted advice to stringently socially-distance,
"shielding" from the outside world (Sanders and Blaylock, 2021 ).
Reflecting the hesitancy amongst pregnant women to accept the
COVID-19 vaccination (Skirrow et al., 2022; Blakeway et al., 2022),
in this research we found that even when counselled on the im-
portance of using medication by HCPs, some women preferred not
to do so out of fear of harming their baby, leaving them vulner-
able to serious deterioration in their health . Whilst the adoption
of the precautionary principle may be considered effective public
health messaging, we found concerning examples that the precau-
tionary approach enacted through self-policing behaviours can lead
to negative outcomes for the woman herself. We found that dif-
ferent women had different appetites for risk, and this was often
shaped by previous experiences. Whilst cognisant of the fact that
there was unlikely to be a causative link between a behaviour such
as carrying something heavy or drinking a small amount of alco-
hol and miscarriage, some women having experienced miscarriage
felt that no avoidable risk was acceptable when it came to sub-
sequent pregnancies. However, this was not universal, and what
may have been a small or negligent risk to one person (e.g., drink-
ing a small amount of alcohol) may have felt like a huge risk to
another.
Midwifery 113 (2022) 103433
Women have different appetites for risk, with their tolerance
often changing over time shaped by their own experiences. In the
absence of any evidence of harm about a particular behaviour,
they should be free to adopt or reject the precautionary princi-
ple (
McDonald et al., 2011 However, it becomes more challeng-
ing where there is a known risk to the fetus such as in the pre-
scribing of drugs with teratogenic effects such as Sodium Valproate
(Valproate Pregnancy Prevention Programme 2022). Whilst being
well motivated, formal healthcare guidelines that mandate a pre-
cautionary approach undermine women's autonomy, are stigma-
tising, and remove their ability to make decisions for themselves
(Royal College of Midwives 2021; Lee et al., 2021). Increasingly,
women who make what others deem to be 'risky' decisions are
seen as transgressive according to social norms which dictate what
an ideal mother should do (
Kukla, 2008).
Our participants explained that there was a mismatch between
the topics they received a lot of information on and areas in
which they felt they needed more advice and support. For ex-
ample, smoking and drinking alcohol in pregnancy were identi-
fied as topics which participants received a lot of information.
In contrast, participants wanted more advice on managing men-
tal health conditions during pregnancy. Some participants felt that
this over-focus on certain topics caused them to experience bad
outcomes, such as post-natal depression. Gaps in the information
provided to pregnant women, and conflicting advice, may leave
them to make their own decisions without any support. With-
out any guidance from healthcare professionals on issues such as
whether it is safe to take particular medications in pregnancy, they
are left to the mercy of the sea in which they swim- the prevail-
ing cultural ideas about what is and is not appropriate behaviour
in pregnancy and the imperative to protect the foetus at all costs-
even at their own expense (Maternity Decisions Induction Survey,
2021
The attention given to some topics in public health messag-
ing during pregnancy arguably reflects the research agenda and
accessibility of data. There is a trend particularly within the De-
velopmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) paradigm, to
use large cohort studies to ascertain associations between mater-
nal exposures and foetal outcomes. There is an implicit assumption
about the "causal primacy of maternal pregnancy effects" and this
sets the agenda of DOHaD research which is reinforced and repro-
duced, rather than challenged (Sharp et al., 2018). Our research on
the reporting of pregnancy related studies found that the majority
of studies that were reported in the UK mainstream media frame
mothers, rather than protective towards their unborn infants, as
vectors of potential harm to their children, who are the focus of
the health outcomes (Marshall et al., 2021). A recent report found
an imbalance between women's research priorities, such as peri-
natal mental health and research funding, suggesting a realign-
ment of research priorities with women's needs is urgently needed
(Guthrie et al., 2020).
The use of carbon monoxide testing to validate women's self-
reported behaviours, and referrals to additional support without
consent were described as undermining the relationship between
women and their midwives. Others have also identified the use of
carbon monoxide testing in maternity care as having the poten-
tial to "do more harm than good" (Bowden, 2019). By not trusting
women's self-reports, testing for carbon monoxide exposure leaves
women feeling judged and not trusted which could lead to disen-
gagement with services, and is at odds with shared-decision mak-
ing (
O'Brien et al., 2021). We found that when they felt judged,
women were more likely to lie or hide their behaviour, which
is consistent with findings from other research on working class
mothers and smoking in Wales (Grant et al., 2020)
Women with higher BMIs and younger mothers reported rou-
tine stigmatisation, dehumanisation, and a lack of kindness within

maternity care. Younger women described feeling they risked hav-
ing their baby taken into care if they did not comply with instruc-
tions. To receive care under such a climate of fear hinders the for-
mation of trusting relationships between women and their health
care providers (Sanders et al., 2016; McLeish and Redshaw, 2019).
Furthermore, around a quarter of women felt judged for their
weight. As mentioned previously, when women feel judged they
are less likely to engage in healthcare which can have ramifications
for maternal and foetal health.
Women with higher BMIs described the distress caused by hav-
ing to repeat their story multiple times, and a failure to recog-
nise the weight-loss journey they may have been on prior to each
appointment/meeting each new midwife. Within expanding mid-
wifery continuity of carer (MCoC) teams, midwives should be able
to provide more individualised care.
Some of our participants described being told they were "at
risk" or had a high-risk pregnancy but not being told how much
greater their risk of a poor outcome was. This was particularly
the case with risk factors which were unmodifiable at the time
of pregnancy such as having a high BMI or suffering from a pre-
existing health condition. This failure to contextualise risk derives
from how risk is calculated from population-level epidemiological
studies and extrapolated and applied to the individual in a clinic
setting (
WRISK 2021
Pregnancy is often characterised as a "teachable moment" dur-
ing which healthcare professionals can educate women and im-
prove their health (Atkinson et al., 2016). This leads to a greater fo-
cus on the individual determinants of health, rather than the social
or structural determinants of health which require a longer lead-
time and collective, population-level efforts to resolve. This fo-
cus on the individual determinants of public health is a departure
from current trends within public health more broadly which fo-
cus on social determinants. Acknowledging the diffculty in trying
to solve public health 'problems' in a 9-month window, there is a
growing focus on improving women's health in the pre-conception
period, regardless of their pregnancy planning intentions (Budds,
2021
Whilst we did not interview HCPs, we identified that system-
level constraints also contribute to the poor communication of
risk and public health messages. The sheer volume of pub-
lic health initiatives and information provided on a wide range
of topics means that antenatal care appointments can become
"tick-box" exercises, rather than tailoring the appointment to
meet a woman's individual needs. Midwives are constrained
by short appointment times, a lack of training, and resources
(Sanders et al., 2016) which inevitably means that some infor-
mation is prioritised. This is compounded by serious staff short-
ages (NHS, 2021). Again, MCoC may contribute to more individ-
ualised care but plans for universal implementation have been
delayed (
Sandall et al., 2016; Delivering Midwifery Continuity
2021
These structural issues mean the quality of a woman's ante-
natal experience is contingent on who they happen to see that
particular day, how knowledgeable they are, and whether they
have time to meet their individual needs. This is evidenced by
our findings that a woman with Hyperemesis Gravidarum was
told by her midwife that there was no safe medication that
she could take. More recently, anecdotal evidence emerged of
pregnant women being turned away from COVID-19 vaccination
centres or being told by their midwives that vaccination for
COVID-19 is not safe in pregnancy- contrary to the evidence-
base (
The Guardian 2022). Ultimately, we are yet to decide who
gets to choose what is an acceptable risk to take in pregnancy.
Women's and HCPs' appetites for risk might be different, and when
they are discordant this can lead to gatekeeping and conflicting
advice.

Strengths and limitations
Our study included over 7000 women from across the UK.
Our purposive sampling frame ensured our interview population
included higher proportions of ethnic minorities and women on
low incomes than at the UK population level, ensuring the most
marginalised women were represented. However, the sampling
frame design may have shaped our findings and focused atten-
tion on certain experiences of risk communication at the expense
of others, for example, the stigmatisation of women with higher
BMIs.
Our survey was self-selecting and may reflect the views of
those more motivated to participate in research. Given the survey
was hosted online, we are mindful that it excluded those with-
out access to the internet. Furthermore, our survey and interviews
were restricted to those who could speak English and therefore ex-
cluded non-English speakers who are likely to have more diffcul-
ties accessing and navigating the maternity care system in the UK.
Conclusion
Our research shows the importance of risk communication that
respects women's autonomy and trusts them to make decisions
about their own pregnancy. Our findings support principles which
have been previously identified in aiding high quality risk com-
munication, and we recommend that HCPs involved in delivering
risk messages familiarise themselves with these (Freeman, 2019)
We identified a need for a layered approach to risk communica-
tion. Whilst some women are happy to adopt precautionary be-
haviour without discussion, others will want a thorough exami-
nation of the evidence-base and its limitations. Our findings sug-
gest that more individualised care, continuity, and less judgement
and stigmatisation from HCPS will improve experiences for women
and may lead to better engagement with services. A realignment
of research priorities with women's own needs will likely lead
to improved evidence to support their care. Ultimately, our re-
search demonstrates that women want what is best for their preg-
nancy and children. Women should be well informed and then
trusted and supported to make decisions based on their own
circumstances.

Use of integrase inhibitors vs protease inhibitors is
associated with improved HIV viral suppression

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines for antiretroviral therapy in preg-
nancy include the use of a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
with either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or a ritonavir-boosted pro-
tease inhibitor, although there is no designation of which is the preferred
option.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare viral suppression at delivery
among patients on dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors com-
bined with either an integrase strand transfer inhibitor or a protease inhibi-
tor. A hypothesis was made that the incidence of viral suppression is
higher with the use of a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor
backbone combined with an integrase strand transfer inhibitor than with
the use of a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone
combined with a protease inhibitor.
STUDY DESIGN: This study was an obsetwational study of pregnant
patients living with HIV who received prenatal care and delivered after 20
weeks of gestation at an urban safety net hospital. All pregnant patients
with HIV were referred to a centralized clinic for HIV counseling, medica-
tion management, and prenatal care. Antiretroviral therapy was continued
or initiated according to protocols based on national guidance. Among
patients on a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor backbone
combined with integrase strand transfer inhibitor vs protease inhibitor at
delivery, we compared the demographics and HIV disease characteristics,
including year of diagnosis, viral load, and antiretroviral therapy class. The
outcome of interest was viral suppression at delivery, defined as a viral
RESULTS: From January 2011 to December 2021, 604 patients on
dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor met the inclusion criteria,
including 411 patients (68%) on protease inhibitor and 193 patients
(32%) on integrase strand transfer inhibitor at delivery. Demographic dis-
tribution was similar, and prenatal care was initiated at 1 2 weeks of gesta-
tion. Among the integrase strand transfer inhibitor group, 101 (17%) were
on antiretroviral therapy at initiation of prenatal care compared with 169
(28%) in the protease inhibitor group. At delivery, the frequency of viral
load suppression was higher among those on an integrase strand transfer
inhibitor (147/193[76%]) than among those on a protease inhibitor (275/
411 [67%]) (odds ratio, 1.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.08—2.33).
Among those with a detectable virus, quantitative viral load was not differ-
ent. During the study period, the use of a protease inhibitor decreased,
whereas the use of an integrase strand transfer inhibitor increased.
CONCLUSION: Among pregnant patients living with HIV, viral suppres-
Sion was more common among those on a dual-nucleoside reverse tran-
scriptase inhibitor backbone combined with integrase strand transfer
inhibitor than among those on a dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor backbone protease inhibitor at delivery. Our results support the
use of dual-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with integrase strand
transfer inhibitor as a first-line antiretroviral therapy regimen in pregnancy.

Introduction
he annual number of infants born
in the United States to patients
living with HIV has decreased to an
estimated 5000 deliveries in 2015.
With improvement in the efforts to
decrease vertical transmission, the
Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention has made it its goal to elimi-
nate mother-to-child transmission in
the United States. The risk of vertical
transmission lowers with decreasing
viral load, with the goal to have com-
plete viral suppression before delivery.

The guidelines for antiretroviral ther-
apy (ART) developed by the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services
Panel on Treatment of HIV During
Pregnancy and Prevention of Perinatal
Transmission have changed signifi-
cantly over the past decade. After the
Pediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group
Protocol 076 (PACT076) trial was
published in 1994, the guidelines rec-
ommended a combination regimen,
including a dual-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and
either a non-NRTI or a protease
inhibitor (P I) as the preferred first-
line regimen for ART-nai&e pregnant

inhibitors (INST Is) were first included
in 2015 as part of a possible preferred
5
regimen with a dual-NRT I backbone.
A dual-NRT I plus either a ritonavir-
boosted PI or an INSTI is still the
preferred regimen based on the most
recent guidelines published in 2023. In
addition, it is recommended that
patients who are not ART-naive and
present to pregnancy fully suppressed
continue their current regimen pro-
vided that there is no other preg-
nancy-related concern regarding the
6
medications.
First-line ART regimens for nonpreg-
nant individuals include the use of
INST Is because of their high efficacy,
tolerability, safety, and high barrier to
resistance; low pill burden; and low
7
potential for drug-drug interactions.
This study aimed to evaluate the fre-
quency of viral suppression at delivery
when comparing pregnant patients on
an INST I-based regimen vs pregnant
patients on a P I-based regimen in com-
bination with a dual-NRT I backbone.
We hypothesized that viral suppression

Why was this study conducted?
This study aimed to determine whether an integrase strand transfer inhibitor
(INSTI)— or protease inhibitor (Pl)—based regimen combined with a dual-
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRT I) was associated with an
increased incidence of viral suppression at delivery in pregnant patients living
with HIV.
Key findings
Pregnant individuals living with HIV on a dual-NRT I backbone regimen that
included an INSTI achieved viral suppression at delivery with greater frequency
compared with those on a Pl.
What does this add to what is known?
Real-world evidence comparing antiretroviral regimens in pregnancy is lacking,
and we demonstrate that INST I-based regimens are effective at achieving com-
plete viral load suppression at delivery.
at delivery was higher with INSTI than
with Pl.
Materials and Methods
We conducted an observational study of
pregnant patients living with HIV who
delivered Parkland Health from January
2011 to December 2021. The study was
approved by the institutional review
board. The inclusion criteria included
all pregnant patients living with HIV
who presented to care at our high-risk
antepartum clinic. Patients were
excluded from analysis if they

experienced early pregnancy loss, did
not deliver at our institution, viral load
was not collected at delivery, or if their
ART regimen was not a dual-NRT I
backbone with either an INSTI or PI at
delivery. The primary exposure was
presence of INSTI or PI in combination
with dual-NRTI backbone as part of the
patient's ART regimen. The primary
outcome was presence of viral suppres-
Sion at delivery, defined as a viral load
of <50 copies/mL. The secondary out-
comes included a viral load at delivery if
viremia is present. We recorded

demographics, including age, parity,
race and ethnicity, estimated gestational
age (determined by best obstetrical esti-
mate) at the first prenatal visit, years
since HIV diagnosis, viral load, and
ART medication class at presentation.
At delivery, we recorded viral load, any
ART medication changes, and if intra-
venous (I V) zidovudine was adminis-
tered at delivery. Neonatal outcomes
recorded included birthweight of
<2500 g, neonatal intensive care unit
(NICU) admission, grade 3 or 4 intra-
ventricular hemorrhage (I V H), need for
continuous positive airway pressure or
mechanical ventilation, and if vertical
transmission occurred. All data were
maintained in a password-protected,
encrypted server, accessed only by study
personnel.
Among individuals with multiple
pregnancies during the study period, we
considered ART regimens during each
pregnancy separately. We based clinical
decisions for ART therapy on national
perinatal clinical guidelines, patient
preference, patient-reported adherence,
and historical ART experience and viral
load monitoring throughout pregnancy.
Our institutional practice is to adminis-
ter intravenous zidovudine for all
patients at the time of delivery, regard-
less of viral suppression. Neonatal HIV
prophylaxis and testing were performed
following existing clinical guidelines.
Perinatal HIV transmission was
determined on the basis of infant HIV
DNA polymerase chain reaction results
before hospital discharge and subse-
quent testing up to 2 months after deliv-
ery. Statistical analysis included the use
of the chi-square test to test the associa-
tion between 2 comparison groups with
a P<.05 considered significant and a
logistic regression model that adjusted
for potential confounders. Analysis was
performed in R (version 4.1.2; R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria).
Results
From January 1, 2011, to December 31,
2021, 919 individuals living with HIV
presented to care, including 242 newly
diagnosed during pregnancy. Of these
pregnancies, 189 were excluded from


analysis for early pregnancy loss, deliv-
ery at another institution, or viral load
not collected at delivery. An additional
126 were excluded as they were not on
the regimens being studied (Figure 1)
Of 604 patients taking dual-NRTI who
met the inclusion criteria for the analy-
sis, 411 patients (68%) were prescribed
P I, and 193 patients (32%) were pre-
scribed INSTI at delivery. During the
study period, the use of PI decreased,
whereas the use of INSTI increased
Figure 2). Patients on INSTI were
older than those on PI (median age: 29
years [interquartile range (IQR), 25
—34] for patients of INSTI vs 27 years
[IQR, 23—32] for patients of P I; P=.OI)
(Table 1). There was no difference in
race or ethnicity between the 2 groups.
Patients in both groups initiated prena-
tal care at approximately 12 weeks of
gestation. There was a significant differ-
ence in the number of years since diag-
nosis, with those on INSTI living with
HIV for a median of 4.8 years and
those on PI living with HIV for a
median of 2.6 years (P<.OI). At deliv-
ery, 147 of 193 patients (76%) on INSTI
achieved viral suppression, whereas 275
of 411 patients (67%) on PI achieved
viral suppression (odds ratio [OR], 1.59;

Comment
Principal findings
In this 10-year cohort of pregnant
patients with HIV who delivered at our
institution, complete viral suppression
at delivery was associated with an
INST I-based combined ART regimen
instead of a PI-based combined ART
regimen. Among patients who did have
viremia at delivery, there was no differ-
ence in viral load among patients on an
INST I-based regimen vs among patients
on a P I-based regimen, in a cohort with
viral load representing the main objec-
tive marker of adherence. Over time
during the study period, the use of
INSTI increased, whereas the use of PI
decreased, likely reflecting evolving clin-
ical guidelines and increasing safety and
efficacy data for INSTI in individuals of
childbearing age and pregnancy. More-
over, we theorize that this trend demon-
strates indirect evidence of improved
patient adherence and patient and pro-
vider preference over a decade.

In our large referral center, our practice
is to continue virologically suppressive
regimens in pregnant patients who report
adherence with frequent viral monitoring.
Moreover, these patients were included in
the INSTI cohort. In our experience, a
once-daily complete regimen with low
pill burden and few side effects is ideal
for adherence and leads to successful viral
suppression at delivery. Over the past
decade, vertical transmission of HIV has
become extremely rare with the transition
to an INSTI-based dual-NRTI regimen in
our patient population.
Results in the context of what is
known
Safety and efficacy of INSTI in preg-
nancy is further supported by a multi-
site US-based cohort study, in which
TABLE 3
the authors found that, among 120
patients, the use of dolutegravir was
associated with a higher incidence of
viral suppression at delivery compared
with the use of nondolutegravir regi-
mens (including another INST I, ralte-
gravir), with no observable difference in
the risk of adverse fetal outcomes
among the regimens studied. In addi-
tion, this is consistent with the results
published by Rahangdale et al,10 which
suggested more rapid viral suppression
with the use of INST I-based regimens
compared with the use of non—lNSTI-
based regimens in a cohort of 101
patients. Our study expands the real-
world data on the use of INST I-based
ART in pregnancy in a large, urban
institution and supports the use of
INSTI over PI in pregnancy.

Our findings differed from 1 prospec-
tive cohort study that showed no differ-
ence in undetectable viral load among
pregnant patients near delivery on an
INST I-based regimen compared with a
P I-based regimen. However, the authors
found that patients in the INSTI group
demonstrated a lower median viral load
and a greater viral load reduction near
11
delivery. Most patients on an INSTI-
based regimen in that study were on ral-
tegravir as opposed to dolutegravir, and
this may explain the lack of statistical
difference in viral load at delivery.
However, acceptance and preference
for INSTI during pregnancy have not
been without challenges. An interim
analysis of a birth outcomes surveillance
study in Botswana released online in
12
2018 (published in 2019) by Zash et al
highlighted a slightly higher prevalence
of neural tube defects in patients taking
dolutegravir at conception with 3 per
1000 deliveries compared with 1 per
1000 deliveries in patients taking other
types of ART at conception. The result-
ing transition away from the use of
INSTI was swift among infectious dis-
ease providers caring for individuals
with childbearing potential, and this
effect is suggested by a dip in INSTI use
reflected in pregnant patients in 2019
Figure 2). However, the final analysis
of the data published by Zash et al in
2021 demonstrated that this difference
was not statistically significant and that
the trend in INSTI use again increased
in our cohort after 2019.
Clinical implications
In the absence of a randomized controlled
trial to determine superiority between
INSTIs and PIs in pregnancy, we demon-
strate superior viral suppression at delivery
with INSTI vs PI-based regimens over a
decade of treating underserved patients liv-
ing with HIV. The results of our study may
help clinicians considering regimens for
ART-nai&e pregnant patients or for their
patients who have not achieved complete
viral suppression on a given regimen. We
now prescribe dolutegravir with dual-
NRTI backbone as a first-line treatment
for all patients initiating ART in pregnancy,
regardless of trimester.

Background. Pregnancy risk perception affects a pregnant woman's decision about health care services such as prenatal care,
place of birth, choices about medical interventions, adherence to medical procedures, and recommendations. Therefore, the
study is aimed at assessing pregnancy risk perception and associated factors among pregnant women attending antenatal
care at health centers in Jabi Tehnan District. Methods. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among
424 mothers attending ANC at health centers in the Jabi Tehnan District from April 1 to 30, 2021. Data was collected
through a face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire which was developed according to the health belief
model. The logistic regression model was used using an adjusted odds ratio with 95% CI and pvalue < 0.05 to declare
significance and associations. Result. Four hundred twenty four (424) pregnant women were interviewed of which nearly
half of the respondents 48% (43.2%, 52.7%) had good pregnancy risk perception. Women who had a history of obstetric
complications (AOR: 95% CI = 3.44 : 1.73, 6.83), those who knew at least one pregnancy danger sign (AOR: 95% CI = 5.22,
2.46, 11.07), pregnant women who had a bad obstetric history (AOR: 95% CI= 2.23 : 1.13, 4.41), and knowing women who
died due to pregnancy-related complications (AOR: 95% 2.85 : 1.45, 5.60) were more likely to have good perception
towards pregnancy risk compared to their counterparts. Conclusion. Obstetric complications, awareness of pregnancy danger
signs, bad obstetric history, and known women who died due to pregnancy-related complications were found to be
significantly associated with pregnancy risk perception.
1. Background
Risk perception means an individual's expectation about the
probability, characteristics, and severity of an event, and it is
an important construction for different health behavior theories
such as the health belief model, protection motivation theory,
and prospect theory [1]. An individual making a judgment
about the probability of an event is based on experience [2].

A greater perception of health risks leads to conducting
protective action. Therefore, it is important to understand
the perception of health risks of pregnancy and the accuracy
of those perceptions [3]. Pregnancy risk perception affects a
pregnant woman's decision about health care services like
prenatal care, place of birth, choices about medical interven-
tions, adherence to medical procedures and recommenda-
tions, and health behaviors [4—6].
Pregnancy is a normal physiological process, but some
of the common discomforts of pregnancy may make the
pregnant woman feel ill. Ranging from mildly irritating to
life-threatening conditions [7], pregnancy and childbirth
are often perceived as normal life events without justifica-
tion in many developing countries, including Ethiopia.
Obstetric complications are high among normal pregnan-
cies. These complications occurred following warning signs
called obstetric danger signs [8—11].
The top commonly manifested danger signs during
labor and childbirth are severe vaginal bleeding, prolonged
labor, convulsions, and retained placenta. Besides, danger-
ous signs might occur during the postnatal period, which
include severe vaginal bleeding, unconsciousness, and fever
[12, 13]. Every pregnant woman is at risk of facing
pregnancy-related complications that could end in death
or injury to both herself and the newborn [14]. From
pregnancy-related complications, hemorrhage, obstructed
labor, pregnancy-induced hypertension, puerperal sepsis,
and unsafe abortion are the five leading causes of maternal
death in Ethiopia from 1990 to 2016. Early detection and
management of those complications are important to
reduce maternal mortality [15].
Pregnancy and childbirth complications are major causes
of maternal death. Complications that develop during
pregnancy account for 72.5% of maternal deaths are called
direct causes of maternal death. Globally, the magnitudes
of direct cause's maternal death are hemorrhage (27.1%),
pregnancy-induced hypertension (14%), puerperal sepsis
(10.7%), and unsafe abortion (7.9%). In Ethiopia, hemor-
rhage (29.9%), obstructed labor (22.34%), pregnancy-
induced hypertension (16.9%), puerperal sepsis (14.68%),
and unsafe abortion (8.6%) are major causes of maternal
death [15—17].
Due to obstetric complications globally every day, 810
women died. The developing countries accounted for
94% (277,300) of these deaths. Of these eighty-six percent
of deaths are occurred in both Sub-Saharan Africa and
Southern. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest maternal
mortality ratio at 66.44% (196 000) of maternal deaths
annually. In Ethiopia, the maternal mortality ratio is sig-
nificantly reduced from 1030 deaths per 100,000 live births
(2000) to 401 death per 100,000 live births (2017), but it
remains high [18].
The maternal mortality ratio in developing countries in
2015 is twenty times higher than in developed countries.
The difference in maternal mortality ratio is also present
within countries between urban and rural residents and
between high and low-income women [19].
Pregnancy and childbirth-related mortality are unavoid-
able due to three delays. These are delays in deciding to
International Journal of Reproductive Medicine
seek care, delays in accessing and reaching appropriate
care, and delays in receiving appropriate care once a
health facility is reached. The first delay influences the
probability of the second and third delay. Their poor per-
ception of pregnancy-related risks and complications leads
pregnant women to delay decision-making to seek obstet-
ric care [20, 21].
Therefore, this study is intended to determine pregnancy
risk perception and associated factors among pregnant
women attending antenatal care at health centers in Jabi
Tehnan District, Amhara, Northwest Ethiopia, 2021.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Area and Period. The study was conducted in
Jabi Tehnan District, West Gojjam Zone, Amhara Region,
Northwest Ethiopia. Jabi Tenhnan is bordered on the
southwest by Dembech, on the west by Bure, on the
northwest by Sekela, on the north by Kuarit, and on the
east of Degadamot district. It is located at 387 km from
Addis Ababa in the northwest part of Ethiopia. According
to the report from the district in 2016, it has 39 kebeles
with a total population of 218,447 and 125,323 adults. In
the district, there are 11 health centers and 39 health
posts. The health centers give different clinical services
such as family planning, antenatal care, delivery, and test-
ing of HIV for the nearby community. All health centers
provide ANC services for the nearby community. The
majority of the inhabitants practiced Orthodox Christian-
ity (97.96%) while 2.02% were Muslim [22, 23]. This study
was conducted from April 01, 2021 to April 30, 2021.
2.2. Study Design. Institution-based cross-sectional study
design was employed.
2.3. Source and Study Population. The source population of
this study was all pregnant women coming to antenatal care
service in Jabi Tehnan District health centers, and the study
population was all pregnant women attending to antenatal
care service in Jabi Tehnan District health centers during
the data collection period.
2.4. Sample Size Determination. The sample size was calcu-
lated using the single population proportion formula by con-
sidering 50% of the population has good pregnancy risk
perception. The size of the sample was calculated as follows:
z2a/2 x (p(l -p))
(i) n was the sample size
(1)
(ii) Z2a/2 was the 95% confidence interval (standard
value of 1.96)
(iii) P was the estimated proportion of patients with
good pregnancy risk perception = 50%
(iv) d is the margin of error (precision error) = ±5%

Then, by adding a 10% nonresponse rate, the total
sample size was 424.
2.5. Sampling Technique and Procedure. There are eleven
health centers in the Jabi Tehnan District. All health centers
were included in the study, and a systematic sampling tech-
nique was used to collect data. The total number of pregnant
women attending ANC per month for the previous three
consecutive months in each health center was taken from
the ANC tally record book. The average number of pregnant
women attending ANC per month was calculated. Based on
the total number of pregnant women attending antenatal
care in Jabi Tehnan District health center, the total sample
was divided to each health center proportionally. p = n/N,
p times of total antenatal care attendants per month in each
health center (Figure 1).
2.6. Inclusion and Exclusion
2.6.1. Inclusion Criteria. Pregnant women coming to antena-
tal care service in Jabi Tehnan District health center and no
exclusion.
2.7. Study Variables
2.7.1. Dependent Variables. Pregnancy risk perception
(poor/ good).
2.7.2. Independent Variables
(i) Sociodemographic factors (age, marital status, edu-
cation, occupation, religion, place of residence,
income, and partner education)
(ii) Knowing a woman who died due to pregnancy-
related complications
(iii) Obstetric factors (gravidity, parity, history of obstet-
ric complications, pregnancy danger signs, number
of ANC visits, and bad obstetric history)
(iv) Knowledge of pregnancy danger signs
2.7.3. Operational Definition. Pregnancy risk perception
means respondents' perception of their risk of developing
pregnancy-related complications and their perceived sever-
ity of consequences related to pregnancy and labor compli-
cations [24].
2.7.4. Data Collection Tools. The tools were first prepared in
English language and later translated into Amharic language
and back to English language again to maintain its consis-
tency and have four parts. These are the following indetails.
2.7.5. Tool I Sociodemographic Characteristics. Socio-
demographic characteristics such as age, marital status, edu-
cation, working status, place of residence, income, partner
education, and knowing a woman who died in pregnancy.

2.7.6. Tool II Obstetric Characteristics. Obstetric characteris-
tics such as total number of pregnancies, the total number of
live birth, history of obstetric complications during a previ-
ous pregnancy or labor and delivery or postnatal period,
history of current pregnancy danger signs, previous place
of birth, and bad obstetric history.
2.7.7. Tool III Knowledge of Pregnancy Danger Signs. The
client's knowledge of pregnancy danger signs is assessed as
a factor for their perception of pregnancy risk. Knowledge
about pregnancy danger signs (yes or no options for being
familiar with each pregnancy danger sign) is the source of
information about the pregnancy danger sign. This tool con-
sists of 10 questions, which focus on general knowledge of
pregnancy danger signs.
2.7.8. Tool IV Pregnancy Risk Perception Using the Health
Belief Model. The client's pregnancy risk perception using
health belief model constructs was assessed. Clients are
asked a question about two constructs of the health belief
model that ranges from five to twenty-five score for
perceived susceptibility and seven to thirty-five score for
perceived severity. The total scores were calculated from
the combined questions ranging from twelve to sixty. The
questions have five options (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = dis-
agree, 3 = neutral, 4 = agree, and 5 = strongly agree) [25].
(1) Data Collection Procedure. Data were collected from
April 1 to 30, 2021. Eleven midwives who are not working
at the study site were recruited and trained for data collec-
tion. One day of training on the objective of the study,
methods of data collection procedures, and tools of data
collection for data collectors and supervisors were given.
Each data collector completed questionnaires by interview-
ing clients who came on the day and completed them
within 30 days. Regular supervision was done during data
collection.
(2) Data Quality Control Measuers. To ensure the quality of
data, the training was given on the objective of the study,
methods of data collection procedures, and tools of data
collection by the researcher. A pretest was conducted in
5% of the sample on March 2021 Finote Selam health center.
Cronbach's alphas (0.89 up to 0.90) were used to check the
internal consistency and reliability of the item. The neces-
sary modification was made for any ambiguity, confusion,
and diffcult words based on pretest data analysis. Each data
collector and supervisor were checked before and immedi-
ately after collection for the completeness and consistency
of the questionnaire.
(3) Data Processing and Analysis. The data was cleaned,
coded and entered, and analyzed using Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20. Descriptive statistics
such as frequency, percentage, standard deviation, and mean
were used to characterize the participants in terms of socio-
demographic variables, obstetric variables, and knowledge of
pregnancy danger signs. A logistic regression model was
fitted to assess the association between dependent and inde-

pendent variables with a p value of <0.25 in the bivariable
analysis that will be included in the multivariable analysis.
The adjusted odds ratio together with 95% confidence inter-
vals was computed, and the results with pvalue < 0.05 were
considered to declare a result as significantly associated.
3. Results
3.1. Sociodemographic Characteristics. Four hundred twenty-
one pregnant women have completed the questionnaire
making the response rate of the study 99.3%. The mean
age of respondents was 26.99 + 6.22, and nearly one-third
(33.3%) of respondents were aged between 25 and 29 years.
All respondents were Amhara in ethnicity, and 93.8% were
orthodox in religion. Almost all the respondents (99.8%)
were married, and more than half (58.7%) of the respon-
dents were housewives. Of the total study participants, 57%
of respondents lived in rural areas. Concerning educational
status, slightly more than one-third (42.7%) of respondents
have no formal schooling (Table 1).


International Journal of Reproductive Medicine
3.2. Obstetric Characteristics. Of 421 respondents, 47.5%
were primigravida, and 48% were nulliparous. Of multigra-
vida women, 52% had experienced obstetric complications
in the previous pregnancy or labor or postpartum period,
and the majority (64.3%) of respondents had no history of
bad obstetric history (Table 2).
3.3. Knowledge of Pregnancy Danger Signs. Vaginal bleeding
(87.9%) was the most common mentioned danger sign dur-
ing pregnancy followed by loss of fetal movement (53.2%),
the onset of labor before the expected date of delivery
(52.2%), and persistent vomiting (48.4%). The least men-
tioned danger signs during pregnancy were convulsion/loss
of consciousness (27.1%) (Table 3).
3.4. Pregnancy Risk Perception. Of the total respondents,
nearly half of them, 48% (43.2% and 52.7%), had good preg-
nancy risk perception as shown in (Figure 2).
Concerning the perceived severity of pregnancy-related
complications, 57.9% perceived that pregnancy and delivery
problems would last a long time while 55.9% of respondents
perceived that pregnancy complications would not threaten
the relationship with their partner. The majority of the
respondents (74.3%) perceived that their baby will be born
prematurely. 32.8% of respondents strongly agree that their
baby would not survive the pressure that comes with labor
and delivery (Table 4).
3.5. Factors Affecting Pregnancy Risk Perception in Jabi
Tehnan. In bivariable analysis, residence, own income,
knowing a woman who died due to pregnancy-related com-
plications, past obstetric complications, current pregnancy
danger signs, the number of ANC visits, bad obstetric history,
and awareness of pregnancy danger signs showed p value less
than 0.25 making them eligible for multivariable analysis.
In multivariable analysis awareness of pregnancy danger
signs, bad obstetric history, past obstetric complications, and
knowing a woman who died due to pregnancy-related com-
plications were associated with pregnancy risk perception.
Those who know at least one pregnancy danger sign were
5.2 times (AOR: 95% CI = 5.22 : 2.46, 11.07) more likely to
have good pregnancy risk perception than their counter-
parts. Respondents who had bad obstetric history were 2.2
times (AOR: 95% CI = 2.23 : 1.13, 4.41) more likely to have
good pregnancy risk perception than their counterparts.
Respondents who had past obstetric complications were
3.44 times (AOR: 95% CI = 3.44 : 1.73, 6.83) more likely to
have good pregnancy risk perception than their counter-
parts. Knowing women died due to pregnancy-related com-
plications were 2.85 times (AOR: 95% CI = 2.85 : 1.45, 5.60)
more likely to have good pregnancy risk perception than
their counterparts (Table 5).
4. Discussion
A major finding of this study was that above half of pregnant
women had significantly poor risk perception. Out of the
total study subjects, 48% had a good pregnancy risk percep-
tion. The independent variables that affect pregnancy risk
perception were history of obstetric complications, knowing

women who died due to pregnancy-related complications,
bad obstetric history, and awareness of pregnancy danger
signs.
In this study, 48% of pregnant women had a good
pregnancy risk perception. Studies conducted at health and
medical enters of Hamadan City in the west of Iran, 2
tertiary-care hospitals in Winnipeg, Manitoba, two major
teaching hospitals of a city in Western Canada, and urban
tertiary care hospital in western Canada showed that their
mean score perception of pregnancy risk was below the
midpoint of scales. It means that 100% of their study par-
ticipants perceived that their susceptibility to pregnancy-
related complications was mild. This difference might be
due to that all the research was conducted using a visual
analog scale tool measurement which is only administered
for literate people, data collection tool difference, sociocul-
tural difference, sample size difference, and time gap of the
study [26—29].
This study showed that 48.9% (43.9% and 53.7%) of
study subjects perceived that they were susceptible to
pregnancy-related complications. This finding was higher
than those studies conducted in Mandera County, Kenya
(14.5%). This difference might be due to sociocultural differ-
ences of study participants, study population, and time gap
of the study [25].
This research showed that 29.7% (25.7% and 34.4%) of
pregnant women were perceived them to be susceptible to
bad pregnancy outcomes, and 58.2% (53.7% and 62.9%)
were perceived that they are susceptible to difficult preg-
nancy periods. This finding was consistent with the study
conducted in Mandera County, Kenya (28.2%) [25].
In this study, 74.3% (70.5% and 78.4%) of pregnant
women perceived that their baby will be born prema-
turely. This result was consistent with studies conducted
in Mandera County, Kenya (75%). But studies con-
ducted at Hamadan City, Iran and Winnipeg, Manitoba
showed that mean score perceptions were below the
midpoint of scales that indicate mild risk perception.
This difference might be due to the difference of mea-
surement scale, sociocultural difference, and time gap of
the study [25, 26, 28].
This study revealed that 45.1% (40.1% and 49.9%) of
pregnant women were perceived that the occurrence of preg-
nancy complications would not threaten their relationship
with their partners, which is lower than a study conducted
in Mandera County, Kenya (51%). This difference might
be due to the sociocultural difference of study participants
and the time gap of the study. Besides, it may be because
Ethiopian women were honest with their husbands to keep
their promise during the marriage [25].

In this study, mean score perception pregnancy risk in
pregnant women showed that they did not perceive that they
are at risk for dying due to pregnancy-related complications.
Studies conducted in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Western Canada,
and the west of Iran had mild risk perception. This difference
may be due to differences in measurement scale, data collec-
tion tool, sociocultural difference, and educational status of
respondents [26—28].
Approximately, seventy percent of women perceived that
their babies would die during labor and delivery. This result
was inconsistent with studies conducted in western Canada
and Hamadan City in the west of Iran. This difference may
be due to differences in measurement scale, sociocultural
difference, and educational status of respondents [26, 27].
Pregnant women who had awareness of pregnancy
danger signs were more likely to have positive pregnancy
risk perception than their counterparts. This may be due to
knowledge about pregnancy danger signs clearing rumors
about pregnancy-related complications and increasing their
awareness about pregnancy-related complications.
According to this study, pregnant women with bad obstet-
ric history were more likely to have positive pregnancy risk
perception. This may be due to pregnant women being famil-
iarized with the bad obstetric outcome and learning their
susceptibility towards pregnancy-related complications.
In this research, one of the factors that affecting posi-
tively, pregnancy risk perception was knowing a woman
who died due to pregnancy-related complications. This
may be because these women learned the probability of
developing pregnancy-related complications as well as the
consequences of pregnancy-related complications from
women's death due to pregnancy-related complications.
Generally, pregnant women with a bad obstetric his-
tory, past obstetric complication, and knew a woman
who died due to pregnancy-related complications were
associated with pregnancy risk perception. This result
was similar to the concept of availability of the Heuristic
approach which means that an individual makes a judg-
ment about likelihood of an event based on experience
or information from others [2]. In this study, experience
and information from others are pregnant women with
bad obstetric history and past obstetric complications
and knew a woman who died due to pregnancy-related
complications, respectively.
In this study, age of pregnant women is not significantly
associated with pregnancy risk perception. But women
aged < 18 years had statistically significantly associated
with pregnancy risk perception than women aged 18 to 35
in studies conducted at health and medical centers of
Hamadan City in the west of Iran [26]. This difference might
be due to sampling size difference (421 pregnant women
versus 240 pregnant women), age category difference (15-
43 years versus <35 years), study participant difference (both
nulliparous and multiparous versus only nulliparous), mea-
surement scale differences (Likert scale versus visual analog
scale), and the difference in data collection tools.

5. Conclusion
The pregnant women perceive that they were risky in
developing pregnancy-related complications, and their
consequences were low. Only forty-eight percent of preg-
nant women had good pregnancy risk perception. This is
likely to have implications for medical care and pregnancy
outcomes.
History of obstetric complication and bad obstetric his-
tory was associated with a higher degree of actual risk per-
ception in pregnancy whilst women who knew the death of
pregnant women due to pregnancy complication and knew
at least one pregnancy danger signs were more likely to be
concerned about risk.
5.1. Strength. The strength of this research is that it is the
primary research conducted in Ethiopia and Africa. Besides,
the research measures the outcome variables using the two
components of the health belief model (perceived suscepti-
bility and severity).
5.2. Limitations. This study was conducted within the
clinical area. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to
a woman who failed to attend antenatal care. In addition,
cultural influence of pregnancy risk perception should be
identify using a qualitative research approach, but this
research lacks it.

object oriented paradigms such as inheritance. All concepts
are characterized and described with a set of attributes with
all the details that describe each attribute. For example, Child
concept has birthdate, growth stage, gender, and disorders
attributes which are used to describe a child status.
• Domain Model
Domain model represents the relations between concepts
separated from the control of the expert system. In the
proposed system, nutrition domain models are represented in
many formats which including rules, functions, and tables.
Children nutrition problem solving contains three domain
models. These models are: "Age Stage Model", "Calculate
Needed Calories", and "Determine Meals Schedule".
• Age Stage Model
This model includes Calculate Age and Calculate Age Stage
relations. Calculate age is represented as a function which
calculates the age of the child as a pre-step to determine
his/her growth stage. Calculate age stage is represented as a
relation which determines the growth stage of the child
according to his/her age. The growth stages included in the
prototype is: Toddler, Preschool, Gradeschool, and Teen.
• Calculate Needed Calories
Calculate Needed Calories is represented as a table which
presents the relation between the age stage of the child and
the required amount of daily needed calories according to the
child's activity and gender. The used calculate needed
calories knowledge is shown in table l.
TABLE 1
CALORIES NEEDED EACH DAY
represented as table which determines each food item
calories. Needed Food Group Unit is represented as a set of
rules which drives the suitable needed daily food group unites
according to the child growth stage. Meals schedule is
represented as a set of rules which defines each meal contains
according to the child needed calories and its healthy statues.

• Determined Meals Schedule
Determine Meals Schedule model is considered the main
step as its output is the main system output. This model
presents a healthy diet schedule for the child according to the
calculated calories amount, gender, and the required amount
of each food group for the child. One of the main criteria to
determine the suitable meal for the child is his/her healthy
status such as diabetic children who needs special diet to
avoid any consequences for the disease. It includes four
relations: Determine Food Group, Food Unit Calories,
Needed Food Group Unit, and Meals schedule. The
Determine Food Group is represented as a set of rules which
defines each food group items. There are six food groups
namely: Milk, Protein, Fruit, Vegetable, Bread and cereal,
and Sugar and Oil. The Food Unit Calories relation is
Fig. l: Children Nutrition Inference Structure
INFERENCE KNOWLEDGE
Inference Knowledge layer presents the steps for the
problem-solving which applies the rules of the relations,
functions, and tables which are describes in the domain model
section.
As shown in Fig. 1, the inference structure contains three
inference steps. These steps are: Calculate growth stage,
Calculate feeding requirement and, Determine meal schedule.
The following subsections describe the details of each
inference role in Fig. 1 including its input parameters, output
parameters, with mapping the applied part of the domain
knowledge.
• Calculate Age Stage
The objective of the Calculate Age Stage inference is to
determine the age stage of the child according to his birth
date. This age stage is then taken into consideration in the
next inference step as each age stage has its determined
nutrition requirements.
In addition, other personal

specifications are also considered such as the gender of the
child. Calculate Age Stage inference derives its goal by
applying the Calculate Age function which calculates the age
of the child and a set of Calculate Age Stage rules that are
defined in the Age Stage Model.
• Calculate Feeding Requirements
The objective of Calculate Feeding Requirements inference
is to determine the main feeding requirements for a specific
child according to the determined age stage driven in the
previous inference step with the support of a number of
specifications such as gender, and activity status. The main
feeding requirements are defined by driven the required
amount of calories. These determined requirements are then
taken into consideration in producing the meals schedule for
the child. Calculate Feeding Requirements inference derives
its goal by applying the Calculate Needed Calories table that
is defined in the Feeding Requirements Model.
• Determine Meals Schedule
The objective of Determine Meals Schedule inference is to
determine the main goal of the system which is presenting the
suitable meals schedule for the child according to the child's
feeding requirements with considering the child's health
status of the child is considered as well as the food unites
requirements. The output of Determine Meals Schedule
inference also depends on the knowledge demonstrating the
existing description for each food group that can be part of
the meal. Determine Meals Schedule inference derives its
goal by applying a set of rules in Needed Food Group Unit
and meal schedule that are defined in the Determine Meals
Schedule Model.
TASK KNOWLEDGE
The goal of Task Knowledge layer is to present the control
over all described inferences steps to reach the determined
goal. The task includes three subtasks which are: Calculate
Child Growth Stage, Calculate Child Feeding Requirements,
and Determine Child Meals Schedule. The following presents
the Children Nutrition Task structure.
Task: Child Nutrition,
Task-Definition:
Goal: determine the suitable meals for the child according to his/her
VI.
CASE STUDY
A web application has been developed for the proposed
system. The knowledge base of the proposed children
nutrition expert system is implemented using the Mini
Knowledge Share and Reuse tool (MiniKSR) [13], while the
control of the system and the user interface were
implemented by Visual Basic.Net (Microsoft Visual Studio
2010). We have applied two case studies on the developed
system to determine the system accuracy in generating the
suitable meal. We changed the values of the required
parameters, for example in the health status parameter, one
experiment was applied for a healthy child while the second
was applied for a diabetic child. We then measured the
accuracy of the system by reviewing the output with experts
in the nutrition field who approved the generated nutrition
schedule.
In this section, we will present the steps applied in the
developed system showing the steps of these experiments
with demonstrating the developed user interface in the
presented figures.
In fig. 3, the user enters the required information for the
child, they are the birth day, gender, and activity level, and
the health status (if exists) such as diabetic.
In the first case, the child is a male, was born in 21/3/2010,
and his activity level is moderately, with no health status that
should be considered. According to this inputs, Calculate
Child Growth Stage subtask will call Calculate Age Stage
inference step to drive the child growth stage which is
determined to be preschool. Then, Calculate Child Feeding
Requirements subtask will use the output of the previous
inference step to call Calculate Feeding Requirements
inference step which drives the needed calories based on the
child age stage, gender and activity level. The minimum need
calories is determined by the system to be 1400 and the
maximum is 1600. Now, the Determine Child Meals Schedule
subtask is ready to generate the suitable meal schedule.
The system determines the generated needed food unit from
each food category for the presented case. Then it determines
the daily food items for preschool child as shown in Table 2.

considers all age stages of the child with the target of
providing a suitable daily diet. This daily diet is given
according to determined criteria such as gender, age, health
status. A case study is presented to prove the accuracy and
applicability of the system. However, validating the
knowledge for the proposed system and completing the
knowledge base are two of the main future directions. Since,
the proposed prototype is a first step towards a complete
expert system for a broader target which is providing a whole
nutrition plan for children with explanation facilities and
different varieties of food based on their preferences. We also
aim to include more than one plan for the child status to
provide more varieties considering different situations such as
the family financial level. Moreover, we aim to provide
bilingual interface (English and Arabic) for more population
to the presented system to serve different levels of families
including education level and financial level.
Finally the system determines the meals schedule and
present it to the user, as shown in Fig. 4.

Gestational diabetes mellitus and antenatal
BACKGROUND:
depression are common comorbidities. However, the combined effects of
antenatal depression and diabetes mellitus during pregnancy on fetal
ß-cell function are unknown.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test whether the association of
maternal gestational diabetes mellitus and glucose metabolism with cord
blood C-peptide levels varies with antenatal depression.
STUDY DESIGN: Data on motheFchild pairs (N=5734) from the
Maternal and Infant Health Coh01t Study in Hefei were analyzed.
Gestational diabetes mellitus was diagnosed using the 75-g oral glucose
tolerance test at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. Antenatal depression was
measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale during
midpregnancy and late pregnancy. Cord blood samples were collected at
delivery and tested for C-peptide levels.
RESULTS: A total of 1054 mothers (18.38%) were diagnosed with ges-
tational diabetes mellitus. Gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with
a 5.57 (95% confidence internl, 3.65—7.50) percentile higher cord blood
C-peptide level. This association varied with depression severity: the differen-
ces in cord blood C-peptide percentile for gestational diabetes mellitus vs no
gestational diabetes mellitus were 5.12 (95% confidence interual,
2.81—9.75) for nonantenatal depression, 7.36 (95% confidence interual,
2.85—13.38) for moderate antenatal depression, and 10.06 (95% confi-
dence interual, 4.69—14.8) for severe antenatal depression in midpreg-
nancy. Similar associations stratified by antenatal depression in late
pregnancy were observed. Antenatal depression was significantly positively
correlated with fetal hyperinsulinism in patticipants with gestational diabetes
mellitus but not in patticipants without gestational diabetes mellitus.
CONCLUSION: Antenatal depression, which is related to maternal
hyperglycemia, can aggravate the risk of fetal hyperinsulinism in early life.

Introduction
estational diabetes
mellitus
(GDM), defined as diabetes melli-
tus diagnosed in the second or third tri-
mester of pregnancy that has not been
overt diabetes mellitus before gestation,
is widespread and affects 3.0% to 21.2%
of women worldwide. Maternal hyper-
glycemia stimulates the production of
fetal insulin and is associated with fetal
2,3
hyperinsulinism. Epidemiologic studies
have shown that depression is a com-
mon comorbidity in patients with diabe-
tes mellitus. However, the specific role
of antenatal depression (AD) in the rela-
tionship between GDM and fetal hyper-
insulinism has seldom been assessed.
C-peptide concentration is a more sta-
ble indicator of insulin synthesis than

circulating insulin levels. C-peptide is
released from the pancreatic ß-cells and
secreted in equimolar levels with insu-
lin.5 Therefore, cord blood C-peptide
level can be used as an indicator of fetal
hyperinsulinism. The gestation period is
considered a crucial time for ß-cell
development, and its structure and func-
tion may be altered by an adverse
intrauterine environment. In pregnant
women with GDM, hyperglycemia is
transported to the fetus through the pla-
centa, causing fetal hyperglycemia, which
stimulates the proliferation of fetal islet
cells and increases insulin secretion,
thereby promoting fetal growth and fat
accretion. The impairment of placental
function by placental inflammation,
which is caused by GDM, may directly
induce fetal injury or insult to the islet
9
structures.
Depression is a prevalent central ner-
vous system condition that affects many
10
people with diabetes mellitus.
In a
meta-analysis of 8 studies, AD was
linked to risks of GDM with a 2.08-fold
11
higher incidence than in controls. AD
results in enhanced hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation
and affects the epigenetic status and
genetic expression in the placenta,
which may compromise placental bar-
rier function and influence fetal devel-
12
opment. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no study has examined
whether the association between GDM
and fetal hyperinsulinism varies with
AD.
Given these previously reported
associations, we hypothesized that the
relationship between maternal GDM and
cord blood C-peptide levels would vary
with AD. To test our hypothesis, we
conducted this multicenter, prospective,
large-sample cohort study to examine
the relationship among maternal GDM,
cord blood C-peptide level, and AD.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Our study used data from the Maternal
and Infant Health Cohort Study con-
ducted in Hefei. From March 2015 to
April 2020, 6693 pregnant participants
at 16 to 23 weeks of gestation were
recruited from 3 hospitals in Hefei,

Why was this study conducted?
This study aimed to test whether the association of maternal gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM) and glucose metabolism with cord blood C-peptide levels varies
with antenatal depression (AD).
Key findings
GDM was associated with higher cord blood C-peptide levels and varied by
depression severity in both midpregnancy and late pregnancy. In addition, AD
was significantly positively correlated with fetal hyperinsulinism in participants
with GDM but not in participants without GDM.
What does this add to what is known?
AD, which is related to maternal hyperglycemia, can aggravate the risk of fetal
hyperinsulinism in early life. Thus, psychological factors during pregnancy may
be potentially important targets in the early stages of life for interventions to pre-
vent glucose metabolism disorders in childhood.
China (The First Affiliated Hospital of
Anhui Medical University, Anhui
Women and Child Health Care Hospi-
tal, and The First People's Hospital of
Hefei City). The eligibility criteria were
as follows: participants aged 18 to
44 years at delivery, living in Hefei, sin-
gleton pregnancy conceived without the
use of assisted reproductive technology,
singleton birth, and no major malfor-
mation or death of the fetus or new-
born. The exclusion criteria were as
follows: multiple pregnancies, previous
macrosomia, diabetes mellitus diag-
nosed before pregnancy, participants
with systemic diseases or taking drugs
interfering with glucose homeostasis
before pregnancy, family history of dia-
betes mellitus; use of insulin or oral
hypoglycemic medications, illiteracy,
and communication problems. A total
of 5734 mother-child pairs were ulti-
mately included. The details of the
recruitment of the pregnant participants
are shown in Supplemental Figure 1
All procedures were approved by the
Ethics Committee of Anhui Medical
University (approval number 2015002).
All participants provided written
informed consent before participating.
Study visit
During recruitment, we collected socio-
demographic information from eligible
pregnant participants via face-to-face
interviews using a structured question-
naire. At 24 and 28 weeks of gestation,
2 AJOG MFM November 2023
the participants underwent a 75-g oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT), includ-
ing fasting plasma glucose (FPG),
I-hour plasma glucose (PG), and 2-
hour PG. According to the criteria,
pregnant participants with GDM had
an FPG of 25.1 mmol/L, a I-hour PG
of 210.0 mmol/L, and/or a 2-hour PG
of 28.5 mmol/L. Nursing care is pro-
vided by the attending obstetrician.
Based on the results of the OGTT, fur-
ther recommendations are made for
dietary and lifestyle changes, along with
self-monitoring of blood glucose
(SMBG) by performing fasting, pre-
meal, and postmeal blood glucose mon-
itoring on 2 to 3 days per week. Further
advice on diet and lifestyle modification
and initiation of insulin and/or metfor-
min was individualized based on SMBG
results. If, after undergoing dietary and
exercise therapy for 3 to 7 days, the
patients' fasting or premeal blood glu-
cose level is 25.3 mmol/L, the patients'
2-hour postprandial blood glucose level
is 26.7 mmol/L, or the patients develop
hunger ketosis after adjusting their diet
and the patients' blood glucose level
exceeds the pregnancy standard again
after increasing calorie intake, insulin
treatment should be promptly initiated.
We did not include participants who
were taking any type of medication for
diabetes mellitus or required insulin
treatment during pregnancy.
Fasting maternal venous blood sam-
ples drawn from participants during
midpregnancy (24—28 weeks of gesta-
tion) were used to evaluate maternal
insulin resistance information using the
homeostasis model assessment for insu-
lin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. The
HOMA-IR was calculated as follows:
(glucose x insulin)/22.5. Cord blood
was drawn from the participants during
delivery and used to evaluate the C-pep-
tide level and fetal ß-cell function. The
samples were processed in the same labo-
ratory and stored in the freezer (—800C)
until use. The samples were processed in
the same laboratory and stored in the
freezer (—800C) until analyzed.
The participants were asked to report
their food intake in a face-to-face inter-
view during late pregnancy using a food
frequency questionnaire (FFQ), which
was used to measure habitual dietary
intake in the preceding 3 months. FFQ
development and validation were previ-
13,14
ously documented.
The energy
intake from carbohydrates was calcu-
lated as the consumption frequency
multiplied by the carbohydrate content
of each food item. Information on
maternal glucose levels and birth out-
comes (sex, gestational age, weight,
small for gestational age [SGA], and
large for gestational age [LGA]) was
collected from the patients' medical
records. SGA was defined as a birth-
weight of < 10th percentile for gesta-
tional age, whereas LGA was defined as
a birthweight of >90th percentile for
gestational age.
Ascertainment of antenatal
depression
Maternal antenatal depressive symptoms
were measured using the Edinburgh
Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS)15 at
midpregnancy (24—28 weeks of gesta-
tion) and late pregnancy (32—36 weeks
of gestation) to establish the natural
course of the AD. We used the Chinese
version of the EPDS, which has been
16
translated into more than 50 languages.
The EPDS is a self-reported depression
questionnaire composed of 10 questions
that have been validated for use in the
perinatal period. Having clinically signifi-
cant symptoms of depression was
17,18
defined as an EPDS score of 213.
We defined 3 levels of AD: O to 12 points,


non-AD; 13 to 16 points, moderate
depression; and 217 points, severe
depression. These threshold levels are
consistent with previous research and
have been shown to have high specificity
and a positive predictive value for
depression (for 213 points: 95.7% and
66.7%, respectively; for 217 points:
19,20
99.7% and 92.4%, respectively).
Laboratory measurements
All measurements were performed
according to the manufacturer's
instructions. Serum insulin levels were
determined using a sandwich immuno-
assay (ADVIA Centaur; Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics Inc, Vienna,
Austria). The assay and a sensitivity of
0.5 mU/L, with an intra-assay coeffi-
cient of variation (CV) of 3.3% to 4.6%
and an interassay CV of 2.6% to 5.9%.
The cord blood C-peptide concentra-
tion was measured using Sandhofer's
Electrochemical Luminescence Detec-
tion Kit E601 (Manheim, Germany) fol-
lowing the manufacturer's instructions.
The intra- and interassay coefficients of
variation were both < 10%.
Statistical analysis
The baseline characteristics of the 5734
mother-child pairs included in this
study were compared. The data were
analyzed and are shown as counts and
percentages for categorical variables
and as mean (standard deviation [SD])
for continuous variables. We reflect the
level of C-peptide in percentiles, which
not only focuses on the actual value but
also comprehensively reflects the
changes in C-peptide levels. Linear
models were used to estimate the associ-
ation between GDM and cord blood C-
peptide percentile. Interaction analysis
was performed to investigate the inter-
action between GDM and cord blood
C-peptide levels, and the potential effect
modifier. We examined whether the
maternal GDM-cord blood C-peptide
association varied with AD. We visual-
ized the associations between glucose
levels and HOMA-IR and cord blood
C-peptide percentile by group and AD
severity using a fractional polynomial
prediction plot. Similarly, we visualized
the associations between AD score and
fetal hyperinsulinemia (cord blood C-
peptide >90th percentile) by maternal
GDM using the same method.
Confounding was defined as covari-
ates associated with exposure (maternal
GDM) and outcome (cord blood C-
peptide) but not on the potential causal
pathway. We adjusted for variables,
including field center, maternal age at
delivery, prepregnancy body mass index
(BMI), educational level, household
income, maternal alcohol consumption,
carbohydrate intake, mode of delivery,
child sex (male or female), and preterm
birth (yes or no).
All analyses using SPSS software (ver-
Sion 26.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk,
NY) were 2-sided with P values of <.05
considered statistically significant.
Results
The
Table
presents the overall charac-
teristics of the mother-child pairs,
GDM, and AD scores. The mean±SD
age at delivery was 29.2±4.3 years; of
the participants, 2184 (38.1%) were
multiparas, and 1213 (21.2%) were
overweight or obese. Of the children,
2718 (47.4%) were female, and 190
(3.3%) were born before term.
Supple-
mental Table 1 shows the characteristics
of the mother-child pairs according to
GDM, and Table S2 shows the charac-
teristics of the 3 AD severity levels in
midpregnancy and late pregnancy.
Compared with participants without
GDM, participants with GDM had
lower educational levels (14.3% vs
16.3%), were more likely multiparas
(37.1% vs 42.7%), and were more likely
overweight or obese (19.9% vs 36.3%).
Mean difference in cord blood C-
peptide percentile in participants
with vs without gestational diabetes
mellitus
Participants with GDM had a 5.57 (95%
confidence interval [CI], 3.65—7.50)
percentile higher C-peptide level than
participants without GDM after the
adjustment for confounders (Figure 1).
This association did not vary by mater-
nal age at delivery, prepregnancy BMI,
gestational weight gain, child sex, pre-
term birth, SGA, and LGA. However,
the association between GDM and

cord blood C-peptide percentile varied
with AD (P=.003 for interaction
between GDM and AD on cord blood
C-peptide).
Association between gestational
diabetes mellitus and cord blood
C-peptide level overall and by
antenatal depression severity
Participants with GDM had a 26%
higher risk of fetal hyperinsulinemia
than participants without GDM
(Supplemental Table 3). By AD severity,
the adjusted difference in C-peptide
percentile in participants with GDM vs
participants without GDM was 5.12
(95% Cl, 2.81-9.75) for non-AD, 7.36
(95% CI, 2.85—13.38) for moderate AD,
and 10.06 (95% CI, 4.69—14.8) for
severe AD in midpregnancy and 5.06
(95% Cl, 2.69-9.79) for non-AD, 8.83
(95% CI, 4.76—14.97) for moderate AD,
and 11.28 (95% Cl, 7.65—16.54) for
severe AD in late pregnancy (Figure 2
Overall, the risk of elevated levels of
GDM and cord blood C-peptide during
pregnancy was 1.07 (95% CI, 0.83
—1.39) for participants who did not
experience AD, whereas it increased to
2.25 (95% CI, 1.44—3.51) for those who
experienced AD (Supplemental Table 3)
The association between maternal PG
levels and HOMA-IR and cord blood
C-peptide percentiles varied according
to AD severity. As AD severity
increased, cord blood C-peptide levels
increased (Supplemental Figure 2
In
addition, glycemic control did not differ
between AD and non-AD groups
(Supplemental Table 4).
Association between fetal
hyperinsulinism and Edinburgh

We further examined the association
between fetal hyperinsulinism and AD
severity in participants with or without
GDM (

GDM, the association between a higher
EPDS score and fetal hyperinsulinism
showed a generally increasing trend
with a higher EPDS score. The odds
ratios (ORS) for a higher EPDS score
and fetal hyperinsulinism were 0.85 to

Discussion
Principal findings
In this prospective birth cohort study,
the offspring of mothers with GDM had
higher cord blood C-peptide levels,
which were further increased in the pres-
ence of AD. Maternal glucose metabo-
lism, including FPG, I-hour postprandial
PG, 2-hour postprandial PG, and
HOMA-IR, all had nonlinear relation-
ships with cord blood C-peptide levels,
4 AJOG MFM November 2023
and the association became stronger
with increasing AD severity. In addition,
AD was associated with higher cord
blood C-peptide levels in pregnant par-
ticipants with GDM. However, no signif-
icant association was observed among
participants without GDM. This study
reported the function of maternal mental
health factors in the intergenerational
transmission of metabolic disorders.
Results and clinical and research
implications
Mounting evidence suggests that GDM
predisposes the offspring to metabolic
disorders in later life independent
of maternal obesity or genetic
21,22
background.
Previous studies dem-
onstrated a continuous association
between maternal glucose levels and the
risk of higher cord PG levels and fetal
hyperinsulinemia (clinical diagnosis of
cord blood C-peptide level of >90th
23,24
percentile).
The
International
Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy
Outcome study demonstrated that cord
blood C-peptide level was negatively
associated with childhood insulin sensi-
tivity and positively associated with an
25
increased risk of newborn adiposity.
Our results are in line with previous
findings of GDM,26 which showed a
consistently positive
relationship
between I-hour PG and 2-hour PG and
cord blood C-peptide level. Although
the relationship between GDM and
cord blood C-peptide was demonstrated
previously, differences in this associa-
tion between populations have not been
reported. Here, we performed a stratifi-
cation analysis and found that the posi-
tive association of cord blood C-peptide
and GDM seems stronger in partici-
pants with a prepregnancy BMI of 224

investigation given previous reports
that prepregnancy BMI contributes to
the body fat percentage and total fat

mass of newborns.
Depression affects 10% to 15% of
pregnant participants during the peri-
natal period.28 We found that the asso-
ciations between maternal FPG, I-hour
PG, 2-hour PG, and HOMA-IR during
pregnancy and cord blood C-peptide
levels were stronger in pregnant partici-
pants with AD vs pregnant participants
without AD. Prenatal depression may
influence glucose control, which influ-
ences the intrauterine milieu. Here, we
found no significant difference in glyce-
mic control between the groups with
and without AD. AD may modify the
association between GDM and high
cord blood C-peptide levels; however,
the underlying mechanism remains
unknown. The adverse intrauterine
environment during human pregnancy
strongly affects the fetoplacental vascu-
29
lar morphology. The available evi-
dence suggests that maternal glucose is
passively transferred from the mother
30
to the fetus across the placenta.
Hyperglycemia may stimulate placental
cells, which buffer excess maternal glu-
cose or increase vascular resistance,
leading to changes in various key mole-
cules, including gene expression,
inflammatory cytokines, and placental
31,32
endothelial dysfunction.
This could
result in more maternal glucose enter-
ing the fetal circulation, which causes
ß-cell hyperplasia in the fetus and over-
stimulates the release of insulin from
2
the fetal pancreas.
Multiple studies have revealed an
association between depression and
33,34
increased HPA axis activation.
It is
possible that, after heightened maternal
stress, the maternal-fetal interface can
be disrupted by placental immune sen-
sitization, which affects fetal HPA axis
development. Nevertheless, disruption
of the HPA axis may contribute to pla-
35
cental oxidative stress.

epigenetic status or expression of genes
encoding the II-hydroxysteroid dehy-
drogenase type 2 enzyme in the pla-
centa, which can compromise placental
36
barrier function. We speculate that
AD aggravates the injury to the placen-
tal endothelium and exacerbates the
intergenerational transmission of meta-
bolic disorders. In addition, elevations
in maternal glucose levels may be asso-
ciated with maternal catecholamine ele-
vations with associated maternal mood
dysfunction. This further explains the
increased cord blood C-peptide levels in
pregnant participants with GDM with
AD.
In addition, positive associations
were observed between AD and cord
blood C-peptide levels. However, previ-
ous studies revealed inconsistent con-
clusions regarding the relationship
between depression and C-peptide lev-
37
els in nonpregnant populations. How-
ever, few studies have focused on the
association between AD and cord blood
C-peptide levels. The current study may
provide evidence of the effect of mater-
nal emotional problems on health in
early life. Interestingly, after analyses
stratified for GDM, we observed a posi-
tive association between fetal hyperin-
sulinemia and AD in pregnant
participants with GDM, whereas no
association was observed in pregnant
participants without GDM, despite the
adjustment for potential confounders.
Our study extended previous work by
investigating the combined effects of
GDM and AD on fetal hyperinsuline-
mia, revealing that GDM comorbid
depression may be "double hits" to the
developing fetal ß-cell function. A
potential explanation for our results
might be that, in maternal hyperglyce-
mia, which always causes placental
endothelial dysfunction, molecular sub-
strates mediated by depression pass
through the placenta more easily, which
can affect the fetal islets. However, fur-
ther research is required to understand
this transport process.
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths. First, it
was based on a birth cohort with a rela-
tively large population and rich
questionnaire data used to assess poten-
tial confounding factors. Second, this
was the first study to reveal the role of
psychological factors during pregnancy
in the intergenerational transmission of
metabolic disorders. In particular, we
analyzed AD in midpregnancy and late
pregnancy simultaneously rather than
at a single point in time. Finally, sensi-
tivity analyses were performed using
subgroup analyses to increase the reli-
ability of our interpretations. Fourth, in
addition to conducting subgroup and
sensitivity analyses to further evaluate
the association, we performed a dose-
response analysis to fully understand
this relationship.
This study has several limitations.
First, it did not obtain a clinical diagno-
sis of AD; thus, outcome misclassifica-
tion was possible. However, a validated
screening scale, which has been used in
multiple studies in China, was used for
17,38
the diagnosis.
Second, we cannot
account for the contributions of unmea-
sured factors to emotional changes in
depression over time, such as stress and
anxiety, that are caused by work or
changing attitudes toward pregnancy
outcomes. Third, although we have
excluded pregnant participants with
abnormal blood glucose control, we are
still unable to obtain dynamic blood
glucose readings for further compari-
son. Therefore, we cannot rule out the
effect of differences in blood glucose
control. This limitation could poten-
tially affect the ability to evaluate the
effect of GDM on fetal hyperinsulinism
under different blood glucose fluctua-
tion conditions. Fourth, because the
study design was observational, no
causal inference could be drawn, and
only associations could be described.
Finally, some residual confounding fac-
tors may exist, despite the adjustment
for the most important ones.
Conclusions
AD enhanced the association between
GDM and cord blood C-peptide levels
and increased the risk of hyperinsuline-
mia in the offspring of mothers with
GDM. These results expand our under-
standing of the role of psychological
factors during pregnancy in the
Original Research
intergenerational transmission of meta-
bolic disorders. Psychological factors
during pregnancy may be potentially
important targets in the early stages of
life for interventions to prevent glucose
metabolism disorders in childhood.
Further clinical research and prospec-
tive birth cohort studies are needed to
validate these findings.

BACKGROUND: In nonpregnant populations, sodium intake has been
associated with the development of chronic hypertension, and sodium
restriction has been identified as a strategy to reduce blood pressure.
Data regarding the relationship between sodium intake and the develop-
ment of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are limited and conflicting.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the association between daily
periconceptional sodium intake and the risk of hypalensive disorders of
pregnancy.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of the prospective Nullip-
arous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-To-Be study. Individu-
als with nonanomalous, singleton pregnancies who completed food frequency
questionnaires with recorded sodium intake in the 3 months before pregnancy
were included in the analysis. Individuals whose pregnancies did not progress
beyond 20 weeks of gestation were excluded from the analysis. Sodium
intake was categorized as low (<2 g per day), medium (2 to <3 g per day),
or high (23 g per day), based on thresholds used in the nonpregnant popula-
tion. The primary outcome was the development of a new-onset hypertensive
disorder of pregnancy, including gestational hypettension; preeclampsia;
hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome; superim-
posed preeclampsia; or eclampsia. Bivariable analyses were performed using
Kruskal-Wallis and chi-square tests. Poisson regression was used to estimate
adjusted incidence risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals after controlling
for potentially confounding factors.
RESULTS: Among 7458 individuals included in this analysis, 2336
(31 reported low sodium intake, 2792 (37%) repotted medium sodium
intake, and 2330 (31 %) reported high sodium intake. Individuals with high
sodium intake were more likely to have chronic hypertension, to use
tobacco, and to be living with obesity. The risk of developing a hyperten-
Sive disorder of pregnancy was similar among groups (medium vs low
adjusted incidence risk ratio: 1.10[95% confidence interval, 0.94—1.28];
high vs low adjusted incidence risk ratio: 1.17 [95% confidence interval,
1.00—1.37]). There was no difference in neonatal outcomes by sodium
intake, including preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age neonate, and
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit.
CONCLUSION: Sodium intake was not associated with the risk of
developing a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. This lack of association
contrasts with that between sodium intake and hypertension in the non-
pregnant state and may reflect differences in the pathophysiology underly-
ing pregnancy- vs non—pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.

Introduction
ypertensive disorders of pregnancy
(HDPs) are responsible for 10% to
15% of maternal deaths worldwide. In
addition, maternal morbidity associated
with these disorders, including maternal
stroke, seizure, and renal failure, can be
profound. These conditions are associated
with an increased risk of placental abrup-
tion, preterm birth, fetal growth restric-
tion, and perinatal mortality. Although
the incidence of HDPs continues to rise,
doubling between 2007 and 2019, with
particular acceleration after 2014,

interventions to prevent and treat these
3
disorders remain limited.
Outside of pregnancy, there is consid-
erable evidence to support the relation-
ship between sodium intake and both the
development and control of chronic
hypertension. A meta-analysis of 11
cohort studies, published in 2022, identi-
fied a linear relationship between sodium
intake and the risk of hypertension, with
an excess risk of hypertension noted with
10
an intake of 23 g of sodium per day.
An earlier systematic review and meta-
analysis of 34 trials, including 3230 partic-
ipants, found that a modest reduction in
sodium intake for 24 weeks was associ-
ated with significant decreases in blood
pressure among both individuals with
hypertension and individuals with normal
5
blood pressure.
Data regarding the relationship
between sodium intake and HDPs
have been less conclusive. For example,
although increased salinity of drinking
water has been associated with an
11
increased risk of developing HDPs,
sodium restriction during pregnancy
has not been shown to decrease the
12
frequency of HDPs. There are few
data available regarding the relationship
between periconceptional sodium intake
and the development of HDPs. Given
the importance of preventing the devel-
opment of HDPs, this study aimed to
investigate the relationship between
periconceptional sodium intake and the
development of HDP, with the goal of
better understanding sodium intake as a
potentially modifiable risk factor.

Why was this study conducted?
This study aimed to investigate the association between periconceptional sodium
intake and the development of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDPs).
Key findings
Periconceptional sodium intake was not associated with the development of
HDPs.
What does this add to what is known?
Study findings indicate that the assessment of periconceptional sodium intake
should not inform counseling regarding the risk of HDPs and that decreasing
sodium intake is unlikely to be a successful strategy for reducing the risk of
hypertensive disorder.
Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute
of Child Health and Human Develop-
ment and the National Institutes of
Health Office of Research on Women's
Health. It included 8 clinical research cen-
ters and 16 subsites in the United States
and enrolled 10,038 nulliparous individu-
als with singleton pregnancies between
2010 and 2013. The study included 4 vis-
its, occurring between 6 0/7 weeks of ges-
tation and delivery, during which data
were collected through interviews, ques-
tionnaires, physical examination, ultra-
sound assessment, and biologic samples.
Approval was granted by the institutional
review boards at each site before the com-
mencement of the study. Further details
of the nuMoM2b study have been
13
described previously.
Information about sodium intake was
collected using the modified Block 2005
Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ).
The FFQ is a validated semiquantitative
assessment of approximately 120 food
and beverage items, which investigates
how often an individual consumes a given
food and estimates the quantity of each
14—16
food consumed. The food list was
derived from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Study 1999—2002
dietary recall data, whereas the nutrient
database was drawn from the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture Food and Nutrient
Database for Dietary Studies (version
1.0). The FFQ was administered at the
first visit, which occurred between 6 0/7
and 13 6/7 weeks of gestation, at which
point participants were asked to report
their intake for 3 months before concep-
tion. Obstetric and neonatal outcomes,
2 AJOG MFM November 2023
along with postpartum information, were
abstracted from the medical record by
13
trained research staff after delivery.
We limited our analyses to those
individuals who completed the FFQ and
provided sodium intake information.
We excluded all those whose pregnan-
Cies were complicated by fetal anomalies
or whose pregnancies did not progress
beyond 20 weeks of gestation. Those
with chronic hypertension were
included. Sodium intake was catego-
rized as low (<2 g per day), medium (2
to <3 g per day), or high (23 g per day).
These categories were selected on the
basis of the "Effects on Blood Pressure
of Reduced Dietary Sodium and the
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyperten-
Sion Diet" study, which defined high
sodium intake as 150 mmol per day
(equivalent to 3.45 g/d), intermediate
sodium intake as 100 mmol per day
(equivalent to 2.30 g/d), and low
sodium intake as 50 mmol per day
(equivalent to 1.15 g/d).4 Similar thresh-
olds are used by the World Health
Organization, which recommends that
sodium intake be limited to 2 g/d, and
the Food and Drug Administration,
which seeks to lower the average
sodium intake in the United States to
17,18
<3 g/d.
The primary outcome was the develop-
ment of a new-onset HDP, including pre-
eclampsia; hemolysis, elevated liver
enzymes, and low platelet count syn-
drome; superimposed preeclampsia on
chronic hypertension; eclampsia; or ante-
partum gestational hypertension. Patients
with blood pressure elevations without
proteinuria or severe features and isolated
to the intrapartum or postpartum period
(after admission to the labor and delivery
unit) were excluded because of concern
for pain affecting blood pressure readings.
A composite maternal morbidity out-
come that encompassed 21 of the follow-
ing variables—eclampsia,
stroke,
pulmonary edema, kidney injury (defined
as a creatinine level of > 1.1), and liver
hematoma or rupture—was evaluated as
a secondary outcome. Assessed neonatal
outcomes included birthweight, small for
gestational age (SGA; defined as a birth-
weight of < 10th or <3rd percentile
according to the Alexander standard),
preterm birth before 37 weeks of gesta-
tion, admission to the neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU), and intrauterine fetal
demise.
The Kruskal-Wallis test and chi-
square tests were used to compare base-
line characteristics among the 3 groups.
The association between sodium intake
and the risk of HDPs was estimated by
calculating the adjusted incidence risk
ratios (alRRs) with 95% confidence
intervals (CIS) using Poisson regression.
The low sodium intake group served as
the reference for all comparisons. Mod-
els were adjusted for maternal age, body
mass index (BMI), tobacco use, and dia-
betes mellitus. These confounding vari-
ables were identified a priori based on a
previously established association with
the outcomes of interest. All analyses
were performed using Stata (version 17;
StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Among 10,038 individuals enrolled in
the nuMoM2b cohort, 8259 completed
FFQs. After application of the exclusion
criteria, 7458 individuals were included
in the analysis (Figure). There were
2336 individuals (31%) who reported
low sodium intake, 2792 individuals
(37%) who reported medium sodium
intake, and 2330 individuals (31%) who
reported high sodium intake. The mean
sodium intake was 2.75 g (standard
deviation [SD], 0.57) overall, with
1.52 g (SD, 0.36) ingested in the low
sodium intake group, 2.46 g (SD, 0.28)
in the medium sodium intake group,

and 4.32 g (SD, 1.89) in the high sodium
intake group.
Baseline characteristics, including
age, BMI, self-reported race and ethnic-
ity, and tobacco use, differed signifi-
cantly among groups (Table 1).
Individuals with medium sodium intake
were slightly older than those in the
other 2 groups. Those in the high
sodium intake groups were more likely
to have prepregnancy obesity (23.9%)
than those in the medium sodium
group (19.6%) and the low sodium
group (20.3%). Moreover, high sodium
intake was more frequently reported by
individuals who self-identified as non-
Hispanic Black or Hispanic. Tobacco
use was nearly 2-fold higher in the high
sodium intake group (18.1%) than the
other groups (9.5% of the low sodium
intake group and 9.1% of the medium
sodium intake group), and chronic
hypertension was more frequent in the
low and the high sodium intake groups
(2.1% and 3.2%, respectively) than in
the medium sodium intake group
(1.7%).
The frequency of HDPs in the cohort
ranged from 12.6% in the low sodium
intake group to 15.6% in the high
sodium intake group (Table 2
). After
adjustment for potential confounding
factors, the risk of developing an HDP
was similar among groups (medium vs
low alRR: 1.10 [95% Cl, 0.94—1.28];
high vs low alRR: 1.17 [95% CI, 1.00
—1.37]). The proportion of individuals
who developed the composite maternal
morbidity outcome was low, and thus,
multivariable analyses were not per-
formed. Frequencies did not differ
significantly among groups (0.5% in the
low sodium intake group, 0.5% in the
medium sodium intake group, and 0.9%
in the high sodium intake group;
P=.IO).
In addition, neonatal outcomes,
including median birthweight, and the
frequencies of SGA birthweight, pre-
term birth, admission to the NICU, and
group
intrauterine fetal demise, were similar
among groups (Table 3).
Discussion
Principal findings
In this secondary analysis of a large pro-
spective cohort study in the United
States, which included the collection of
detailed periconceptional dietary data
via a validated questionnaire, we found
that self-reported periconceptional
sodium intake categorized based on
commonly recommended guidelines
was not associated with a risk of the
development of HDPs. In addition, the
risk of adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes did not differ with the
reported amount of sodium intake.
Results
There is evidence to support a low salt
diet as an intervention to reduce hyper-
tension in nonpregnant populations
In addition, sodium restriction has been
used historically to treat preeclampsia;

Our study, which examines reported
sodium intake among several thousand
individuals, confirms the lack of rela-
tionship suggested by previous work
and extends findings from another
study of nuMoM2b data. Petersen et
21
al used the FFQ data from the
nuMoM2b cohort to analyze the rela-
tionship between different dietary
compositions and adverse pregnancy
outcomes. Although they analyzed
sodium intake as one of their dietary
exposures, it was assessed differently
than in our analysis. Specifically, it was
evaluated in the context of dietary den-
sity (standard unit per 1000 kilocalo-
ries) and scored as one of the
components of the Healthy Eating
Index 2010. In addition, Petersen's
work focused on preeclampsia specifi-
cally. In contrast, we analyzed sodium
intake by daily quantity and analyzed
the association with all new-onset
HDPs. Our data expand this extant
body of literature, suggesting that there
is also no association between pericon-
ceptional sodium intake and the devel-
opment of HDPs. Of note, there was an
association between sodium intake and
HDPs before the adjustment for con-
founding variables; it is possible that
individuals have concomitant dietary
habits, such as high sugar and high salt
intake, that alter their risk of multiple
comorbidities.
Our findings contrast with those of

An explainable machine
learning-based clinical decision
support system for prediction
of gestational diabetes mellitus
Yuhan Dul, Anthony R. Rafferty2, Fionnuala M. McAuliffe2, Lan Weil & Catherine Mooney
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM), a common pregnancy complication associated with many
maternal and neonatal consequences, is increased in mothers with overweight and obesity.
Interventions initiated early in pregnancy can reduce the rate of GDM in these women, however,
untargeted interventions can be costly and time-consuming. We have developed an explainable
machine learning-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) to identify at-risk women in need
of targeted pregnancy intervention. Maternal characteristics and blood biomarkers at baseline from
the PEARS study were used. After appropriate data preparation, synthetic minority oversampling
technique and feature selection, five machine learning algorithms were applied with five-fold cross-
validated grid search optimising the balanced accuracy. Our models were explained with Shapley
additive explanations to increase the trustworthiness and acceptability of the system. We developed
multiple models for different use cases: theoretical (AUC-PR 0.485, AUC-ROC 0.792), GDM screening
during a normal antenatal visit (AUC-PR 0.208, AUC-ROC 0.659), and remote GDM risk assessment
(AUC-PR 0.199, AUC-ROC 0.656). Our models have been implemented as a web server that is publicly
available for academic Use. Our explainable CDSS demonstrates the potential to assist clinicians in
screening at risk patients who may benefit from early pregnancy GDM prevention strategies.
Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) is generally defined as "glucose intolerance of varying degrees of severity
with onset or first recognition during pregnancy"l. The risk of GDM is increased with overweight and obesity2,
of which the global prevalence has increased substantially in the past decades3. GDM increases the risk of many
maternal and neonatal complications such as gestational hypertension, polyhydramnios, Caesarean birth, prema-
ture delivery, large for gestational age, and neonatal macrosomia, intensive care unit admission, hypoglycaemia
and respiratory distress4. Moreover, GDM may predispose to long-term sequelae for both mother and child
including metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus5, thus increasing later life chronic disease.
Research shows that interventions initiated early in pregnancy can reduce the rate of GDM in pregnant
women with overweight and obesity6-8. However, applying interventions in every instance can be costly and time-
consuming. A clinical decision support system (CDSS) based on machine learning can be helpful in providing
a powerful and objective computerised tool to assist clinicians identify women at risk of GDM. It would largely
reduce the time and cost by allowing targeted intervention. The CDSS has great potential in clinical settings,
especially under the circumstance that many clinicians have turned to telemedicine to maintain social distancing
during the COVID- 19 pandemic9.
CDSSs have a great potential to improve healthcare delivery, though literature on their successful adoption,
especially that of machine learning-based CDSSs, is scarce. Shortliffe and Sepålveda10 indicated that aside from
system accuracy, effciency and usability are important for a CDSS to be accepted and integrated into clinical
workflow. A CDSS should be time-saving, intuitive and simple to use in order to obtain system outputs easily
while juggling a heavy clinical workload. They also pointed out that black-boxes are not acceptable for CDSSs.
This is inline with Antoniadi et al.ll who indicated that explainability is a critical component for a CDSS to be
adopted in practical use effectively. A famous example by Caruana et al.12 shows that a machine learning-based
system can reflect the pattern in the training data but be inconsistent with medical knowledge and thus does not
translate to clinical practice. Their system predicted that patients who had a history of asthma had a lower risk

of dying from pneumonia than the general population. This is because patients who had asthma and presented
with pneumonia usually receive aggressive care which lowers their risk. Even though the system truly captured
the training data, it would be problematic if adopted in clinical practice without understanding why the model
behaved this way. Such problems can be resolved using Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). Many benefits
have been reported in the use of XAI in CDSS, including enhancing decision confidence, generating the hypoth
esis about causality, and increasing acceptability and trustworthiness of the system. Nevertheless, there is an
overall distinct lack of the application of XAI in CDSSs in the published literaturell
We aim to apply machine learning to develop a CDSS that predicts the risk of GDM in a high risk group
of women with overweight and obesity to identify those who may benefit from prevention strategies early in
pregnancy. We performed modeling on baseline maternal characteristics and blood biomarkers collected in the
Pregnancy Exercise and Nutrition with smart phone application support (PEARS) study. Multiple probabilistic
prediction models incorporating different feature subsets were developed for different use cases, including theo-
retical, routine antenatal and remote risk assessment. Intelligent optimization algorithms were not considered in
13-16
this work . Clinical usability was taken into account throughout the modeling process. Moreover, we applied
Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), a game theoretic XAI method, to explain the models and thus make them
more acceptable and trustworthy for clinicians. The models were implemented as a web server-based CDSS that
is open for academic use. Our CDSS has a potential to help clinicians identify women at risk of GDM in early
pregnancy.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section "Related work" reviewed previous research done in the
related field. The data, modeling process and explanation method used in this research are introduced in Sec-
tion "Methods". Section "Results" describes our final models and their performance on white and non-white
populations, as well as the implementation of a CDSS prototype and a case study. The discussion of our findings
are presented in Section "Discussion". Section "Conclusion" concludes this paper.
Related work
We comprehensively reviewed original research articles published between 1 Jan 2015 and 1 Dec 2021 on the use
of machine learning to predict the risk of GDM. The search was performed on PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus,
IEEE and ACM. The search terms are: "machine learning", "gestational diabetes mellitus" and "risk prediction".
A total of nine papers were deemed relevant and summarized in Table 1.
Given the prevalence of GDM, there are usually many more non-GDM cases than GDM cases leading to
unbalanced datasets. Some of the studies have not successfully addressed this class imbalance problem which may
lead to the development of models that perform well for the majority class (non-GDM) only, i.e. high specificity
17,24
but low sensitivity . In addition, most models have not been designed for use in a clinical setting. All models
focused on GDM prediction in general pregnant women, whereas prediction in a high-risk group would allow
for more cost-effective GDM screening which would be more suitable for clinical use. Only Artzi et al.20 and
Wu et al.24 considered the impact of the number or accessibility of features included on the clinical usability of
the models in the modeling process. Additionally, Artzi et al.20 is the only group of researchers who included
the explainability in the model design. However, they did not provide justification of why their model made a
specific prediction for an instance (local interpretation). Moreover, due to the geographic area where maternal
data were collected, all models are trained on data from women who are predominantly from the same ethnic
group. There is a lack of studies that investigate the differences that might be associated with different cultural
or ethnic backgrounds in GDM prediction. Additionally, there is a lack of implementation of the models into
an open-access web server or application which allows for benchmarking or validation. There is a randomised
controlled trial designed to screen for high-risk women using the model by Wu et al.24 and assess the effect of
an individualised nutritional intervention to prevent GDM in this population26, but the model is not publicly
available for academic use.

Methods
Study design and data. This research is a secondary analysis of the Pregnancy Exercise and Nutrition with
smart phone application support (PEARS) study (ISRCTN29316280), a randomised controlled trial carried out
at the National Maternity Hospital (NMH), Dublin, Ireland between 2013 and 201627. The study was approved
by ethical committee of National Maternity Hospital. All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant
guidelines and regulations.
The PEARS study recruited 565 women with singleton pregnancy and a body mass index (BMI) 25-39.9 kg/m2
at IO- 15 weeks gestation to investigate the prevention of GDM using a behavioural antenatal lifestyle intervention
supported by a smartphone application in pregnancies complicated by overweight and obesity. Maternal written
informed consent was acquired at study enrolment. The PEARS participants were stratified by BMI and randomly
assigned into control (standard antenatal care) and intervention (additional dietary and physical activity advice
with reinforcement using mHealth technology) groups. During the PEARS study, a variety of data were collected
from these participants, including maternal characteristics, blood biomarkers, ultrasound measurements, food
intake, exercise and lifestyle behaviors, maternal and neonatal outcomes. GDM was diagnosed according to the
International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria28 at approximately
28 weeks gestation.
In this research, we excluded PEARS participants who dropped out or were excluded from the PEARS study,
and those without available GDM diagnostics. As a result, 484 PEARS participants were included. Because the
PEARS study did not find any significant difference between the incidence of GDM in the control and interven-
tion group, we did not consider the impact of the PEARS intervention in this research.
As we aimed to predict GDM in early pregnancy, the descriptive features used are clinical data collected at
the PEARS randomisation visit (14.91±1.66 weeks gestation, also referred to as the baseline). These features are
maternal anthropometry, demographic characteristics, family history and blood biomarkers. They are described
in Table 2.
Figure 1 shows the workflow overview of this research.
Data preparation. Many features included in this research have missing values, as shown in Fig. 2a. We
dropped features with greater than 30% missing values: complement component 3 (C3), C-reactive protein
(CRP), leptin and adiponectin. The missing values in the remaining features were imputed. Several imputation
methods were considered: median or mean for numerical features and mode for categorical features, k-Nearest
Neighbors (kNN) imputation, and iterative imputation. In order to select the best imputation method for our
dataset, we extracted the 313 complete cases of the dataset and generated missing values in these cases fol-
lowing the same missing pattern in the entire dataset. This is done by randomly selecting instances from the
entire dataset and copying the feature missingness in these instances into the complete cases. Then we imputed
these generated missing values using the candidate imputation methods and calculated the mean absolute error
(MAE) between the imputed and true values after a min-max scaler. As shown in Fig. 2b, mean/mode impu-
tation achieved the highest MAE, followed by median/mode imputation and kNN imputation with different
parameters. Iterative imputation achieved the lowest MAE, showing that this method is able to generate imputed
values closest to the real values for this dataset. Therefore, we applied the iterative imputation to impute the miss-
ing values in the dataset.
90.70% of the participants included were white, therefore, participants from other ethnic origins were held
out as an independent cross-cultural/ethnic test set. After that, 75% of the white participants in the dataset,
stratified by the GDM diagnosis, were randomly selected as the training set. The remaining 25% was used as an
independent test set.
Feature selection. First of all, we aimed to remove redundant features to avoid the "curse of dimension-
ality"29 and reduce the number of inputs required to use the models in a clinical setting. Figure 3 shows the
Pearson correlation between features. We defined redundant features as those with correlation greater than 0.6.
As a result, maternal weight, BMI and mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), insulin and C-peptide, and total
cholesterol and Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were deemed to be redundant. This is consistent
with the medical knowledge: weight, BMI and MUAC are all anthropometric measurements that provide assess-
ment of nutritional status, and BMI is derived from height and weight. Insulin and C-peptide are released from
the pancreas at the same time and the same rate. LDL cholesterol is calculated from total cholesterol, High-Den-
sity Lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. To reduce feature redundancy, we removed features with
higher percentage of missing values prior to imputation (see Fig. 2a) to minimise the impact of imputation and
ensure the credibility of data. As a result, MUAC and C-peptide are removed. The remaining redundant features
that have the same level of missing values are: weight and BMI, and LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol. "Ihe
latter of each pair is calculated from the former. Among them, we removed derived features (BMI, LDL choles-
terol) and kept the original features (weight, total cholesterol) to save computational time.
Moreover, we conducted the feature selection process in close collaboration with clinical experts. In the
existing literature, there is conflicting evidence reporting both positive and negative relationships with GDM
and maternal education level, a indicator of socioeconomic status30. In our dataset, the average education level
is higher in GDM participants than non-GDM participants, which can be explained by the positive relationship
between maternal age and education. This is consistent with the indirect effect of maternal education on GDM
through high pre-pregnancy BMI and older age that Bertolotto et al.31 suggested based on data collected in Italy.
However, a cohort study in the Netherlands suggests low-educated women have an increased risk of GDM32
In order for our modeling results to be generalisable among different populations, and to avoid confusion in a
clinical setting, we removed education in consultation with clinical experts.

Table 2. Descriptive features for gestational diabetes mellitus prediction.
In order to develop a clinically usable CDSS, we aimed to develop multiple models for different use cases.
Model 1 was designed to be theoretical and feature-agnostic, where all included features were considered candi-
dates and acts as a baseline. Model 2 was designed to be more usable and to fit into clinical routine easily. Fasting
blood biomarkers (fasting glucose, insulin, C-peptide, lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycer-
ides)) were excluded, because pregnant women do not normally attend an antenatal visit fasted and fasting blood
biomarkers are not routinely assessed. Also, excluding these features can reduce the cost for a GDM prediction.
Pobal HP deprivation index, a measurement of the women's socioeconomic status based on the geographical
area of their residence, was excluded because it is only available in Ireland and it limits the applicability of our
model to other regions. Model 3 was designed to work in remote settings without a hospital visit, so all features
that cannot be recalled or measured outside of a clinical setting were excluded. In addition to features removed
in Model 2, for example, all blood biomarkers. Also, Pobal HP deprivation index was excluded. All included
features for each model are further selected during cross-validation (described in Section "Modeling").
Modeling. We adopted several machine learning algorithms, namely logistic regression, random forest,
support vector machine (SVM), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) for

data modeling. In our dataset, 13.90% (61) of white women were diagnosed with GDM at approximately 28
gestational weeks, which means the dataset is highly unbalanced. For each model, we applied sequential steps
of synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), feature selection by the highest ANOVA F-values and
machine learning with each algorithm on the training set in a pipeline. The number of nearest neighbors used
to construct synthetical samples in SMOTE is set to three. The number of top features to select (from one to the
total number of candidate features) as well as hyper-parameters for each algorithm were tuned, using balanced
accuracy as the evaluation metric, in a stratified five-fold cross-validated grid search. The hyper-parameters
tuned for each algorithm can be found in Table 3. Probability estimates are enabled so that the models' false
positive rate are adjustable for different settings. All other parameters were set to the default.

Windows 10 pc with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-7500U CPU @ 2.70GHz and 8GB RAM.
Evaluation. The models were tested on the independent test set. AUC-PR (area under curve of precision
versus recall) and AUC-ROC (area under curve of sensitivity versus false positive rate) were used to evaluate
the overall performance of the probabilistic prediction model. The models' specificity, sensitivity, and balanced
accuracy (ACC) were evaluated at a decision threshold of 0.5. The equations for these evaluation metrics can be
found in (1) - (5) .

In addition, to investigate the effect of the imputation, we compared the models' performance on the entire
independent test set with that on the complete cases in the independent test set.
Finally, the models' performance on the independent cross-cultural/ethnic test set is evaluated using the
same evaluation metrics to investigate if the models, which are trained on white data, generalise well to non-
white population.
Explainability. Logistic regression models are inherently transparent and explainable. Random forest,
SVM, AdaBoost and XGBoost models are more algorithmic complex making it more diffcult for clinicians to
understand how predictions are made. For such models, we applied Kernel SHAP37, a model-agnostic game the-
oretic post-hoc interpretation method, to improve model explainability. SHAP is a unified approach of feature
importance with desirable properties, and it provides both explanations for the structure of the model (global
explainability) and for a specific prediction (local explainability). SHAP was applied to improve explainability
for a machine learning-based CDSS in neurology38. In our research, global feature importance is calculated by
the averaged absolute SHAP values of the entire independent test set for each feature to help users gain insight
of the overall behavior of the model. Furthermore, we used SHAP values of a particular instance to explain how
each feature and its value contribute to the predicted GDM risk for this participant.
Results
The majority of the participants included were white (90.70%) and predominantly white Irish (74.59%). All
participants had at least some secondary education and most women (83.88%) had at least some third degree
education. At baseline, maternal age was 32.57±4.40 years, height 1.64±0.07 m, body weight 79.15±10.78 kg
and BMI 29.23±3.30 kg/m2. At approximately 28 weeks gestation, 71 (14.67%) were diagnosed with GDM and
413 (85.33%) were not.
Feature and algorithm selection. To select the best machine learning algorithm for our models, we
compared the balanced accuracy of different algorithms with optimal feature sizes and hyper-parameters evalu-
ated in cross-validation. As shown in Fig. 4, SVM achieved the highest balanced accuracy for Model 1, 2 and
3 (0.761, 0.626, 0.624 respectively), and was thus selected over the other algorithms. For Model 1, five features
are included in the optimal feature set of this model: family history of diabetes mellitus (DM), weight, white cell
count, fasting glucose and insulin. For Model 2, five features are included in the model. They are: gestational age,
maternal age, family history of DM, weight and white cell count. For Model 3, four features are included in the
final feature set: gestational age, maternal age, family history of DM, and weight.
Model evaluation. Table 4 shows the performance of models evaluated on the independent test set as well
as the complete cases in the independent test set. Model 1 performs the best, achieving the AUC-PR of 0.485 and

Model performance on the entire independent test set and complete-case independent test set.
Model 1 : feature-agnostic model. Features: family history of diabetes mellitus, weight, white cell count, fasting
glucose, insulin. Model 2: clinical routine model. Features: gestational age, maternal age, family history of
diabetes mellitus, weight, white cell count. Model 3: remotely usable model. Features: gestational age, maternal
age, family history of diabetes mellitus, weight.
AUC-ROC of 0.792 on the independent test set. At the decision threshold of 0.5, the model predicts 73.3% of the
white GDM participants and 76.8% of the white non-GDM participants correctly, giving a balanced accuracy of
75.1%. The performance of the model on the complete cases is slightly higher than on the independent test set.
The model achieved the AUC-PR of 0.551, AUC-ROC of 0.860, and a balanced accuracy of 79.4% at decision
threshold of 0.5.
Model 2 gives a lower but acceptable performance, with an AUC-PR of 0.208 and AUC-ROC of 0.659 on the
independent test set. At the decision threshold of 0.5, Model 2 predicts 60% of the white GDM participants and
60% of the white non-GDM participants correctly, which gives a balanced accuracy of 60%. On the complete
cases, the model achieved similar performance, giving an AUC-PR of 0.256, an AUC-ROC of 0.690, and a bal-
anced accuracy of 59.2% at decision threshold of 0.5.
Model 3 performs similarly to Model 2. Model 3 achieved an AUC-PR of 0.199 and an AUC-ROC of 0.656
on the independent test set. At decision threshold of 0.5, 53.3% of the white GDM participants and 67.4% of the
white non-GDM participants are predicted correctly, which gives a balanced accuracy of 60.4%. On the complete
cases, the model achieved an AUC-PR of 0.320, an AUC-ROC of 0.687 and a balanced accuracy of 60.4%, which
are similar to that on the independent test set.
Model 1 outperforms Model 2 and 3, which can be explained by the exclusion of fasting blood biomakers in
Model 2 and 3. This indicates that fasting blood biomarkers, especially fasting glucose and insulin, are strong
predictors of GDM. Our models perform similarly on the entire independent test set and the complete cases in
the independent test set, showing that the imputation has little effect on model evaluation.
Comparison between white and non-white populations. Table 5 shows the performance of models
evaluated on the independent cross-cultural/ethnic test set compared with the independent test set. On the
independent cross-cultural/ethnic test set, Model 1 achieved good overall performance, comparable to the per-
formance on the independent test set. The model achieved the AUC-PR of 0.572 and AUC-ROC of 0.717. How-
ever, the model gives higher specificity than sensitivity at the decision threshold of 0.5. It predicts 60% of the
non-white GDM participants and 80% of the non-white non-GDM participants correctly, giving a balanced
accuracy of 70%.
Model 2 achieved an AUC-PR of 0.263 and an AUC-ROC of 0.643 on the independent cross-cultural/ethnic
test set, comparable to that on the independent test set. However, at the decision threshold of 0.5, 68.6% of non-
white non-GDM participants and only 30% of non-white GDM participants are correctly predicted.

Model 3 achieved similar overall performance on the non-white and white population, giving an AUC-PR of
0.293 and an AUC-ROC of 0.677. However, at the decision threshold of 0.5, the model is able to correctly predict
82.9% of non-white non-GDM participants and only 30% of non-white GDM participants.
From the comparison of the model performance on the independent test set and the independent cross-
cultural/ethnic test set, we found that our models, especially Model 2 and 3, achieved high specificity but low
sensitivity at the decision threshold of 0.5 on the independent cross-cultural/ethnic test set, although similar
overall performance (AUC-PR and AUC-ROC) was observed. In order to achieve an unbiased performance, a
lower decision threshold for non-white population is required. As a result, we conclude that our GDM prediction
models require a lower decision threshold to generalise to a non-white population.
Implementation and worked example. Our models have been implemented as a web server, which
serves as a CDSS prototype. The prototype allows users to submit the values for features required and it predicts
the probability that the person will develop GDM. It also provides explanations in order for users to understand
and trust the predictions. The prototype is freely available for academic use at http://lisda.ucd.ie/GDM-risk-
calculator.
To test the prototype, we selected two test cases, which are similar but have different outcomes, from the
independent test set (see Table 6). The two cases have similar values in most of the maternal characteristics except
for weight: Case 1, the GDM participant, has extremely high weight, while Case 2, the non-GDM participant,
has below average weight. Regarding blood biomarkers, Case 1 and 2 have similar white cell count, but Case 1
has higher fasting glucose and insulin than Case 2.
Suppose a user wants to test our CDSS prototype on these cases. They can simply enter the feature values for
each case into the corresponding input boxes on the web page and press the "calculate" button to get the results.
The CDSS will present the predicted risk for the case as well as the explanations.
Both cases were predicted correctly by Model 1, 2 and 3. The predicted GDM risks for Case 1 and 2 are 0.68
and 0.34 by Model 1, 0.68 and 0.44 by Model 2, and 0.54 and 0.42 by Model 3.
Our models are SVM-based models, and they are explained by Kernel SHAP in a post-hoc manner. Figure 5
shows the features ranked by their the global feature importance based on mean absolute SHAP values in all
models. Fasting glucose plays the most important role in Model 1, achieving mean absolute SHAP values much
higher than all other features. White cell count and weight are then of importance, followed by family history
of DM and insulin. In Model 2, weight is the most important feature, followed by maternal age and white cell
count. Gestational age and family history of DM play a less important role in Model 2. In Model 3, maternal age
is the most important predictor, followed by weight, gestational age and family history of DM.
Figure 6 shows the the local feature contribution based on SHAP values for Case 1 and 2 as well as the pre-
dicted GDM risk. A blue band indicates that the feature is dragging the prediction down to class non-GDM,
while a pink band shows that the feature leads to an increase in the predicted GDM risk. The length of the band
indicates the magnitude of the effect. It can be seen that the feature contributing the most to the opposite outcome
of Case 1 and 2 in Model 1 is fasting glucose. The fasting glucose of 4.8 mmol/L largely increases the predicted
GDM risk for Case 1, but the fasting glucose of 4.5 mmol/L decreases the risk for Case 2 greatly. This makes sense
because Case 1 has fasting glucose close to the average in GDM participants but Case 2 has fasting glucose equal
to the average in non-GDM participants (see Table 2). In Model 2 and 3, the features that contribute the most
to the opposite outcome of Case 1 and 2 is weight. A weight of 99.2 kg largely increases the predicted GDM risk

for Case 1, but a weight of 75.5 kg decreases the risk for Case 2. This makes sense because Case 1 has extremely
high weight but the weight of Case 2 is lower than average.
In conclusion, the case study provides illustrative examples of the applicability of our CDSS prototype, and
it shows that SHAP is able to reliably explain the individual predictions made by our models.
Discussion
This is the first machine learning study that specifically targets pregnant women with overweight and obesity for
GDM prediction. As opposed to previously published models (see Table 7) that predict GDM among all preg-
nant women, we focused on an at-risk group rather than prediction of GDM in a general pregnant population.
Targeting a high-risk group is more helpful for clinicians as GDM is more diffcult to identify in this cohort and
it would allow GDM screening in an effcient manner in a clinical setting. Also, this can be particularly helpful
in clinical practice if combined with a mobile health-supported lifestyle intervention that has been proven cost-
effective in pregnant women with an elevated BM139
Our dataset is highly unbalanced as the non-GDM participants outnumber GDM participants greatly. This
is also the case in previous works due to the prevalence of GDM. Unless properly handled, it can lead to a
model that only performs well on the majority (non-GDM) class, i.e. achieves high specificity but low sensitivity
17,24
(see ). We applied SMOTE to oversample the minority class in the training data. All of our models achieved
similar specificity and sensitivity, showing that the class imbalance problem is adequately addressed. In addition,
we used balanced accuracy instead of accuracy when testing, because the former gives a better evaluation of the
model performance in a class imbalance setting. On the contrary, accuracy is likely to overestimate the overall
performance of a model when it only performs well on the majority class.
An advantage of the study is that we carefully took the clinical usability into account in the modeling process.
Three models were developed: Model 1 which included all features available including fasting blood biomarkers
to assess GDM risk in a theoretical way; Model 2 which excluded fasting blood biomarkers for GDM prediction
in a clinical routine; and Model 3 including self-reportable features only for remote use. In contrast to our work,
most models in the literature included data from clinical tests that are not routinely performed in an Irish clinical
setting (see Table 7), including fasting blood test as well as other tests that are not available in our dataset, such
as coagulation function test and gene testing. The inclusion of these data may lead to an increase in the model
performance, but at the cost of usability because it makes the models diffcult to translate into clinical use. Our
Model 1 performs well achieving AUC-ROC of O. 792. This is slightly lower than some published models which
included fasting blood tests, because we included fewer blood tests and have focused on a high risk group of
women with overweight and obesity among whom GDM prediction is more diffcult compared to a general
pregnant population. Our Model 2 and 3, although they gave lower performance than Model 1, have greater
potential in a clinical setting as the features they use are easier to access clinically. Compared with previous
works, our Model 2 included only one feature from routine blood tests, whereas published models included
at least two blood test-related features. Our Model 3 is the first model that does not include any blood test. To
the best of our knowledge, there is no other published model that is directly comparable to ours. Our models
provide a novel benchmark for future researchers in GDM prediction. We recognise that the performance of
our models may require further improvement for use in a clinical setting, for example, by using some intelligent

To further improve clinical usability, we used feature selection to keep the amount of data entry on the CDSS
to a minimum, so that our CDSS would not be time-consuming for clinicians who have heavy workload to fit
into their workflow. Our models included a very small set of features (4 or 5) compared with published models
(4-2355), which means our models would be easier and faster to use. Moreover, our feature selection process was
conducted in collaboration with clinical experts. In our dataset, education level is higher in GDM participants
than non-GDM participants, and we trained models on such data which also reflected that a higher education
increased the risk of GDM. In literature, conflict evidence was reported on the association of education and
GDM. In order to avoid confusion and for our models to translate into clinical practice, education was removed
in consultant with clinical experts.
This is also the first machine learning study to investigate the potential ethnic/cultural difference in GDM pre-
diction. In previous works, all or the majority of the participants are from one ethnic group. Artzi et al.20 utilized
the electronic health records data in Israel. Hou et al.23 trained a model based on data from an unknown popula-
tion. All others used data collected in a single centre in different cities in China (Sichuan17'21, Shanghaii8'19'24'25
Beijing ) and the participants are all or mainly Chinese. For this reason, these researchers did not consider the

impact of culture/ethnicity on GDM prediction, and their models may not be applicable to other populations.
Our data was collected in a single centre in Dublin, Ireland. The majority of the participants are white (90.70%),
but black, Chinese, other Asian and mixed-ethnic women are also included. For the purpose of a novel inves-
tigation of the cross-cultural/ethnic difference in GDM prediction in women with overweight and obesity, we
trained models on a white population and tested them on non-white women. Our results show that AUC-PR
and AUC-ROC are similar between both groups, however, the decision threshold of 0.5 leads to lower sensitiv-
ity and higher specificity in non-white women than white women. It shows that a lower decision threshold is
required for a non-white population as opposed to a white population in GDM prediction. This is consistent
45
with medical literature, which specifies that GDM is more prevalent in non-white women than white women
We considered the explainability important in a CDSS. Despite an open debate in literature on whether or not
XAI is necessary or worth the substantial cost, the use of XAI has been reported to make CDSSs more acceptable
and trustworthy to users, and it may translate into a greater use of CDSSs11. In our research, SHAP was applied
to explain overall behavior of our models as well as the specific prediction made for an instance. Our case study
showed that SHAP generated reasonable explanations for our models. In addition, the effect of features on GDM
risk shown in the case study is consistent with medical knowledge. We found out that a high baseline fasting
glucose increased the risk of GDM. This is inline with medical literature which suggests median fasting glucose
is higher in GDM participants than others". We also showed that a high maternal weight increased the risk of
GDM, consistent with the increased risk of GDM with overweight and obesity indicated in literature. Therefore,
we anticipate that the explanations would help clinical users to gain insights into the model behavior and increase
the acceptability and trustworthiness of our CDSS, and thus enhance the potential for use in a clinical setting.
It also fills in the gap of the overall lack of XAI use in CDSSs.
To protect data privacy mandated by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in EU and the Health
Research Regulations (HRR) in Ireland, we avoided the use of instance-based learning algorithms, such as
k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN). KNN models are lazy learners and they involve saving the original training set
for computation when new data come in. They are suboptimal for a CDSS because they may lead to personal
data breaches.
Our work has been implemented into a web server that is currently available for academic use. It resolves
the problem of the lack of an open-access model or system for academic benchmarking. Further research is
required before adoption into clinical practice. Also, further cross-cultural/ethnic testing, preferably on a much
larger sample size, is needed to investigate the optimal decision threshold for different minority cultural or
ethnic groups. In addition, future work will be conducted to validate our prototype CDSS in a clinical setting.
Conclusion
We developed an explainable machine learning-based CDSS for the prediction of GDM in women with over-
weight and obesity to identify high-risk women for targeted intervention early in pregnancy. The CDSS includes
multiple models for theoretical, routine antenatal and remote settings to enhance clinical usability. It also provides

explanations for both the structure of the models and each specific prediction to gain trust from clinicians. A
web-based prototype of the CDSS is implemented and publicly available for academic use. We also investigated
the cross-cultural/ethnic difference in GDM prediction, which implies that a non-white population requires a
lower decision threshold than a white population. Further research is required to validate the CDSS in a clinical
setting.

Abstract
Introduction: High risk pregnancy refers to pregnancy with an increased risk of adverse outcome in mother or the baby. Scoring
the risk, will identify mothers at risk earlier, so that proper resource allocation, planned management or timely referral to higher
centers is facilitated and thereby perinatal mortality or morbidity can be reduced.
Methods: 200 pregnant women with term gestation, admitted to labour room were evaluated. The risk factors in each case were
assessed and their individual risk scores were determined using a simple scoring system. Subsequently their perinatal outcomes
were compared to their respective risk scores.
Results: It was found that there was a significant association between poor perinatal outcome and high risk pregnancies predicted
by this scoring schedule. 20% of the cases belonged to high risk group, out of which 32.5% cases had maternal complications.
Significant association between high risk score and perinatal mortality and birth asphyxia was found.
Conclusions: There was a significant correlation between high risk and poor perinatal outcome. So a simple scoring system, such
as the one used in our study, can be adopted at primary and rural health centers as a screening tool to predict pregnancies at high
risk for poor perinatal outcome. Thereby facilitating early referral of these women to tertiary care centres.
Keywords: High risk pregnancy, Risk score, Perinatal mortality, Birth asphyxia, Low birth weight.
Introduction
A relatively small percentage of high risk obstetric
population gives rise to a disproportionately high
percentage of perinatal and maternal morbidity and
mortality. Scoring the risk factors will be of immense
help to detect high risk pregnancies earlier and to
optimize their management.(l) In our study we use a
simple and easily applicable risk scoring system for
detection of high risk pregnancy and to find the
correlation between the various degrees of risk and
perinatal outcome. Such a scoring schedule will
facilitate early detection, proper resource allocation,
planned management and timely referral of high risk
antenatal women and thereby reduces perinatal
morbidity and mortality.
Methods
Study Design: Prospective analytical study
Study Period: January 2016 - June 2016
Study Setting: Department of Obstetrics and
Gynaecology, Kamineni Institute of Medical Sciences,
Narketpally.
200 Pregnant women with term gestation reporting
to the labour room at our institute during the study
period between January 2016 to june 2016 were
recruited regardless of their booked/ unbooked status,
age, parity, socioeconomic status, associated diseases
or complications etc. Careful history was elicited,
followed by thorough general, systemic, obstetric
examination and relevant investigations to determine
the risk factors in each case.
The observations were recorded in prenatal scoring
form based on scoring system suggested by Dutta and
Das(2) and individual risk scores were calculated (Table
1). Based on their total scores, the cases were divided
into low (0-3), moderate(3-5) and high risk(>/=6)
groups.
Subsequently the outcome for the mother in terms
of (1) Mode of delivery and (2) Complications like
postpartum haemorrhage, perineal tears, wound
infections, sepsis and mortality were studied.
The perinatal outcome variables studied, for the
babies were (1) Birth weight (low birth weight defined
as < 2500 gms, including both pre-term and SGA), (2)
APGAR score at one and five minutes (3) Birth
asphyxia, diagnosed by Apgar < /=3 at one and five
minutes after birth and acidemia (umbilical artery Ph
<7) and (4) Perinatal mortality (intrauterine deaths, still
births and early neonatal deaths upto seven days of
life).
These observations were compared with the
respective risk scores of the mothers. For statistical
evaluation, Chi square test for the analysis of
significance was used.
Results
The antenatal women who have been recruited in
the study were classified as low risk (0 — 2), moderate
risk (3
5) and high risk (>/= 6) based on the
cumulative total of their respective scores. Out of the
total 200 cases studied, 48% were graded as low risk,
33% as moderate risk and 20% belonged to high
risk(Tab1e 2).
20% of the low risk women and 41.35% of the
moderate risk group women were unbooked. The
prevalence of unbooked cases among high risk women
was as high as 77%. The need for operative intervention
increased with increasing risk score of the mother. It

Qualitative systematic review
1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective: The systematic review explores personal experiences and perceptions of (and on) resident Indian
women on family planning.
Methods: We included qualitative studies conducted among women, husbands and mothers-in-law. Search on five
databases (published between 2000 and May 8, 2019) and forward and backward citations search of included
studies were undertaken (April 2020). Three-stage screening and data extraction were done independently.
Iterative process was followed to thematically analyse the data and presented it using the World Health Orga-
nization conceptual framework on social determinants of health.
Result: Of 857 citations, we included 48 qualitative studies. Women's intent of using family planning services/
methods was influenced by multiple factors such as socio-demographic characteristics. Women's agency and
social status affected their standing in family planning decision-making. Fear of side-effects of contraception
methods, access to information and support, and cultural and religious beliefs hindered the use of modern
methods of contraceptive. Undesirable attitudes of service providers influenced underutilisation of family
planning services. Ineffective contraceptive choice counselling, particularly for poor section of the community
and high-risk groups were reported. While considering inter-pregnancy interval, some of the women opted for
induced abortion to terminate unplanned pregnancy however, had meagre acceptance for using modern con-
traceptive methods.
Conclusioru The findings call for reinvigorated efforts to provide effective and individually, religiously, regionally
and culturally appropriate interventions to improve family planning access and ultimately support better health
and rights of women in India.
India, a densely and second highest populated country in the world,
is in a phase of demographic and epidemiological transition. To control
its rising population, India felt an urgency of Family Planning (FP)
program in 1952 and became one of the first countries to launch the
"National Programme for Family Planning" (NPFP). Since its launch,
the NPFP has undergone various policy and implementation modifica-
tions and currently operating as part of Reproductive, Maternal,
Newborn and Child Health and Adolescents Program (RMNCAH+). In
the initial period of NPFP, the emphasis was on natural methods (e.g.,
rhythm method); subsequently the focus shifted on modern methods of
contraception such as condoms, diaphragms, and intra-uterine devices

(IUDs). Between 1962 and 1977, India adopted target-based, mass
sterilisation, monetary incentives and other coercive methods (e.g.,
male sterilisation). 3 In 1977, voluntary efforts of population control,
extending the services to maternal and child health (MCH) and incor-
porating indirect methods of population control were executed. Conse-
quently, the focus shifted on addressing the unmet needs of
contraception. Furthermore, India is now devoted to global initiatives
that focus on the Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) and rights
and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) e.g., goal no. 5 ("gender
equality and empowerment of women/girl") and target no. 3.7
(ensuring universal access to SRH services). Likewise, in 2012, India
obliged to achieving FP2020 (now FP2030) goals of improving access,
7
choice, and quality of FP services.

Over the years, India has made progress in FP-related indicators (e.
3
g., reduction in fertility rate from 4.97% in 1980 to 2.44% in 2015).
Despite this achievement, India is still distant in achieving some of the
targets laid down by the SDG (i.e., satisfying the 75% of the total de-
mand by use of modern FP methods). The unmet FP needs among In-
dian women especially belonging to lower socio-economic strata are
high. About 54% married and 44% all women (15—49 years) use any
type of contraceptive, and 48% married and 38% all women (15—49
years) use modern contraceptive methods. Among these women, within
10
one year of use, the discontinuation rate of contraceptives was high,
which are related to multiple factors. Compared to male sterilisation
and temporary modern contraceptives, female sterilisation (accounting
to 37% of women between 15 and 49 years of age), is the most preferred
approaches of limiting the family size. The number of female steri-
lisations carried out per annum is also higher as compared to other
countries. In 2015, the unintended pregnancy rate in India was 70.1 per
1000 women (15—49 years) and one-third of all the pregnancies ended in
induced abortions. Furthermore, the health facility survey conducted in
six Indian states reported that there were 15-6 million abortions with a
11 12
rate of 47 abortions per 1000 women in reproductive age group.
By addressing FP needs, more than 90% of low- and middle-income
country's child deaths and morbidity associated with abortion and
5611 13-15
pregnancy could be avoided.
Considering this, the govern-
ment of India is committed to enhancing the demand for modern
reversible contraceptives use to 54.3% among married women (15—49
9 10
years). ,
To highlight commonalities (or dissimilarities), it is important to
collate and summarise the opinion and perspectives of people belonging
to a wider group or context on a complex phenomenon. To the best of
our knowledge, there are no qualitative systematic reviews conducted
on the resident Indian population that studied perceptions of FP. Pre-
vious qualitative systematic reviews conducted elsewhere were focused
6 16-19
on a subset of population such as age group, provider or country.
Therefore, the present qualitative systematic review was designed to
explore personal experiences and perceptions of and on women about FP
in India. This review will fill the gap by accounting for the experiences,
expectations, emotions, needs, opinions, and feelings of resident Indian
women on the FP, which will further help guide policies and frame FP
interventions in India.
2. Material and methods
The protocol for this systematic review was registered with "PROS-
PERO: International prospective register of systematic reviews"
(CRD42018093960). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Re-
view and Meta-analysis has been adhered.
2.1. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are reported in
Table 1
2.2. Searching studies
Electronic databases viz. Medline (PubMed and Web of Science),
CINAHL, Scopus, and ProQuest were searched with a tailored search
strategy for each database until May 8, 2019. Multiple factors influence
FP and as time passes the perceptions may change hence, we decided to
consider studies that were published in the year 2000 or after (this re-
striction was not imposed at the time of protocol). Additionally, refer-
ence lists and forward citations (on April 12, 2020) of all included
studies were searched manually to find any relevant publications. The
search strategy (Additional file) combined keywords such as 'Family
Planning', 'Contraception', 'Experiences', 'Perception', 'Focus Group
Discussion' , 'In-depth interviews' , 'Ethnography'.

The studies focused on qualitative data including, but not
limited to, phenomenology, ethnography, action research and
grounded theory were eligible to be included. We considered
qualitative data collection methods such as in-depth
interviews, focus group discussions, observations and
qualitative case studies. Additionally, descriptive qualitative
studies that studied the experience or perceptions were
included. In case of mixed methods studies, only results of
qualitative analysis were considered.
Studies that probed the experiences and/or opinions on family
planning and related issues (such as barriers or facilitators of
contraception use) were included. For the purpose of this
systematic review, family planning was operationalised (in
accordance with the World Health Organization) as a
conscious effort of couple to limit childbirths or have
appropriate inter-pregnancy interval using temporary or
permanent contraceptive methods. Additionally, we
considered studies that discussed treatment of involuntary
infertility
Women (irrespective of age and fertility status) in
reproductive age groups living in India were included.
Additionally, perception of husbands, mothers and mothers-
in-law; if provided in the study were captured to address
pluralism. Men or mothers-in-law's opinion supplemented the
information in generating the similarities or dissimilarities in
women's opinion. Nevertheless, we excluded the study if it
was exclusively focused on men or healthcare providers. In the
case of a mixed population, we extracted perceptions of the
population of our interest. Additionally, we considered studies
undertaken on people living with HIV, drug users, and women
undergoing abortion, if it was focused on phenomena of our
interest or had described at least one theme/subtheme of
family planning. Studies conducted in other countries among
Indian women such as American Indian were excluded.
Journal publications, theses, dissertations, reports, books or
book chapters were included. We included studies irrespective
of publication type or peer reviewed status. However, reviews,
secondary analyses, editorials, commentaries, letters, and
conference proceedings were excluded.
We included studies published in English.
2.3. Selection of studies
EndNote x 7 was used to manage the data and Microsoft Excel
spreadsheet for screening. Two authors (PH, SSP) screened citations by
their titles and abstracts, independently. Full-text screening was un-
dertaken independently by PH, SSP, and VSD in two groups. Any dis-
agreements between the authors on a decision to include the articles
were resolved by discussions until consensus within and between
groups.
2.4. Data extraction
A data extraction sheet was prepared, and extraction was carried out
by PH, SSP, and VSD, independently, in pairs. Disagreements, if any, on
extracted data were resolved by discussions, within and between the
pairs. The extracted data included study identifiers, data collection
methodology, study location, contextual details of participants, and
qualitative data of phenomena (themes and quotes).
2.5. Data analysis
We undertook manual thematic analysis to analyse the qualitative
6 16 20 21
data. ,
SSP read the extracted data multiple times and generated
the coding frame. Quotations reported in included studies were read and
deciphered to get a deeper understanding of the data. Each study was
examined for consistencies, dissimilarities and contradictions in the
perceptions or experiences to generate a new, wider understanding of
the phenomena, without altering the originality of the primary data.

S.S. Parsekar et al.
The coding scheme enabled the systematic identification of analytic
patterns and theoretically important concepts. SSP and PH further dis-
cussed these codes, refined them (by rereading the study, if needed) and
grouped the codes after reaching consensus. Subsequently, repeated
occurring codes were synthesised and classified into overarching
themes, which led to the development of thematic framework. Within
each theme we described the content and meaning of the data extracted
from included studies. To confirm trustworthiness, the emerging themes
were re-examined by all the authors. Subsequently, we prepared the
final list of themes through discussion and consensus. A theme appear-
ing in more than one paper does not justify the intensity of data validity.
Therefore, study references within a specific theme are reported. To
summarise and explain the linkages between the themes and subthemes
we utilised the "World Health Organization (WHO) conceptual frame-

4. Discussion
To our best knowledge, this qualitative systematic review is the first
one conducted to collate the evidence to inform on perceptions and
experiences of women about FP in India. Findings highlights that the
multiple determinants influenced women 's intent of using FP services or
methods. These determinants can be linked to improving the unmet FP
needs and SRH and rights, in conformity with the SDGs 3 and 5.
Although review participants were in favour of getting married after
18 years, some women were married, parous or pregnant before
attaining the legal age of marriage (18 and 21 years for women and men
23
in India, respectively). As per a national survey conducted in India,
there were a significant proportion of adolescent (15—19 years) women
who were married (15.2%) and pregnant or parous (8%) in the year

This is a major concern especially for India considering

the effect of adolescent pregnancy and childbirth on MCH. Early mar-
riages are often associated with higher fertility rate, early childbearing
practices, shorter birth intervals, and decreased knowledge and access to
25
FP methods.
Marriage brings numerous responsibilities to women, and women
are expected to perform in an "ideal" way as defined by societal pressure
and in-laws' expectations. It is a cultural notion, especially in India, that
marriage is not only a union of two people, but also a union of two
families. Additionally, marriage embarks on the societal and familial
expectation of initiating a childbearing and childrearing. But, soon after
marriage women are at the forefront to take the entire responsibility to
prove their womanhood and receive respect from the family and society
by being fertile and childbearing; if not, there was a threat for experi-
encing discrimination and divorce.
Most of our participants were not or minimally educated and had low
socio-economic status. The majority of the participants were favouring
small family size and were well versed with its benefits including
reduced financial burden, MCH and other responsibilities associated
with child-rearing. The finding is congruent with existing evidence of
26
importance of investing in FP. Nonetheless, almost one-fourth of the
studies reported that having a son was one of the prime factors for
influencing FP decision-making. Reasons for son preference were

gender selective abortions. This evidence is congruent with other liter-
ature, that suggests India and China together contributes to nine out of

manifestation of deep-rooted gender bias irrespective of socio-economic
status of people in India.

Structural factors determine stratification and
division of social class within the society, and it
defines person 's socio-economic standing within
ladder of power, prestige and access to
resources. It includes context, structural
mechanisms and the resultant socioeconomic
position, these together influence intermediary
determinants. Various contextual factors
emerged from the data; these are described
further. Detailed synthesis can be found in
Additional file.
Social policies: As per government order, Baiga
community in Chhattisgarh denied access to
family planning (FP) services as a result, women
had multiple pregnancies, which deteriorated
health. Because of this, women visited nearby
states to avail FP services, or they hide/gave up
their cultural identity.
Some of the cultural and societal values related
to FP (timing, number & gender of child) were
mythic and women/couple follow these norms
willingly. However, some participants presumed
that they do not have choice but to oblige
societal and family pressure. Some norms are
specific to indigenous, Muslim or Hindu family
Sub themes under this are described further.
Women perceived the ideal age for marriage to be
18 years. After marriage, society expected woman
to be 'ideal' wife and mother, and women
perceived that it was their duty to fulfil these
expectations. Women expressed that they were
expected to be sexually available for husbands.
Husband 's dominance in sexuality and women 's
submissiveness were commonly reported. Threats
from husband about re-marriage were reported.
Although, polygamy among tribal was not
common, it increases the fertility prospects.
Also, tribal population accepted the pre-marital
sex and relationships, as well as childbearing.
However, discussion on sex was a taboo and need
for sex education was discussed.
Women perceived that it was the social obligation
to have their first child soon after marriage There
were different reported reasons for the same, viz.
Familial and societal pressure, community
judgement, and proving womanhood If a woman
has a child soon after marriage her social status
(respect from society and family) improves.
Some women also shared threat of abandonment
if they don't have a child after marriage
Participants also shared consequences of
infertility.
Family planning (FP) and culture: FP is culturally
not acceptable in some culture. Participants were
influenced by faith healers who discouraged FP.
Participants avoid talking about family planning
because of shame or embarrassment. Sterilisation
was not acceptable and barren woman's
prospect of going for levirate marriage decreased.
Some other tribal practices were also discussed,
which prevented women going for FP.
Family planning and religion: It was found that
'people 's volition in contraceptive use or sterilisation
was a sin'. Participants voiced that tribes were
banned from worshiping after sterilisation and
Islam forbids contraception or sterilisation. They
often felt that it was God's wish in deciding the
number and timing of children. Some also
expressed that if a woman was sterilised, she was
considered 'impure for the last rites'.
Most participants expressed timing of childbearing
to be soon after marriage because it gives them
feeling of incompleteness. Some felt it should be

delayed and others expressed it should be
depending on the age of the women.
Sex composition and preference: Only a subset of
women did not prefer a particular gender of the
child, while others expressed to have one girl and
a boy Those who expressed girl preference felt
that girls are useful for instrumental help and they
get bride-price. Girl aversion was common
considering the dowry practice in India. Son
preference was predominantly seen and was
determined by number of children, economic
and social benefits, family name, and old-age
support.
Concept of family size and spacing varied between
studies. Small family norm was expressed
considering the economic benefits, future
prospects, maternal and child health. However,
others felt having multiple children were useful,
while some others left it on God's wish. HIV
status of parents was also important predictor of
deciding the family size
Women's agency (in terms of choice- having
ability to opt for FP, voice- capacity to assert
one's interest and power in constraining or
enabling voice and choice) is influenced by
multiple factors. In contrast to younger
(adolescent or youth) and not/ less educated
women, older women are more likely to have a
steady stand and decision of timing and number
of children. Older women were more inclined to
use permanent sterilisation methods.
Furthermore, abuse (from the husband), threats
of divorce/separation and remarriage made
women submissive to the men's decision on FP.
Male dominance, influence of mother-in-law and
women's submissive behaviour were commonly
reported by the included studies that were
hindering the socio-economic position of
women. However, it was women 's responsibility
to use the contraceptive methods, and there was
resistance from men to use condom or male
sterilisation.
Women who had strong premarital agency
(agency here is a general concept and not
restricted to FP) or who were older in age tended
to have better decision-making power and they
were found to delay their marriage and
childbearing for career or education. Other
socio-demographic factors were employment,
education, age of women (described in section
1 3) and husband's employment status. Some
expressed joint decision making, however,
majority expressed it as male dominance. Mother-
in-law's involvement in FP decision making is
strongly rooted in Indian culture. Participants
reported female centric nature of contraception
and lack of involvement of husbands in FP
counselling or discussions
Women were aware of contraceptive methods but
were not aware of their proper use, and were
found to be mostly using sterilisation, rhythm
method and injectable. Others were not aware of
reversible contraceptives other than abstinence. FP
information was often sought from friends of the
same gender, Accredited Social Health Activist or
were influenced by healthcare providers and
media. Women had limited access to FP
information and expressed further need for
information. Lack of awareness on FP was also
found among husbands. Women's education
influenced use of FP. Education and occupation
are interlinked and are related to economic
standing of the women. Educated women may
have better access to information, which in turn
help in making an informed decision-making on
FP.

Themes
Subthemes/Categories
Women expressed desire to use contraception,
but often left with no choice. As a result, they
were left with anxiety of pregnancy or tried
different tactics to avoid pregnancy such as going
to their natal house or subversive avoidance of
sexual intercourse, coming to bed late and secretly
using FP methods.
In line with the conceptual framework, we
identified multiple intermediary determinants of
health. Fear of side-effects of reversible
contraceptives was one of the major
psychological barriers of using FP methods.
Health status of women or of first born, HIV
status of women or husband, and history of drug
addiction influenced decision on use of FP.
Furthermore, access, availability of healthcare
facilities and attitude of healthcare professionals
were documented. Two conditions on which
people were deciding to take a call on the FP
methods or choices were, family size achieved
and inter-pregnancy interval. When desired
family size was achieved, participants either
opted for sterilisation or induced abortion.
Whereas, to achieve a desired inter-pregnancy
interval family opted for contraceptives or
induced abortion. This finding also suggests that
participants opted for induced abortion to
terminate unplanned pregnancy to limit the
number of children or spacing between the
pregnancies.
Fertility intention among HIV positive or drug
users were expressed. The desired were based on
existing child(dren) or son preference, pressure
from society, wanted some reason to live, and
positive reinforcement after antiretroviral therapy.
Inconsistent condom use was reported among
HIV positive individuals. Desire to have a child
also depended on health of the couple, fear of HIV
transmission to child and future prospects.
Women usually resorted to abortion as a means
to end unintended pregnancy to limit family size,
or wanted to have spacing between childbirths
Some even opted for multiple induced abortions.
Reasons were first child's health or women 's
health, resistance to use contraception, domestic
violence, economic reasons, sex selective abortion,
first child male, conceived in the month of 'Adi' in
Tamil Nadu, pregnant with man having same gotra
(Clan), influence of astrology, and were shameful
because of existing adolescent child. However,
others considered abortion as sin. Abortion
among unmarried was also reported. The easy
accessibility of healthcare services was reported to
go for abortion. Women desired confidentiality
while resorting to abort the child. Some women
also reported unprofessional methods of
abortion.
As a result of not conceiving soon after marriage
women sought advice and treatment from faith
healers and unqualified healthcare providers.
Women believed in fate, spirits, witchcraft or the
'evil eye' that determined their ability to
conceive. Faced embarrassment at the idea of
seeking treatment for infertility. Information
access, cost, availability, accessibility, waiting
time, navigating healthcare facilities and
unavailability of trained staff were some of the
factors to avail the healthcare services. It also
dependent on familiarity of healthcare staff.
Participants were discouraged by false
commitments or threats, indifferent attitude of
healthcare providers.

size completion and was considered as necessary
and inevitable, one time, no fear of pregnancy
once the family size is complete. Women
expressed fear of side-effects, and
misconceptions, cumbersome to use irreversible
modern contraceptives. Male sterilisation was not
a favoured option as it was considered to cause
loss of vitality or impotency. Some considered
contraceptives or sterilisation use against their
religion. There was lack of information on use,
disposal, access and cost of condoms.
Participants felt condoms hinders sexual
pleasure, and associated it with extra-marital
sex Some participants trusted traditional or
natural methods of birth control such as coitus
interruptus, rhythm method, abstinence, and sex
during menstruation. These methods were
encouraged by faith healers and were simple,
healthy, and economical, and had no side-
effects.
Our review participants comprehended inter-pregnancy spacing in-
tervals, however intention of using contraceptives was not corre-
sponded. One of the major decision-making factors for FP use was
husband's support, but regrettably most of the women received meagre
support from husbands and mothers-in-law. Majority of the women
complied with the husband's decision, but some women took the risk of
going against the family's decision and secretly resorted to using con-
traceptives and as a result lived with a fear of getting caught. Women
remain at socially disadvantaged positions due to gender inequality and
lack of decision-making power (related to number and timing of child-
24
birth). FP not only addresses the unmet contraceptive needs, but also
helps in overcoming gender equity and equality, and growth of the in-
11
dividual, society and country.
There were misconceptions about using FP methods (in general)
across the country, disapproval regarding religious and socio-cultural
norms and paradox related to men's attitude. Similar findings were re-
19
ported by reviews conducted among 40+ and younger than 25 years
aged women. Furthermore, we found that female sterilisation was the
most utilised method of contraception once the desired family size was
reached. Aforesaid finding was consistent with Indian data, wherein
female sterilisation accounted for three out of four modern contracep-
11
tive uses. Women's preference to use sterilisation could be due to fear
of using reversible methods of contraception and partly because of In-
dia's history of FP programs. Indian FP program, through its inception,
mostly focused on limiting the family size by encouraging women to
adopt permanent sterilisation methods. Additionally, history of coercive
male sterilisation during 70s might have created a lasting fear among the
people. Although the program received multiple modifications, it is
deeply rooted in people's mind, which may be the reason for favouring
female sterilisation. Furthermore, high female sterilisation might be
related to associated reasons of not favouring temporary modern con-
traceptives as described below.
Our review demonstrated the difficulties in complying with oral
contraceptive pill (OCP) regimen. Participants associated the use of
condoms with extra marital sex, commercial sex and sexual transmitted
diseases, which hindered its use. Women had lack of agency or control
over condom use as it was considered a male contraceptive. Almost all
the studies reported fear of side-effects of contraception (due to prior
experience or heard from others), especially IUDs and OCPs, therefore
they were inclined to use traditional methods of contraception. Similar
6 25
findings were reported by other reviews. ,
In 2015, there were about
13% Indian women who had unmet contraceptive needs and 6% women
12
practiced traditional methods of contraception.
Some of our review participants opted for induced abortion for un-

6


S.S. Parsekar et al.
abortion could be due to multiple factors such as accessibility to its
6 11 25
resistance to modern contraception methods (as discussed
use, ,
above) or lack of awareness related to FP. Our findings are compatible
11 12
with quantitative studies conducted in India , and further provide the
perceptions of women for its inclination. As discussed in the back-
ground, induced abortion is associated with adverse health condition (as
well as social stigma due to which many women hide abortion history).
Our review highlights the FP service use among drug addicts and
PLHIV. The possible reason behind this could be effective contraceptive
choice counselling among high-risk populations for preventing sexually
transmitted infections. However, the findings based on the general
population reported that condom use was considered as a barrier to
sexual pleasure. This underscores the urgent need of a health literacy
program by developing both the skills and mind-set about its proper
27
use. One of the included studies in our review reported the atrocities
faced by indigenous people in Chhattisgarh due to FP policy change
(government order 1979). Nevertheless, it is important to note that
Chhattisgarh High Court quashed this order in 2018 as the order was
28
violating human rights.
In general, our review participants had credibility issues on gov-
ernment health facilities due to various reasons, such as the attitude of
the healthcare professionals, which is coherent with the conflict theory
29
of decision-making. Similar to our findings, accessibility, economic
reasons, social stigma and prejudices of healthcare providers were the
main reason for not accessing FP services. However, not utilising pro-
fessional healthcare services eventually intensifies the risk of medical
11 16
complications.
Gender of the attending doctor was found to be
another factor influencing utilisation of healthcare service in another
19
review, but we did not come across any such finding in our review.
4.1. Strengths and weakness
As our systematic review considered wider ethnic, cultural and
geographic regions, it increases the scope of taking a broader view of the
findings. Additionally, we have considered perceptions of men and
mothers-in-law to get an extensive representation. Quantitative studies
often cannot find the underlying reasons for a particular outcome;
nevertheless, our review reduces the gap reported by Cleland25 by
comprehensively identifying the reasons for almost all the FP related
concepts in India. Furthermore, these reasons are explained using the
22
WHO framework for social determinates of health.
Despite commonalities in overarching themes, we cannot apply the
findings to population belonging to a higher socio-economic stratum
because of paucity of data in this group of people. Almost 68.8% of In-
11
dia's population reside in villages therefore, findings can be general-
ised to a larger population of the country. We paid more importance to
the experiences and perceptions of people compared to the methodo-
logical issues of the included studies. Additionally, we could not cate-
gorise the studies based on study quality as measured using Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme checklist (Additional file) therefore, we did
not use it while generating the findings of the review. Most of the
included studies did not report qualitative methodologies appropriately
(e.g., type of qualitative data, details on analysis, positionality and
reflexivity of researchers); therefore, we suggest future researchers to
follow standard reporting guidelines and report a methodology that is
reproducible. Furthermore, due to resource constraint, we restricted the
studies to English language.
4.2. Implications for policy and research
The ongoing programme (RMNCAH+) focusing on SRH and rights in
India to be continued and may consider our findings in revising
approach for meeting the needs of target population. The implications of
the current review findings are listed below-
Clinical Epidemiology and Global Health 12 (2021) 100906
Information, education and counselling/behaviour change commu-
a.
nication: Our review perpetuates that many perceptions and prac-
tices associated with FP adoption were based on misconceptions and
traditional socio-cultural beliefs. Developing contextual behaviour
change strategies to address the misconceptions and traditional
11
socio-cultural beliefs without hurting the cultural and religious
sentiments could be good approach to increase the awareness of
modern contraceptives and alleviate the psychological fears associ-
ated with them. An age-appropriate culturally acceptable sex edu-
cation along with improvement in access to FP services could help in
avoiding unintended and early pregnancy, especially among
24
adolescent and young women. A previous conducted review rec-
ommended that counselling is an effective means of increasing the
uptake of contraceptive use, especially when combined with ante-
5
natal or postnatal care.
b.
Edutainment approach: Delivering the key messages related to FP
using audio-visuals and a story can be a strong media especially for
influencing illiterate population.
Focusing on sexual and reproductive health and rights: Interventions
c.
directed on enhancing the uptake of FP methods can be improvised
by giving importance to the demand-side uptake along with a choice-
based approach with focus on SRH and rights.
d.
Life planning skills: Context-specific mandatory module on life
planning skills consisting of SRH and rights should be included in the
school curriculum.
Community engagement: There is a need for FP program designed
e.
through the engagement of various influential stakeholders such as
faith healers, informal healthcare providers, high-risk populations
and other influential stakeholders. We highlight the importance of
30
woman's agency in FP and to involve community to enhance
women empowerment by effective awareness creation and shared
responsibility among all the stakeholders.
f.
Youth responsibility programmes: Youth in India can be the biggest
assets in promoting, propagating, creating awareness and influ-
encing (with the help of modern technology/mediums such as social
media) the peers and society in using appropriate FP methods. Cre-
ation of youth responsibility programmes is the need of the hour.
Healthcare strengthening: There is need to increase the accessibility,
g.
availability and affordability of modern contraceptive use especially
considering the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, which has disrupted
the entire healthcare system in the country.
h.
Human resource and capacity building: India has a vast network of
accredited social health activists (also known as ASHA), whose ca-
pacity can be improvised to deliver some of the contraceptives e.g.,
condoms and OCPs to the needy population. ASHA's can also be
trained to create awareness about FP. Training and capacity building
of healthcare providers, frontline health workers and ASHAs should
12
be carried out periodically. The government can consider using
alternative systems of medicine practitioners, especially in rural re-
gions to deliver FP services.
1. Innovative strategies and research: Our findings suggest that condi-
tional cash transfer (monetary incentives for availing sterilisation)
from the government health facility was not a motivating factor for
the uptake of sterilisation as the money provided was minimal and
was spent on medicines. Therefore, we suggest more research on to
identify culturally and economically viable methods to increase the
access to safe and voluntary FP as a basic human right. Research
development should be a priority for meeting the people's needs
especially assessing the effectiveness of contraceptives that have low
risk of side-effects and are cost-effective.
Addressing other social issues: Eliminating gender bias (SDG 5)
j.
cannot be addressed in isolation but, can be endeavoured through
designing a comprehensive integrated program. The program could
focus on addressing dowry, women unemployment and empower-
ment, education on SRH and rights among the girls and women and

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Equitable access to contraception is critical for reproductive autonomy. Using cross-sectional data from the
DocStyIes survey administered September—October 2020 (68% response rate), we compared changes in family
planning-related clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during the COVID-19 pandemic
and assessed service provision issues among 1063 U.S. physicians whose practice provided family planning
services just before the pandemic. About one-fifth of those whose practices provided the following services or
strategies just before the pandemic discontinued these services during the pandemic: long-acting reversible
contraception (LARC) placement (16%); LARC removal (17%); providing or prescribing emergency contraceptive
pills (ECPs) in advance (18%); and reminding patients about contraception injections or LARC removal or
replacement (20%). Many practices not providing the following services or strategies just before the pandemic
initiated these services during the pandemic: telehealth for contraception initiation (43%); telehealth for
contraception continuation (48%); and renewing contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit
(36%). While a smaller proportion of physicians reported service provision issues in the month before survey
completion than at any point during the pandemic, about one-third still reported fewer adult females seeking
care (37%) and technical challenges with telehealth (32%). Discontinuation of key family planning services
during the COVID-19 pandemic may limit contraception access and impede reproductive autonomy. Imple-
menting healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the need for in-person visits (e.g., telehealth for
contraception, providing or prescribing ECPs in advance) may decrease disruptions in care. Resources exist for
public health and clinical efforts to ensure contraception access during the pandemic.
Ensuring equitable patient access to family planning services,
including but not limited to contraception, is critical for promoting
reproductive autonomy (
as these
Holt et al., 2020; Potter et al., 2019
services support individuals and their partners to choose if and when to
become pregnant. Family planning services are also important to pre-
vent unintended pregnancies, which represent nearly half of all U.S.
pregnancies (Finer and Zolna, 2016). Unintended pregnancies are
associated with adverse maternal and infant health outcomes (Gipson
et al., 2008; Qiu et al., 2020
), although it is difficult to disentangle the
multiple social and economic inequity factors that influence both
pregnancy intention and poor maternal and infant health outcomes
Zambrano et al., 2020). Access to contraception might be especially
important during public health emergencies, such as the coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, when fertility preferences might
change (
Lindberg et al., 2020). For example, individuals may want to
postpone pregnancy during the pandemic because pregnant persons
with COVID-19 are at significantly higher risk for severe outcomes
compared with non-pregnant persons with COVID-19, even though the

absolute risks for severe COVID-19-associated outcomes among preg-
nant and non-pregnant persons are low (Zambrano et al., 2020
). Addi-
tionally, a survey of U.S. women examining the intersection of
pandemic-related economic challenges and reproductive experiences
found that those whose finances had worsened during the pandemic
were more likely to want to delay childbearing or have fewer children
because of the pandemic (Lindberg et al., 2020)
The COVID-19 pandemic has affected healthcare access, delivery,
and utilization in the United States (Czeisler et al., 2020; Demeke et al.,
). Healthcare systems
2020; Koonin et al., 2020; Mehrotra et al., 2020
and clinics have closed or reduced services to optimize resources and
mitigate infection risks for patients and providers. Best practices and
resources have been compiled to help providers continue to deliver
family planning services during the pandemic (Reproductive Health
National Training Center (RHNTC), 2020; University of California San
). Healthcare delivery stra-
Francisco (UCSF) School of Medicine, 2020
tegies include telehealth visits; curbside pickup or mail delivery of
supplies; providing a 12-month supply of contraception to reduce the
need for follow-up visits; preemptively giving prescriptions for or sup-
plies of emergency contraception pills (ECPs); and proactively reviewing
patient charts to identify those who will soon run out of supplies or are
due for a contraceptive injection or long-acting reversible contraception
(LARC, intrauterine device or implant) management (Reproductive
Health National Training Center (RHNTC), 2020
). Although many of
these strategies reduce the need for in-person visits, clinic visits remain
necessary for LARC insertion and removal, if desired by patients, and
these services may be particularly impacted by the pandemic.
Nevertheless, evidence suggests the COVID-19 pandemic has dis-
rupted access to family planning services. One survey found that one in
three U.S. women reported that contraceptive or other reproductive
health visits were delayed or cancelled or that they experienced chal-
lenges accessing contraception (Lindberg et al., 2020). Less is known
about providers' perspectives regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic
has affected family planning service delivery. One survey of office-based
obstetrician-gynecologists found that most have continued to provide
reproductive health services during the pandemic, but that they have
faced challenges (e.g., declines in patient volume, financial and staffing
challenges) and changes (e.g., telehealth utilization) within their prac-
Weigel et al., 2020
). We sought to expand what is known about the
tices (
effect of the pandemic on family planning service provision from the
perspectives of a broad range of U.S. physicians. Using data from a web-
based panel survey of primary care physicians, pediatricians, and
obstetrician-gynecologists working in outpatient and inpatient settings,
our objectives were to compare changes in family planning-related
clinical services and healthcare delivery strategies before and during
the pandemic and assess specific service provision issues experienced
during the pandemic.
2. Methods
We analyzed cross-sectional data from the Fall 2020 DocStyIes sur-
vey, a web-based panel survey of U.S. healthcare providers commis-
sioned by Porter Novelli Public Services (http://styles.porternovelli.co
m) and administered September 14—0ctober 26, 2020 by SERMO
http://www.sermo.com). The survey, which contained 135 questions,
assessed healthcare provider attitudes and practices on a broad range of
health topics, including family planning service provision, just before
and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
2.1. Study sample
Respondents were sampled from SERMO's Global Medical Panel of
medical professionals. Quotas were predetermined to reach 1000 pri-
mary care physicians, 250 obstetrician-gynecologists, 250 pediatricians,
and 250 nurse practitioners or physician assistants. Invitations to
participate were sent via email. Participation was voluntary.
Preventive Medicine 150 (2021) 106664
Respondents were paid an honorarium of $54—$72 for completing the
survey depending on the number of questions they were asked. The
family planning service provision questions were fielded with primary
care physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists, and pediatricians. The
overall response rate was 68%; by physician specialty, response rates
were 69% for primary care physicians, 69% for obstetrician-
gynecologists and 76% for pediatricians.
2.2. Measures
Nine questions were added to the Fall 2020 DocStyIes survey to
examine family planning service delivery during the pandemic. Physi-
cians were asked how many female patients of reproductive age (15—49
years) for whom their practice provided family planning services per
week just before the COVID-19 pandemic. Those providing family
planning services were asked about practice-level clinical services pro-
vided and strategies used (assessed separately), at two different time
points - just before and at any point during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Clinical practices assessed included: LARC placement; LARC removal;
telehealth for contraception initiation; and telehealth for contraception
continuation. Clinical strategies assessed included: accepted self-report
of blood pressure during telehealth visits for contraception; renewed
contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit; allowed
curbside pickup or mail delivery of contraception; supported self-
administration of subcutaneous injectable contraception; counseled on
extending use of LARC beyond their FDA-approved duration; provided
or prescribed ECPs in advance; provided or prescribed a year's worth of
oral contraceptives; and sent patient reminders about DMPA [depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate] injections or LARC removal or replace-
ment. Additionally, physicians were asked about specific practice-level
issues experienced related to providing family planning or sexually
transmitted infection (STI) services because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
at two different time points - at any point during the pandemic and in the
month before survey completion. Issues assessed included: fewer adult
females seeking care; clinic closed for in-person appointments; LARC
placement services limited; LARC removal services limited; decreases in
contraceptive supplies; technical challenges with telehealth; confiden-
tiality concerns with telehealth; billing challenges with telehealth; and
patient discomfort with telehealth. The survey also collected informa-
tion on provider and clinical practice characteristics.
2.3. Statistical analysis
Of 1503 physicians who completed the survey, we excluded 440
whose practice did not provide family planning services to female pa-
tients of reproductive age just before the pandemic, resulting in an an-
alytic sample of 1063 physicians.
We described physician and clinical practice characteristics of re-
spondents. We also described practice-level family planning-related
clinical services provided and strategies used, just before and at any
point during the COVID-19 pandemic; and practice-level service provi-
Sion issues experienced because of the COVID-19 pandemic, at any point
during the pandemic and in the month before survey completion. We
used the McNemar's test of dependent proportions (Fagerland et al.,
) to compare estimates by time period (i.e., just before and at any
2014
point during the COVID-19 pandemic, for clinical services provided and
strategies used; and at any point during the COVID-19 pandemic and in
the month before survey completion, for service provision issues expe-
rienced). We considered findings with a p-value <0.05 as statistically
significant. Additionally, among physicians who reported their practice
provided the clinical service or used the strategy just before the
pandemic, we examined the proportion who reported their practice
discontinued the service or strategy during the pandemic (i.e., did not
provide at any point during the pandemic). Similarly, among physicians
who reported their practice did not provide the clinical service or did not
use the strategy just before the pandemic, we examined the proportion
2


L.B. Zapata et al.
who reported their practice initiated the service or strategy during the
pandemic. Outcomes are presented overall and by physician type to
inform clinic-based improvements.
Analyses of DocStyIes survey data do not require Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention Institutional Review Board evaluation since the
data licensed from Porter Novelli do not include personal identifiers; the
activity is considered non-human subjects research. We analyzed the
data using SAS software, version 9.4.
3. Results
Most respondents were primary care physicians (34.0% were family
practitioners and 28.7% were internists) while 22.7% were obstetrician-
gynecologists and 14.7% were pediatricians (
). Most had prac-
Table 1
ticed medicine for 210 years (76.3%), were aged 245 years (59.3%),
were male (61.6%), and self-identified as non-Hispanic White (61.5%).
Respondents represented all U.S. regions. Most worked in a suburban
area (52.7%) and primarily in a group outpatient practice (74.6%).
Family planning patient volume just before the COVID-19 pandemic (i.
e., average number of female patients of reproductive age who received
family planning services per week) was low (1—10 patients) for most
respondents (58.6%) while 29.9% reported moderate (11—50 patients)
and 11.5% reported high (251 patients) volume.
3.1. Changes in clinical services provided and strategies used
The proportion of physicians whose practices provided LARC ser-
vices significantly decreased when comparing the period just before the
pandemic with any point during the pandemic (LARC placement: 41.2%

increases in the proportion of physicians reporting the following
practice-level services or strategies were observed when comparing the
period just before the pandemic with any point during the pandemic:
telehealth for contraception initiation (27.6% vs 55.8%); telehealth for
contraception continuation (29.4% vs 60.1%); accepted self-report of
blood pressure during telehealth visits for contraception (among those
who provided telehealth for contraception initiation or continuation)
(44.8% vs 57.8%); renewed contraception prescriptions without
requiring an office visit (54.9% vs 62.2%); and allowed curbside pickup
or mail delivery of contraception (18.5% vs 29.5%). Significant changes
were not observed for the following strategies: supported self-
administration of subcutaneous injectable contraception (15.6% vs
15.5%); counseled on extending use of LARC beyond their FDA-
approved duration (26.3% vs 25.8%); provided or prescribed ECPs in
advance (33.8% vs 35.4%); provided or prescribed a year' s worth of oral
contraceptives (52.0% vs 52.3%); and sent patient reminders about
DMPA injections or LARC removal or replacement (22.8% vs 22.1%).
Whereas decreases in LARC placement and increases in renewed
contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit were
observed overall, no changes in these practices were observed for pe-
diatricians comparing the period just before the pandemic with any
point during the pandemic (data not shown; 16.7% vs 15.4% for LARC
placement, 55.8% vs 59.6% for renewed contraception prescriptions
without requiring an office visit). Also, although not significant overall,

more pediatricians provided or prescribed ECPs in advance of need at
any point during the pandemic (34.6%) compared with the period just
before the pandemic (27.6%).
3.2. Clinical services and strategies discontinued
Among physicians whose practices provided the following services
or strategies just before the pandemic, > 15% reported their practice
discontinued these during the pandemic: LARC placement (16.0%);
LARC removal (16.7%); accepted self-report of blood pressure during
telehealth visits for contraception, (among those who provided tele-
health for contraception initiation or continuation both just before and
at any point during the pandemic) (26.5%); renewed contraception
prescription without requiring an office visit (16.3%); allowed curbside
pickup or mail delivery of contraception (22.3%); supported self-
administration of subcutaneous injectable contraception (30.7%);
counseled on extending use of LARC beyond their FDA-approved dura-
tion (29.6%); provided or prescribed ECPs in advance (18.4%); and sent
patient reminders about DMPA injections or LARC removal or replace-
ment (20.3%) (Table 3).
Discontinuation of LARC placement and LARC removal services
significantly differed by physician type (data not shown), being highest
among pediatricians (23.1 % and 33.3%, respectively) and lowest among
obstetrician-gynecologists (9.4% and 10.4%, respectively). Discontinu-
ation of providing or prescribing ECPs in advance of need also differed
by physician type (data not shown), being highest among primary care
physicians (24.8%) and lowest among pediatricians (9.3%).
3.3. Clinical services and strategies initiated
Among physicians whose practices did not provide or use the
following services or strategies just before the pandemic, 215% reported
their practice initiated these during the pandemic: telehealth for
contraception initiation (43.0%); telehealth for contraception continu-
ation (48.4%); accepted self-report of blood pressure during telehealth
visits for contraception (among those who provided telehealth for
contraception initiation or continuation both just before and at any
point during the pandemic) (42.6%); renewed contraception pre-
scriptions without requiring an office visit (35.9%); and allowed curb-
side pickup or mail delivery of contraception (18.6%) (
Table 3)
Initiation of telehealth for contraception differed by physician type
(data not shown); initiating telehealth for contraception initiation and
continuation was highest among obstetrician/gynecologists (65.1 % and
71.3%, respectively) and lowest among primary care physicians (34.8%
and 40.7%, respectively). Initiating providing or prescribing a year's
worth of oral contraceptives also varied by physician type (data not
shown); whereas only 3.0% of pediatricians initiated this practice, it was
initiated by 15.6% of primary care physicians and 31.4% of obstetrician-
gynecologists.
3.4. Service provision issues experienced
Substantial proportions of physicians reported experiencing specific
practice-level service provision issues during the pandemic, but signif-
icantly fewer reported these issues in the month before survey comple-
tion: fewer adult females seeking care (49.0% vs 36.6%); clinic closed
for in-person appointments (31.4% vs 14.4%); and among physicians
whose practices provided these services before the pandemic, limited
LARC placement services (36.3% vs 17.6%) and limited LARC removal
services pandemic (31.9% vs 16.5%) (Table 4). Similarly, physicians
reported experiencing practice-level challenges with telehealth services
during the pandemic, but significantly fewer reported these challenges
in the month before survey completion: technical challenges (45.8% vs
31.7%); confidentiality concerns (21.8% vs 17.0%); billing challenges
(32.7% vs 23.1%); and patient discomfort (31.2% vs 21.9%). Despite
reductions in practice-level issues experienced when comparing at any

4. Discussion
We found many changes in family planning clinical services when
comparing service delivery before and during the pandemic and some
Preventive Medicine 150 (2021) 106664
differences by physician type. We observed slight decreases in the pro-
portion of physicians overall whose practices provided LARC services,
reflecting physicians whose practices offered LARC services before but
discontinued these services during the pandemic. Approximately one in
five physicians surveyed whose practices provided other key routine
contraception practices just before the pandemic, reported practice-
level discontinuation of these practices during the pandemic (e.g.,
providing or prescribing ECPs in advance and sending patient reminders
about DMPA injections or LARC removal or replacement). We observed
increases in the proportion of physicians whose practices used service
delivery approaches that improve access and reduce the need for in-
person visits (i.e., telehealth for contraception, accepted self-report of
blood pressure during telehealth visits for contraception, renewed
contraception prescriptions without requiring an office visit, and curb-
side pickup or mail delivery of contraception), reflecting physicians
whose practices did not offer these services before but initiated these
services during the pandemic. The physicians surveyed also experienced
practice-level service provision issues during the pandemic (e.g., fewer
adult females seeking care, clinic closed for in-person appointments).
While a smaller proportion of physicians reported these issues in the
month before survey completion compared with at any point during the
pandemic, about one-third still reported fewer adult females seeking
care.
We observed low availability of LARC services both before and
during the pandemic. A core component of quality family planning
services is patient access to a broad range of contraceptive methods,
including LARC (Gavin et al., 2014). As part of providing patient-
centered care and supporting individual reproductive autonomy, ac-
cess to in-person visits for LARC placement and removal services is
needed, if LARC services are desired by patients. Access to LARC
methods, which are highly effective (Trussell et al., 2018) and have few
medical contraindications for use (Curtis et al., 2016a
might be
particularly important during the pandemic given possible changes in
attitudes toward contraception. One study found that one in four women
overall, and one in two women with concerns about reduced access to
contraception, reported thinking more about getting a LARC method
because of the pandemic (Lindberg et al., 2020)
Only one in three physicians surveyed reported their practices pro-
vided or prescribed ECPs in advance (both before and during the
pandemic), despite evidence-based guidance supporting advance pro-
vision of ECPs so they can be taken as soon as possible after unprotected
sexual intercourse (Curtis et al., 2016b). This finding may be because
levonorgestrel ECPs are available over-the-counter in the United States
and physicians may not perceive that they have an important role
ensuring patient access to emergency contraception. However, despite
over-the-counter access, barriers to ECPs remain, including stocking
issues and confusion about access requirements (
Upadhya, 2019)
Emergency contraception is an important backup contraceptive option
and might have increased salience during the COVID-19 pandemic
because of potential pandemic-related contraception access barriers.
A promising finding from our analysis is use of telehealth for
contraception care, in line with recommendations to offer telehealth
services during the pandemic (Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
). Our analysis found that more than half of physicians
tion (CDC), 2020
surveyed reported providing telehealth for both contraception initiation
and continuation at some point during the pandemic, reflecting signif-
icant increases compared with just before the pandemic. These findings
are similar to prior surveys of family planning providers that found
increased provision of telehealth services for contraception during the
COVID-19 pandemic (Stifani et al., 2020; Weigel et al., 2020
). Never-
theless, recent medical claims data have shown that while telehealth
services have grown rapidly during the pandemic, these services were
not sufficient to offset drops in in-person visits (Cox and Amin, 2020)
Moreover, providers have reported challenges with telehealth including
technical difficulties, inability to conduct physical exams and diagnostic
testing, and lack of guidance on telehealth best practices (Stifani et al.,
5


L.B. Zapata et al.
2020; Weigel et al., 2020
). In our survey, although physicians reported
fewer practice-level telehealth issues in the month before survey
completion compared with at any point during the pandemic, suggesting
gained experience implementing telehealth over time, nearly one in
three continued to report technical challenges with telehealth, and
approximately one in five continued to report confidentiality concerns,
billing challenges, and patient discomfort with telehealth. Confidenti-
ality concerns with telehealth remained a particular issue for pediatri-
cians. Resources are available to support family planning service
delivery through telehealth, including information on providing person-
centered care, workflow best practices, billing, and online pharmacies
Converge Partners in Action. Provision of Person-Centered Reproduc-
tive Health Care via Telemedicine, 2020; University of California San
Francisco (UCSF) school of Medicine, 2020)
Few physicians surveyed reported their practices initiated or
implemented several suggested practices to help family planning pro-
viders meet patient needs during the COVID-19 pandemic (Reproductive
Health National Training Center (RHNTC), 2020
) (i.e., supporting self-
administration of subcutaneous injectable contraception, counseling
on extending use of LARC beyond their FDA-approved duration, and
sending patient reminders about DMPA injection or LARC removal or
replacement). Self-administration of subcutaneous injectable contra-
ception is safe, feasible, and improves method continuation rates (
Katz
et al., 2020; Kennedy et al., 2019; Lerma and Goldthwaite, 2019
); it also
reduces the need for in-person visits. Additionally, evidence suggests
that the risk of pregnancy while using a LARC method for 1—2 years
longer than prescribed is low (
Ali et al., 2017; McNicholas et al., 2017,
Thaxton and Lavelanet, 2019; Ti et al., 2020). For patients who desire
continued LARC use, consideration of extending use beyond FDA-
approved duration may provide ongoing pregnancy protection for pa-
tients having difficulty accessing LARC services (Reproductive Health
National Training Center (RHNTC), 2020
). Last, proactively reviewing
patient charts and sending patient reminders prompts patients to
schedule an appointment before a lapse in contraception protection.
Low use of these strategies highlights opportunities for service delivery
improvement to increase contraception access. Provider training may be
needed to increase provider awareness of and confidence implementing
certain strategies.
4.1. Limitations
Our findings are subject to several limitations. Respondents were
sampled from a volunteer panel of medical professionals, and sampling
was not random or population based. As such, findings are not gener-
alizable to the U.S. population of primary care physicians, pediatricians,
and obstetrician-gynecologists, and statistical inferences should be
interpreted with caution. No information was collected about non-
respondents, so we are unable to determine how respondents and non-
respondents differed with respect to family planning service provision.
Data are based on physician self-report of practice-level experiences and
some responses may be inaccurate due to recall, social desirability, or
other types of reporting error. We assessed clinical practices used at any
point during the COVID-19 pandemic rather than routine provision or
provision at different time points during the pandemic (e.g., early versus
later months); as such, findings may overestimate initiation and un-
derestimate discontinuation of practices during the pandemic. Also
related to discontinuation of practices, we do not know if discontinua-
tion occurred because of the physician (regardless of patient demand) or
because of a lack of patients seeking services. Assessment of service
provision issues experienced was related to providing family planning or
STI services, so we do not know with certainty that issues reported were
specific to family planning service delivery. We focused on contracep-
tion services in this analysis, but acknowledge that family planning
services include a wider range of services, such as pregnancy testing and
counseling, basic infertility services, and STI screening and treatment
(Gavin et al., 2014). Last, we only assessed experiences of physicians
Preventive Medicine 150 (2021) 106664
who reported providing family planning services to female patients of
reproductive age and recognize that physicians may also provide these
services to individuals not identifying as female.
5. Conclusions
Discontinuation of key family planning services during the COVID-
19 pandemic may limit contraception access, which may impede
reproductive autonomy and contribute to unintended pregnancies.
Implementing healthcare service delivery strategies that reduce the
need for in-person visits (e.g., telehealth for contraception initiation and
continuation, curbside pickup or mail delivery of contraception,
providing or prescribing ECPs in advance, providing or prescribing a
year's worth of contraception) may decrease disruptions in care. Re-
sources exist for public health and clinical efforts to ensure contracep-
tion access during the pandemic.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective: Pregnancy among systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-affected women is highly associated
with poor obstetric outcomes. Predicting the risk of foetal outcome is essential for maximizing the success
of pregnancy. This study aimed to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to predict pregnancy
outcomes among SLE-affected pregnant women.
Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 149 pregnant women with SLE, who were followed
at Shariati Hospital (104 pregnancies) and a specialized clinic (45 pregnancies) from 1982 to 2014. We
selected significant features (p <O.IO) using a binary logistic regression model performed in IBM SPSS
(version 20). Afterward, we trained several artificial neural networks (multi-layer perceptron [MLP] and
radial basis function [RBFI) to predict the pregnancy outcome. In order to evaluate and select the most
effective network, we used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.
We finally developed a CDSS based on the most accurate network. MATLAB 2013b software was applied
to design the neural networks and develop the CDSS.
Results: Initially, 45 potential variables were analysed by the binary logistic regression and 16 effective
features were selected as the inputs of neural networks (P-value < 0.1). The accuracy (90.9%), sensitivity
(80.0%), and specificity (94.1%) of the test data for the MLP network were achieved. These measures for
the RBF network were 71.4%, 53.3%, and 79.4%, respectively. Having applied a 10-fold cross-validation
method, the accuracy for the networks showed 75.16% accuracy for RBF and 90.6% accuracy for MLP.
Therefore, the MLP network was selected as the most accurate network for prediction of pregnancy
outcome.
Conclusion: The developed CDSS based on the MLP network can help physicians to predict pregnancy
outcomes in women with SLE.
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune
disease with a worldwide distribution. SLE, as an inflammatory
multi-system disease with unknown aetiology, has different clini-

cal manifestations and symptoms, laboratory signs, and prognosis

. According to studies, the prevalence of SLE varies
in patients
worldwide. A meta-analysis of 16 studies carried out in North
America and Europe indicated that the prevalence of SLE is 23.8 per
100,000 [31
. In Iran, SLE is relatively common with a prevalence of
40 per 100,000 [11. The overall prevalence of SLE in women is much
more than in men, and is mostly common in the reproductive age
Pregnancy in SLE-affected women is a major challenge. Young
women with SLE who want to become pregnant encounter a num-
ber of risks to their and their unborn baby's health
[5]
. Pregnancies
in SLE-affected women may lead to foetal loss in the form of a
spontaneous abortion (before 20 weeks of gestation) or intrauter-
ine foetal death (still birth after 20 weeks of gestation) [3]. Foetal


240

loss has decreased significantly from 43% in the 1960s to 17% in
the early 2000s in SLE-affected women
Although in recent
years foetal survival has increased due to better understanding
of the causes of abortion in SLE patients and better therapeutic
approaches
[4,71,
foetal loss continues to be higher among SLE-
affected women than the normal population. Overall, about 20%
of pregnancies in SLE-affected women end up in foetal loss
[61.
A study conducted in 2013 shows a pregnancy loss rate of 35.8%
in organ-threatening SLE-affected women compared with healthy
women where the pregnancy loss rate is 8.9% [8]. Generally, the
incidence of spontaneous abortion is approximately 14—35% among
SLE-affected women, while it is 7—12.5% in the normal population
Special gynaecological and rheumatological care is necessary to
increase the chance of pregnancy success. Regarding the impor-
tance of pregnancy outcomes, pregnancy in SLE patients should
be planned in advance, and the patients should be monitored
before and during the pregnancy 9 . However, decision-making
and prediction of pregnancy outcomes in SLE patients is a complex
task for physicians. A variety of factors with different degrees of
effectiveness may affect the outcome of pregnancy in SLE-affected
women. In addition, non-linear relationships between these fac-
tors and the outcome of pregnancy may result in more complexities
Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are considered to be
useful tools for solving sophisticated problems. A CDSS is designed
to help healthcare providers make timely decisions about their
patients [14 . These systems can be developed based on the experts'
knowledge, historical data analysis, or clinical evidence
[15,161.
In this regard, a variety of algorithms such as neural networks,
fuzzy logic, regression, Bayesian networks, or a combination of
these algorithms have been successfully applied in different fields
of clinical practices
[16-20].
Prediction of pregnancy outcomes for SLE patients can notice-
ably contribute towards providing effective health consulting
and therapeutic services, as well as prevent undesirable out-
comes and physical and psychological complications resulting
from an abortion
[21 ,22].
Considering the importance of influ-
ential factors on the outcome of pregnancy (risk factors), many
studies have been conducted worldwide to identify these fac-
tors. For example, factors such as high blood pressure, lupus
nephritis, thrombosis, anti-phospholipid antibodies, flare up of
lupus during six months before pregnancy, anti-cardiolipin anti-
bodies, lupus anti-coagulant, anaemia, leucopoenia, age at time
of conception, history of abortion, the number of children, and
many other factors have been introduced in previous studies
The numerous risk factors and the com-
plexity of relationships among these risk factors necessitate the
development of a CDSS. Application of CDSS in maternal care in
developing countries has been previously reported
[27] •
how-
ever, to the best of our knowledge, no CDSS has been developed
to support physicians in predicting the outcome of pregnancy in
SLE-affected women. Therefore, in this study, we developed and
evaluated a CDSS based on an artificial neural network (ANN) appli-
cation.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Data source and data collection
In order to identify the potential variables, we first conducted
a literature review and an interview with a rheumatologist. We
used this search strategy to find related literature: (systemic lupus
erythematosus OR SLE) AND (predictor* OR risk factor* ) AND (preg-
nancy outcome OR foetal loss) in PubMed, Scopus, and Google
Scholar. We selected related articles published in English from
2005. In addition, we considered local evidence and rheumatol-
ogist consultations. We identified 50 potential variables in this
regard; however, five of these 50 variables (anti Ro/ss-A and anti
La/ss-B antibodies, anti-b2-glycoprotein I antibody [anti-b2GPI],
serum albumin level, and antihypertensive use) were mostly not
recorded in the patients' records. Therefore, we collected data for
the other 45 variables. The needed data was retrospectively col-
lected from the medical records of SLE-affected pregnant women
who had visited a specialized hospital (Shariati Hospital) and a spe-
cialized clinic in Tehran, Iran from 1982 to 2014. We also used the
database of these cases in the Rheumatology Research Center to
collect some required data elements that were not available in the
medical records. A trained researcher (the first author) extracted
the data from the medical records and the database.
Out of 400 registered pregnancies, the medical records of only
149 of these pregnancies were available and eligible for analysis
(104 from the hospital and 45 from the specialized clinic). The final
dataset included the 45 possible influential factors and pregnancy
outcomes of the cases.
2.2. Pre-processing and feature selection
The outcome of pregnancy had four categories: first-trimester
spontaneous abortion, second-trimester spontaneous abortion,
and preterm and term live birth. We re-classified these categories
into two classes: spontaneous abortion and live birth.
There was data missing for some variables. One of the
approaches for resolving such a problem is using the mean or
mode of the variable for all samples belonging to the same class.
This approach has been applied in previous studies
[18,281.
There-
fore, we also replaced missing values by the mean of each class for
numeric values and the mode of each class for non-numeric values.
Multiplicity ofthe variables (features) may result in overtraining
a model. Therefore, one of the most commonly used pre-processing
techniques is dimension reduction or feature selection. In this
regard, irrelevant, weakly relevant or less important features are
removed
[28].
Feature selection may improve the accuracy of the
resulting model. Researchers have applied a variety of techniques
for this purpose
. For this end, we used the binary logistic
regression method through IBM SPSS software (version 20). Sixteen
important features (P-value <O.IO) were finally selected as inputs
to train the neural networks.
2.3. Designing neural networks
We selected ANNs as our training algorithms because these net-
works have been successfully applied to develop a CDSS for many
situations in healthcare [16]
, and ANNs usually perform better than
statistical methods
[31].
We used the selected features from the previous step as the
inputs of the ANN. Inputs were normalized before being entered in
networks by using the min/max method. We developed two differ-
ent models of ANN including a feedforward multilayer perceptron
(MLP) network with a scaled conjugate-gradient (trainscg) back-
propagation learning algorithm and a radial basis function (RBF)
network with a Levenberg-Marquardt (trainlm) back-propagation
learning algorithm using MATLAB 2013b software. The learning
algorithm for MLP and RBF neural networks can be mentioned using
the generalized delta rule and gradient descent because they have
nonlinear activation functions. Using a back-propagation algorithm
in the procedure of learning requires the change in weight made by
the gradient descent rule
[32-34].
During the procedure of learning
in neural networks, an epoch is accomplished when all the training
examples are presented to the network and are processed using the
learning algorithm only once
[35].

studies [36]. Therefore, in this work, several MLP and RBF networks
with different topologies were trained, and the performance of each
network was assessed based on the testing, validation, and train-
ing dataset application. For training the MLP network, the dataset
was randomly split into training (70%), validation (15%), and test-
ing (15%) data. For the RBF network, we randomly split the dataset
into training (70%) and testing (30%) data.
2.4. Evaluation of the networks and development of the CDSS
In order to evaluate and select the most accurate network, we
used a confusion matrix and calculated the percentage of sensi-
tivity, specificity, and accuracy of each network. In addition, the
performance of the networks was evaluated by the receiver oper-
ating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve
(AUC). Maximizing AUC indicates a satisfying classification
[20,371.
In addition, for the selected MLP and RBF networks, we used 10-fold
cross-validation, too. All calculations were based on the standard
equations published elsewhere
[38,391.
Finally, we developed the
CDSS based on the most accurate network. MATLAB 2013b software
was applied to design the CDSS.
3. Results
3.1. Identifying important variables for predicting pregnancy
outcomes among women with SLE
Initially, we identified 50 variables that appeared to affect the
pregnancy outcomes among SLE women. Among the pregnancies,
103 (69%) resulted in live births (including 23% preterm and 46%
full-term). In addition, there were 46 (31%) spontaneous abortions

Table 1
shows these variables and their definitions. After run-
ning the binary logistic regression, we selected the most significant
factors for predicting the pregnancy outcome. Twelve variables
with P-value<O.05 and four variables with P-value<O.10 were
selected (Table 1 ). Tables 2 and 3 indicate the distribution of these
features for the SLE-affected women in our dataset.
3.2. Designing and evaluating MLP and RBF neural networks
3.2.1. RBFstructure
The radial basis function (RBF) network architecture consisted of
basic functions (combination of simple functions) in a single hid-
den layer and linear functions in an output layer. We developed
several networks with a different number of neurons and func-
tions spread in the hidden layer. Table 4 indicates the performance
of some of the trained networks with the different number of neu-
rons. As seen, Network 3 was the most accurate. In this network,
there are 55 epochs. The spread of basic functions is 12 and the
goal is reaching the zero error. Outcomes are classified by two neu-

rons in the output layer. These neurons represent the occurrence of
spontaneous abortion and live birth in pregnant women with SLE.
As shown in Table 5,
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for
the selected RBF network (in the test data) were 71.4%, 53.3%, and
79.4%, respectively. In addition, Fig. 1 shows the ROC graph of this
network. The AUC of this RBF network was 0.84 for the total data.
The 10-fold cross-validation for this RBF showed 75.16% accuracy.
3.2.2. MLP structure
The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network architecture con-
sisted of sigmoid activation functions in the single hidden layer and
a log-sigmoid activation function in the output layer.
Table 6 indi-
cates the performance of some of the trained networks. As seen,
Network 3 was the most accurate. In this network, there are 24
epochs. The gradient is 0.09 and the goal reaches the zero error.
Outcomes: are classified by one neuron, which represents the
occurrence of spontaneous abortion and live birth in pregnant
women with SLE.
According to
Table 7
, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in the
test data were 90.9%, 80.0%, and 94.1%, respectively. In addition,
the ROC graph of the selected MLP network is shown in
. The

comes in SLE-affected women.
AUC of this network was 0.97 for the total data. The 10-fold cross-
validation for this MLP showed 90.6% accuracy.
3.2.3. Developing the CDSS
Comparing the performance of the trained networks indicated
that the MLP's Network 3 was the most accurate for developing the
CDSS. The graphical user interface of this CDSS is shown in
Fig. 3.
As seen in this figure, rheumatologists can easily input the values
of the 16 variables and get the result of prediction of the pregnancy
outcome.
4. Discussion
Predicting the outcome of pregnancy in women with SLE, and
providing proper and effective care for these patients can increase
the expectancy of foetal survival for families. However, predict-
ing this problem is still complicated because of the multiplicity
of affecting variables and the complexity of their relationships
with regard to this problem. We developed a CDSS for predict-
ing pregnancy outcomes among SLE-affected women. We applied
two neural networks for this prediction. According to the results,
accuracy of MLP and RBF networks for the test data was 90.9% and
71.4%, respectively. In addition, the MLP outperformed RBF net-
works using the total data.
Although, to the best of our knowledge, there are no other
studies related to developing models using neural networks or
other machine-learning algorithms for predicting the pregnancy
outcomes of SLE-affected women, researchers successfully applied
neural networks for either multivariate analysis or predicting a
range of diseases or for disease risk estimation
[31].
According to
the previous research, the performance of the classification algo-
rithms, especially neural networks, may be different from one

[66,671.
However, in most studies in which the
performance of different neural networks has been compared, the
MLP network performance was better than the others in the field
of prediction task of medicine, a result that is consistent with our
findings. For example, a study was conducted by Bovis et al. to iden-
tify masses in digital mammograms using both the MLP and the
RBF (based on Gaussian kernels) networks in the UK. This study
revealed that the MLP network with the best performance showed
an AUC value of 0.74 in contrast to the AUC value of RBF (0.73) [681.
In addition, Kurt et al. compared the performance of classification
methods: in order to predict the presence of coronary artery dis-
ease (CAD) and found that areas under the ROC curves were 0.783,
0.753, 0.745, 0.721, and 0.675 for MLP, logistic regression (LR), clas-
sification and regression tree (CART), and RBF, respectively
[371. The
better accuracy of the MLP networks has been confirmed for pre-
dicting and classifying other medical conditions, such as internal
carotid arteries (ICA) stenosis (87.5% vs. 80%) [69 , middle cerebral
artery (MCA) stenosis (94.2% vs. 88.4%) [70], and thyroid diseases
(88.3%—89.3% based on different learning algorithms vs. 81.7%)
[32].
However, there are studies indicating that RBF performance may
be somewhat better than the MLP in some areas, such as predict-
ing the risk of essential hypertension disease (85.5% vs. 86.3%) [66].
Therefore, researchers should avoid making a conclusion based on
only one method. The decision of a method selection should be
made based on a comparison between different methods applied
to a specific dataset.
As our results indicate, the MLP network with a scaled
conjugate-gradient (trainscg) back-propagation learning algorithm
with 90.9% accuracy had the best performance. The network con-
sisted of sigmoid functions and 18 neurons in the single hidden
layer, and a log-sigmoid function and one neuron in the output
layer. Therefore, we applied this model to develop a CDSS.
The risk of undesirable foetal outcomes estimation in the early
first trimester of pregnancy by rheumatologists may guarantee
a desirable pregnancy outcome. When an SLE-affected pregnant
woman is visited for the first time by a rheumatologist, the lat-
ter enters the values of 16 effective factors into the developed
), which then predicts the outcome of the pregnancy
CDSS (

in two classes (spontaneous abortion and live birth) by a click on
the button for pregnancy outcome in the designed system. In this
way, the rheumatologist can decide optimally about the patient
and her treatment. While the system predicts spontaneous abor-
tion for one case, that case should be considered as high risk
[9,711.
In this setting, the expert rheumatologist can start to manage the
pregnancy more skilfully to have a favourable outcome in these
high-risk pregnancies by regular monitoring and the recommen-
dation to take appropriate medications during pregnancy adjusted
to the patient's medical history and risk factors
[72]
. It is generally
accepted that systematic monitoring is needed for all SLE-affected
women to improve their pregnancy outcome
. Thus, more fre-
quent specific care and interventions are required for the mothers
for whom the system predicts spontaneous abortion rather than
those for whom the system predicts live birth; this may ensure
correct planning and management of care for these patients
[73].
In addition, many women with SLE discontinue their medications
when they find themselves pregnant
[10].
Thereby, awareness of
the risk for the mothers can help to manage the condition prop-
erly with regard to alterations in their medications and appropriate
counselling by some recommended continuation and discontinu-
ation of the medications
[47,721.
Therefore, rheumatologists can
decrease the effect of specific factors associated with incidence
of spontaneous abortion in SLE-affected women until delivery by
specifically maintaining and monitoring the mother. It can improve
the health of the mother and maximize the chances of a successful
delivery
Hence, this system may be effective to reduce
the risk of foetal loss.
Some limitations should be considered in this research. Most
cases of pregnant patients with SLE were excluded due to a large
quantity of missing data in their medical records or the related
databases. Therefore, the results may not be generalizable. In addi-
tion, we could not access data about five variables: anti Ro/ss-A
and anti La/ss-B antibodies, anti-b2-glycoprotein I antibody (anti-
b2GPI), serum albumin level, and antihypertensive use. Finally, we
removed these five variables. Therefore, conducting similar studies
with a larger dataset is recommended.
In this study, we replaced missing data. Although this approach
is a standard pre-processing technique, it might result in bias. We
re-built the selected MLP network without replacing any missing
data. According to the results, the accuracy of this new network
was 77.3%.
In addition, we first identified important features based on the
literature review and then selected the most important ones using
logistic regression. For comparison, we re-developed the network
without any feature selection. The results indicated that the accu-
racy, sensitivity, and specificity of this new network were 90.9%,
75.0%, and 94.4%, respectively. These results show that the network

Physiological changes in pregnancy

Abstract
Physiological changes occur in pregnancy to nurture the
developing foetus and prepare the mother for labour and
delivery. Some of these changes influence normal biochemical
values while others may mimic symptoms of medical disease.
It is important to differentiate between normal physiological
changes and disease pathology. This review highlights the
important changes that take place during normal pregnancy.

During pregnancy, the pregnant mother undergoes significant
anatomical and physiological changes in order to nurture and
accommodate the developing foetus. These changes begin after
conception and affect every organ system in the body.l For
most women experiencing an uncomplicated pregnancy, these
changes resolve after pregnancy with minimal residual effects.
It is important to understand the normal physiological changes
occurring in pregnancy as this will help differentiate from
adaptations that are abnormal.
Haematological changes
Plasma volume increases progressively throughout normal
pregnancy.2 Most of this 500/0 increase occurs by 34 weeks'

gestation and is proportional to the birthweight of the baby.
Because the expansion in plasma volume is greater than the
increase in red blood cell mass, there is a fall in haemoglobin
concentration, haematocrit and red blood cell count. Despite this
haemodilution, there is usually no change in mean corpuscular
volume (MCV) or mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration
(MCHC).
The platelet count tends to fall progressively during normal
pregnancy, although it usually remains within normal limits.
In a proportion of women (5—10%), the count will reach levels
of 100—150 x 109 cells/l by term and this occurs in the absence
of any pathological process. In practice, therefore, a woman is
not considered to be thrombocytopenic in pregnancy until the
platelet count is less than 100 x 109 cells/l.
Pregnancy causes a two- to three-fold increase in the
requirement for iron, not only for haemoglobin synthesis but
also for for the foetus and the production of certain enzymes.
There is a 10- to 20-fold increase in folate requirements and a
two-fold increase in the requirement for vitamin BE
Changes in the coagulation system during pregnancy
produce a physiological hypercoagulable state (in preparation
for haemostasis following delivery).3 The concentrations
of certain clotting factors, particularly VIII, IX and X, are
increased. Fibrinogen levels rise significantly by up to 500/0 and
fibrinolytic activity is decreased. Concentrations of endogenous
anticoagulants such as antithrombin and protein S decrease.
Thus pregnancy alters the balance within the coagulation system
in favour of clotting, predisposing the pregnant and postpartum
woman to venous thrombosis. This increased risk is present from
the first trimester and for at least 12 weeks following delivery. In
vitro tests of coagulation [activated partial thromboplastin time
(APT T), prothrombin time (PT) and thrombin time (TT)] remain
normal in the absence of anticoagulants or a coagulopathy.
Venous stasis in the lower limbs is associated with venodilation
and decreased flow, which is more marked on the left. This is due
to compression of the left iliac vein by the left iliac artery and
the ovarian artery. On the right, the iliac artery does not cross
the vein.
Cardiac changes
Changes in the cardiovascular system in pregnancy are profound
and begin early in pregnancy, such that by eight weeks' gestation,
the cardiac output has already increased by 20%. The primary
event is probably peripheral vasodilatation. This is mediated
by endothelium-dependent factors, including nitric oxide
synthesis, upregulated by oestradiol and possibly vasodilatory
prostaglandins (PG12). Peripheral vasodilation leads to a 25—30%
fall in systemic vascular resistance, and to compensate for this,
cardiac output increases by around 40% during pregnancy. This
is achieved predominantly via an increase in stroke volume, but
also to a lesser extent, an increase in heart rate. The maximum
cardiac output is found at about 20—28 weeks' gestation. There is
a minimal fall at term.


90
CARDIOVASCULAR JOURNAL OF AFRICA • Volume 27, No 2, March/April 2016
An increase in stroke volume is possible due to the early
increase in ventricular wall muscle mass and end-diastolic
volume (but not end-diastolic pressure) seen in pregnancy. The
heart is physiologically dilated and myocardial contractility
is increased. Although stroke volume declines towards term,
the increase in maternal heart rate (10—20 bpm) is maintained,
thus preserving the increased cardiac output. Blood pressure
decreases in the first and second trimesters but increases to
non-pregnant levels in the third trimester.
There is a profound effect of maternal position towards
term upon the haemodynamic profile of both the mother and
foetus. In the supine position, pressure of the gravid uterus on
the inferior vena cava (IVC) causes a reduction in venous return
to the heart and a consequent fall in stroke volume and cardiac
output. Turning from the lateral to the supine position may
result in a 25% reduction in cardiac output. Pregnant women
should therefore be nursed in the left or right lateral position
wherever possible. If the woman has to be kept on her back,
the pelvis should be rotated so that the uterus drops to the side
and off the IVC, and cardiac output and uteroplacental blood
flow are optimised. Reduced cardiac output is associated with
a reduction in uterine blood flow and therefore in placental
perfusion, which could compromise the foetus.
Although both blood volume and stroke volume increase
in pregnancy, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central
venous pressure do not increase significantly. Pulmonary vascular
resistance (PVR), like systemic vascular resistance (SVR),
decreases significantly in normal pregnancy. Although there is no
increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), serum
colloid osmotic pressure is reduced by 1()—15%. The colloid
osmotic pressure/pulmonary capillary wedge pressure gradient
is reduced by about 30%, making pregnant women particularly
susceptible to pulmonary oedema. Pulmonary oedema will be
precipitated if there is either an increase in cardiac pre-load
(such as infusion of fluids) or increased pulmonary capillary
permeability (such as in pre-eclampsia) or both.
Labour is associated with further increases in cardiac output
(15% in the first stage and 500/0 in the second stage) Uterine
contractions lead to an auto-transfusion of 300—500 ml of blood
back into the circulation and the sympathetic response to pain
and anxiety further elevate the heart rate and blood pressure.
Cardiac output is increased between contractions but more so
during contractions.
Following delivery there is an immediate rise in cardiac
output due to relief of the inferior vena cava obstruction and
contraction of the uterus, which empties blood into the systemic
circulation. Cardiac output increases by 60—80%, followed by
a rapid decline to pre-labour values within about one hour of
delivery. Transfer of fluid from the extravascular space increases
venous return and stroke volume further.
Those women with cardiovascular compromise are therefore
most at risk of pulmorary oedema during the second stage of
labour and the immediate postpartum period. Cardiac output
has nearly returned to normal (pre-pregnancy values) two
weeks after delivery, although some pathological changes (e.g.
hypertension in pre-eclampsia) may take much longer.
The above physiological changes lead to changes on
cardiovascular examination that may be misinterpreted as
pathological by those unfamiliar with pregnancy. Changes may
include a bounding or collapsing pulse and an ejection systolic
murmur, present in over 90% of pregnant women. The murmur
may be loud and audible all over the precordium, with the first
heart sound loud and possibly sometimes a third heart sound.
There may be ectopic beats and peripheral oedema.
Normal findings on ECG in pregnancy that may partly relate
to changes in the position of the heart include:
• atrial and ventricular ectopics
Q wave (small) and inverted T wave in lead III
• ST-segment depression and T-wave inversion in the inferior
and lateral leads
• left-axis shift of QRS.
Adaptive changes in renal vasculature
The primary adaptive mechanism in pregnancy is a marked fall
in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) occurring by week six of
gestation. The 40% fall in SVR also affects the renal vasculature'
Despite a major increase in plasma volume during pregnancy, the
massive decrease in SVR creates a state of arterial under-filling
because 85% of the volume resides in the venous circulation:
This arterial under-filling state is unique to pregnancy. The fall
in SVR is combined with increased renal blood flow and this is in
contrast to other states of arterial under-filling, such as cirrhosis,
sepsis or arterio-venous fistulas.36
Relaxin, a peptide hormone produced by the corpus luteum,
decidua and placenta, plays an important role in the regulation
of haemodynamic and water metabolism during pregnancy.
Serum concentrations of relaxin, already elevated in the luteal
phase of the menstrual cycle, rise after conception to a peak at
the end of the first trimester and fall to an intermediate value
throughout the second and third trimester. Relaxin stimulates
the formation of endothelin, which in turn mediates vasodilation
of renal arteries via nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. 7
Despite activation of the renin—angiotensin—aldosterone
(RAA) system in early pregnancy, a simultaneous relative
resistance to angiotensin II develops, counterbalancing the
vasoconstrictive effect and allowing profound vasodilatation.8
This insensitivity to angiotensin II may be explained by the
effects of progesterone and vascular endothelial growth factor-
mediated prostacyclin production, as well as modifications in
the angiotensin I receptors during pregnancy.9 The vascular
refractoriness to angiotensin II may also be shared by other
vasoconstrictors such as adrenergic agonists and arginine
vasopressin (AVP).IO It is possible that in the second half of
pregnancy, the placental vasodilatators are more important in
the maintenance of the vasodilatatory state.6
Changes in renal anatomy and function
As a consequence of renal vasodilatation, renal plasma flow
and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) both increase, compared
to non-pregnant levels, by 40—65 and 50—85%, respectively. In
addition, the increase in plasma volume causes decreased oncotic
pressure in the glomeruli, with a subsequent rise in GFR.II
Vascular resistance decreases in both the renal afferent and
efferent arterioles and therefore, despite the massive increase in
renal plasma flow, glomerular hydrostatic pressure remains stable,
avoiding the development of glomerular hypertension. As the
GFR rises, both serum creatinine and urea concentrations decrease
to mean values of about 44.2 gmol/l and 3.2 mmol/l, respectively.

The increased renal blood flow leads to an increase in renal
size of 1—1.5 cm, reaching the maximal size by mid-pregnancy.
The kidney, pelvis and calyceal systems dilate due to mechanical
compressive forces on the ureters. Progesterone, which reduces
ureteral tone, peristalsis and contraction pressure, mediates these
anatomical changes. II The increase in renal size is associated with
an increase in renal vasculature, interstitial volume and urinary
dead space. There is also dilation of the ureters, renal pelvis
and calyces, leading to physiological hydronephrosis in over
80% of women.12 There is often a right-sided predominance of
hydronephrosis due to the anatomical circumstances of the right
ureter crossing the iliac and ovarian vessels at an angle before
entering the pelvis. Urinary stasis in the dilated collecting system
predisposes pregnant women with asymptomatic bacteriuria to
pyelonephritis.
There are also alterations in the tubular handling of wastes
and nutrients. As in the non-pregnant state, glucose is freely
filtered in the glomerulus. During pregnancy, the reabsorption of
glucose in the proximal and collecting tubule is less effective, with
variable excretion. About 90% of pregnant women with normal
blood glucose levels excrete 1—10 g of glucose per day. Due to the
increases in both GFR and glomerular capillary permeability to
albumin, the fractional excretion of protein may increase up to 300
mg/day and protein excretion also increases. In normal pregnancies
the total protein concentration in urine does not increase above
the upper normal limit. Uric acid excretion also increases due to
increased GFR and/or decreased tubular reabsorption. II
Body water metabolism
Arterial under-filling in pregnancy leads to the stimulation of
arterial baroreceptors, activating the RAA and the sympathetic
nervous systems. This results in a non-osmotic release of AVP
from the hypothalamus. These changes lead to sodium and
water retention in the kidneys and create a hypervolaemic, hypo-
osmolar state characteristic of pregnancy.6 Extracellular volume
increases by 30—50% and plasma volume by 30-40%. Maternal
blood volume increases by 45% to approximately 1 200 to 1 600
ml above non-pregnant values. By the late third trimester the
plasma volume increases by more than 50—60%, with a lower
increase in red blood cell mass, and therefore plasma osmolality
falls by 10 mosmol/kg. The increase in plasma volume plays
a critical role in maintaining circulating blood volume, blood
pressure and uteroplacental perfusion during pregnancy. 13
Activation of the RAA system leads to increased plasma
levels of aldosterone and subsequent salt and water retention in
the distal tubule and collecting duct. In addition to the increased
renin production by the kidneys, ovaries and uteroplacental
unit produce an inactive precursor protein of renin in early
pregnancy.14 The placenta also produces oestrogens that
stimulate the synthesis of angiotensinogen by the liver, resulting
in proportionally increased levels of aldosterone compared to
renin. Plasma levels of aldosterone correlate well with those of
oestrogens and rise progressively during pregnancy. The increase
in aldosterone is responsible for the increase in plasma volume
during pregnancy. Progesterone, which is a potent aldosterone
antagonist, allows natriuresis despite the sodium-retaining
properties of aldosterone. The rise in GFR also increases
distal sodium delivery, allowing excretion of excess sodium.
Progesterone has antikaliuretic effects and therefore excretion of
potassium is kept constant throughout pregnancy due to changes
in tubular reabsorption, and total body potassium increases
during pregnancy.6'15
Hypothalamic AVP release increases early in pregnancy as a
result of increased relaxin levels. AVP mediates an increase in water
reabsorption via aquaporin 2 channels in the collecting duct. The
threshold for hypothalamic secretion of AVP and the threshold
for thirst is reset to a lower plasma osmolality level, creating the
hypo-osmolar state characteristic of pregnancy. These changes are
mediated by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and relaxin.
11,16
In middle and late pregnancy there is a four-fold increase in
vasopressinase, an aminopeptidase produced by the placenta.
These changes enhance the metabolic clearance of vasopressin
and regulate the levels of active AVP. In conditions of increased
placental production of vasopressinase, such as pre-eclampsia or
twin pregnancies, a transient diabetes insipidus may develop. I
As a consequence of this volume expansion, the secretion of
atrial natriuretic peptides increases by 40% in the third trimester,
and rises further during the first week postpartum. The levels of
natriuretic peptides are higher in pregnant women with chronic
hypertension and pre-eclampsia.
Respiratory changes
There is a significant increase in oxygen demand during normal
pregnancy. This is due to a 15% increase in the metabolic rate
and a 20% increased consumption of oxygen. There is a 40—50%
increase in minute ventilation, mostly due to an increase in
tidal volume, rather than in the respiratory rate. This maternal
hyperventilation causes arterial p02 to increase and arterial
pC02 to fall, with a compensatory fall in serum bicarbonate to
18—22 mmol/l (see Table 1). A mild fully compensated respiratory
alkalosis is therefore normal in pregnancy (arterial pH 7.44).
Diaphragmatic elevation in late pregnancy results in decreased
functional residual capacity but diaphragmatic excursion and
therefore vital capacity remain unaltered. Inspiratory reserve
volume is reduced early in pregnancy, as a result of increased
tidal volume, but increases in the third trimester, as a result of
reduced functional residual capacity (see Fig. 1). Peak expiratory
flow rate (PEFR) and forced expiratory volume in one second
(FEVI) are unaffected by pregnancy.
Pregnancy may also be accompanied by a subjective feeling of
breathlessness without hypoxia. This is physiological and is most
common in the third trimester but may start at any time during
gestation. Classically, the breathlessness is present at rest or while
talking and may paradoxically improve during mild activity.
Adaptive changes in the alimentary tract
Nausea and vomiting are very common complaints in pregnancy,
affecting 50—90% of pregnancies. 19 This might be an adaptive

mechanism of pregnancy, aiming at preventing pregnant women
from consuming potentially teratogenic substances such as
strong-tasting fruits and vegetables. The exact underlying
mechanism is not clear but pregnancy-associated hormones
such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), oestrogen and
progesterone could to be involved in the aetiology. The levels of
hCG peak at the end of the first trimester when the trophoblast
is most actively producing hCG, correlating with the nausea
symptoms. Nausea is also more frequent in pregnancies with
high levels of hCG, such as in twin pregnancies.
Thyroid hormones may also be involved in the development
of nausea symptoms, as a strong association with nausea and
abnormal thyroid function tests has been found. Thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) and hCG have similar biomolecular
structures and therefore hCG cross-reacts with TSH, stimulating
the thyroid gland. 18 Psychological causes, genetic incompatibility,
immunological factors, nutritional deficiencies as well as
Helicobacter pylori infection have been proposed as aetiological
factors of nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.20
The nausea symptoms usually resolve by week 20 but
about 10—20% of the patients experience symptoms beyond
week 20 and some until the end of the pregnancy.21 In most
cases minor dietary modification and observation of electrolyte
balance is sufficient. About 0.5—30/0 of pregnant women develop
hyperemesis gravidum, a severe form of nausea and excessive
vomiting, often resulting in dehydration, electrolyte imbalance,
ketonuria, weight loss and vitamin or mineral deficiencies.
19,21
In these cases intravenous fluid and vitamin substitution is
commonly required. Thiamine supplementation is important in
order to avoid the development of Wernicke's encephalopathy.22
As pregnancy progresses, mechanical changes in the
alimentary tract also occur, caused by the growing uterus. The
stomach is increasingly displaced upwards, leading to an altered
axis and increased intra-gastric pressure. The oesophageal
sphincter tone is also decreased and these factors may predispose
to symptoms of reflux, as well as nausea and vomiting.23
Changes in oestrogen and progesterone levels also influence
the structural alterations in the gastrointestinal tract. These
include abnormalities in gastric neural activity and smooth
muscle function, leading to gastic dysrhythmia or gastroparesis.
The alterations are pronounced in women with pre-existing

gastrointestinal diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease,

Endocrine changes
Thyroid
There is an increase in the production of thyroxine-binding globulin
(TBG) by the liver, resulting in increased levels of thyroxine (TO
and tri-iodothyronine (T). Serum free T 4 (IT 4) and T; (fT3) levels
are slightly altered but are usually of no clinical significance. Levels
of free T 3 and T4 do however decrease slightly in the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy and the normal ranges are reduced.24
Free T; and T 4 are the physiologically important hormones and are
the main determinants of whether a patient is euthyroid.
Serum concentrations of TSH are decreased slightly in the
first trimester in response to the thyrotropic effects of increased
levels of human chorionic gonadotropin. Levels of TSH increase
again at the end of the first trimester, and the upper limit in
pregnancy is raised to 5.5 gmol/l compared with the level of 4.0
gmol/l in the non-pregnant state (Table 2).
Pregnancy is associated with a relative iodine deficiency. The
causes for this are active transport of iodine from the mother
to the foeto-placental unit and increased iodine excretion in the
urine. The World Health Organisation recommends an increase
in iodine intake in pregnancy from 100 to 150—200 mg/day.24 If
iodine intake is maintained in pregnancy, the size of the thyroid
gland remains unchanged and therefore the presence of goiter
should always be investigated. The thyroid gland is 25% larger in
patients who are iodine deficient.
Adrenal gland
Three types of steroids are produced by the adrenal glands:
mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids and sex steroids. The RAA
system is stimulated due to reductions in vascular resistance and
blood pressure, causing a three-fold increase in aldosterone levels
in the first trimester and a 10-fold increase in the third trimester.
25,26
Levels of angiotensin II are increased two- to four-fold and renin
activity is increased three to four times that of non-pregnant values.
During pregnancy there is also an increase in serum levels
of deoxycorticosterone, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG),
adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACT H), cortisol and free cortisol.
These changes cause a state of physiological hypercortisolism and
may be clinically manifested by the striae, facial plethora, rising
blood pressure or impaired glucose tolerance." Total cortisol levels
increase at the end of the first trimester and are three times higher
than non-pregnant values at the end of pregnancy. Hypercortisolism
in late pregnancy is also the result of the production of corticotropin-
releasing hormone by the placenta — one of the triggers for the onset
of labour. Diurnal variations in ACTH and cortisol levels are
maintained. The hypothalamic—pituitary axis response to exogenous
glucocorticoids is blunted during pregnancy.

Pituitary gland
The pituitary gland enlarges in pregnancy and this is mainly due
to proliferation of prolactin-producing cells in the anterior lobe.
Serum prolactin levels increase in the first trimester and are 10
times higher at term. The increase in prolactin is most likely due
to increasing serum oestradiol concentrations during pregnancy.
Levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising
hormone (LH) are undetectable during pregnancy due to the
negative feedback from elevated levels of oestrogen, progesterone
and inhibin.28 Pituitary growth hormone production is decreased
but serum growth hormone levels are increased due to growth
hormone production from the placenta.
The posterior pituitary produces oxytocin and arginine
vasopressin (AVP). Oxytocin levels increase in pregnancy
and peak at term. Levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
remain unchanged but the decrease in sodium concentration in
pregnancy causes a decrease in osmolality. There is therefore a
resetting of osmoreceptors for ADH release and thirst.29
Glucose metabolism
Pregnancy is a diabetogenic state and the adaptations in glucose
metabolism allow shunting of glucose to the foetus to promote
development, while maintaining adequate maternal nutrition.30
Insulin-secreting pancreatic beta-cells undergo hyperplasia, resulting
in increased insulin secretion and increased insulin sensitivity in
early pregnancy, followed by progressive insulin resistance."
Maternal insulin resistance begins in the second trimester
and peaks in the third trimester. This is the result of increasing
secretion of diabetogenic hormones such as human placental
lactogen, growth hormone, progesterone, cortisol and prolactin.
These hormones cause a decrease in insulin sensitivity in the
peripheral tissues such as adipocytes and skeletal muscle by
interfering with insulin receptor signalling.32 The effect of
the placental hormones on insulin sensitivity is made evident
postpartum when there is a sudden decrease in insulin resistance.33
Insulin levels are increased in both the fasting and postprandial
states in pregnancy. Fasting glucose levels are however decreased
due to:
• increased storage of tissue glycogen
• increased peripheral glucose use
• decrease in glucose production by the liver
• uptake of glucose by the foetus.34
Insulin resistance and relative hypoglycaemia results in lipolysis,
allowing the pregnant mother to preferentially use fat for fuel,
preserving the available glucose and amino acids for the foetus and
minimising protein catabolism. The placenta allows transfer of
glucose, amino acids and ketones to the foetus but is impermeable
to large lipids. If a woman's endocrine pancreatic function is
impaired, and she is unable to overcome the insulin resistance
associated with pregnancy then gestational diabetes develops.
Lipid metabolism
There is an increase in total serum cholesterol and triglyceride
levels in pregnancy. The increase in triglyceride levels is mainly as a
result of increased synthesis by the liver and decreased lipoprotein
lipase activity, resulting in decreased catabolism of adipose tissue.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels also increase
and reach 50% at term. High-density lipoprotein levels increase
in the first half of pregnancy and fall in the third trimester but
concentrations are 15% higher than non-pregnant levels.
Changes in lipid metabolism accommodate the needs of the
developing foetus. Increased triglyceride levels provide for the
mother's energy needs while glucose is spared for the foetus.
The increase in LDL cholesterol is important for placental
steroidogenesis.
Protein metabolism
Pregnant women require an increased intake of protein during
pregnancy. Amino acids are actively transported across the
placenta to fulfill the needs of the developing foetus. During
pregnancy, protein catabolism is decreased as fat stores are used
to provide for energy metabolism.
Calcium metabolism
The average foetus requires about 30 g of calcium to maintain its
physiological processes. Most of this calcium is transferred to the
foetus during the third trimester and is derived from increased
dietary absorption by the mother.35 There is a decrease in total
serum calcium concentration during pregnancy. This is mainly
due to a decrease in serum albumin levels due to haemodilution,
resulting in a decrease in the albumin-bound fraction of calcium.
However the physiologically important fraction, serum ionised
calcium, remains unchanged.36 Therefore maternal serum levels
of calcium are maintained during pregnancy and foetal needs are
met by increased intestinal absorption, which doubles from 12
weeks' gestation. However the peak demand for calcium is only
in the third trimester. This early increase in calcium absorption
may allow the maternal skeleton to store calcium in advance.l
Serum levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D increase and this is
metabolised further into I. 25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The increase
in 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D is directly responsible for the
increase in intestinal calcium absorption.36
Increased calcium absorption is associated with an increase in
calcium excretion in the urine and these changes begin from 12
weeks. During periods of fasting, urinary calcium values are low
or normal, confirming that hypercalciuria is the consequence of
increased absorption.35 Pregnancy is therefore a risk factor for
kidney stones.
Skeletal and bone density changes
There is controversy regarding the effect of pregnancy on maternal
bone loss. Although pregnancy and lactation are associated with
reversible bone loss, studies do not support an association between
parity and osteoporosis in later life.25 Bone turnover is low in the
first trimester and increases in the third trimester when foetal
calcium needs are increased. The source of the calcium in the third
trimester is previously stored skeletal calcium.36
A study of bone biopsies in pregnancy has shown a change
in the micro-architectural pattern of bone in pregnancy but not
overall bone mass.36 The changes reflect the need for the maternal
skeleton to be resistant to bending forces and biochemical
stresses needed to carry the growing foetus.
Other musculoskeletal changes seen in pregnancy include:
• exaggerated lordosis of the lower back, forward flexion of the
neck and downward movement of the shoulders

Abstract
Objective
The morbidity and mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage has been increased since 201 6 in China,
in addition, promoting vaginal delivery is an important task in China currently. This study aimed to
develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to predict postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal
delivery women.
Design:
A retrospective cohort study.
Methods
We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records among 1 587 vaginal delivery women, who had
visited the obstetrics clinic at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from 2018 to 2020,
these women then were randomly divided into a training set (70%), a validation set (15%) and a test set
(15%). We adopted a univariate logistic regression model to select the significant features (P < 0.01).
Afterward, we trained several artificial neural networks and binary logistic regression to predict the
postpartum hemorrhage, the neural networks included multi-layer perceptron (MLP), back propagation
(BP) and radial basis function (RBF). In order to compare and identify the most accurate network, we
used the confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. We finally developed a
clinical decision support system based on the most accurate network. All statistical analyses were
performed by IBM SPSS (version 20), and MATLAB 2013b software was applied to develop the clinical
decision support system.
Results
Initially, 45 potential variables were addressed by the univariate logistic regression, 1 6 significant
predictors were then selected to enter the binary logistic regression and neural networks (P-value < 0.01 ).
After validation, the best performing model was the multi-layer perceptron network with the highest
discriminative ability (AUC 0.862, 95% Cl 0.838-0.887). Followed by the back propagation model (AUC
0.866; Cl 0.842-0.890), the logistic regression model (AUC 0.856; Cl 0.832-0.880). The radial
basis function model (AUC 0.845; 95% Cl 0.820-0.870) had lower discriminative ability.
Conclusion
Page 2/24


In summary, in terms of predicting postpartum hemorrhage, the multi-layer perceptron network performed
better than the back propagation network, logistic regression model, and radial basis function network.
The developed clinical decision support system based on the multi-layer perceptron network is expected
to promote early identification of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery women, thereby improve the
quality of obstetric care and the maternal outcome.
What Is Already Known About The Topic?
• Postpartum hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide.
• Due to the heterogeneity of discriminant criteria and risk factors between cesarean section and
vaginal delivery, there are some limitations in predicting postpartum hemorrhage using the same
warning model for different mode of delivery.
• Current prediction models for postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery are linear algorithm that
divide events into possible or not possible. However, most obstetrics events are not as black and
white.
What this paper adds
• We developed the first midwifery-led clinical decision support system model based on artificial neural
network (ANN) algorithm for prediction of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery.
• This study demonstrated that the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network had the most accurate
prediction ability, followed by the back propagation (BP) network, the logistic regression model, and
the radial basis function (RBF) network.
• This study could enrich the practice of artificial intelligence in nursing informatization.
1. Introduction
Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide,
[l -2] it
accounting for 29.3% of maternal deaths and 26.7% of adverse pregnancy outcomes, respectively
[31. In
makes up 9.3% of maternal deaths in developed countries, while 45.7% in developing countries
developed countries, postpartum hemorrhage has fallen to the third as a direct cause of maternal death,
after pregnancy hypertension and thromboembolism, however, it remains the leading cause of maternal
death in developing countries
In China, with the opening of "two-child policy" from 201 6, more and more elderly pregnant women have
become the potential population of postpartum hemorrhage. The increasing trial of labor after a previous
cesarean section (TOLAC) and elective repeated cesarean section (ERCS) caused by previous one-child
policy, also deteriorate the risk of obstetric hemorrhage. Maternal mortality has been decreasing and
seems to reach a bottleneck since 1998 in China, but the mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage is
Page 3/24


increasing, compared with 201 5, the maternal mortality caused by postpartum hemorrhage increased by
1 50/0 in 201 6, to 23.5%, and increased to 29.0% in 201 711].
The cesarean section rate in China rose from 34.1 % in 2016 to 36.6% in 201 911], far from the 15%
recommended by the World Health Organization thereby, promoting vaginal delivery is an important
task in Chinese obstetrics department now. As a decision-maker for early warning of postpartum
hemorrhage during the vaginal delivery, midwives often rely on their own experience to judge and have
not yet formed a unified decision standard [5]. On the one hand, prediction and decision-making for
postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery is a formidable task for midwives. Multiple factors have
varying influence on the occurrence of hemorrhage among vaginal delivery women, nonlinear relations
between risk factors and postpartum hemorrhage make it more complicate as well [6]. On the other hand,
the qualification of most Chinese midwives is college or technical secondary school education, and
standardized training of midwives is low in China, as well.
The objective of this study is to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) to solve above
problems. A clinical decision support system is invented to help physicians make appropriate decisions
for patients, it uses artificial intelligence algorithm to solve semi-structured or unstructured clinical
problem. Clinical decision support system not only is a principle and method based on the knowledge
reasoning and logic operation to acquire and process relevant patient data from the electronic medical
records automatically, but also is an auxiliary decision-making system which provide decision-makers
with valuable information at the right time by the human-computer interaction Clinical decision
support system is considered to be the inevitable trend of the combination of medicine and artificial
intelligence [8-9]. Chinese government issued many policies to promote the sustainable development of
[10], the notice of national hospital informatization construction focusing on
medical informatization
electronic medical records by the National Health Commission in 201 8 [1 1], pointed out that clinical
nursing decision support system should realize intelligent input, intelligent generation, intelligent
reminder, quality control and rectification of nursing records and other functions.
Data-driven clinical decision support system based on a large amount of electronic medical record data
can be divided into case reasoning system and machine learning system, a good machine learning
algorithms can extract personalized features from data and summarize patterns to achieve high
[12]. Current algorithms of prediction model for postpartum hemorrhage adopted by the
accuracy
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the California Maternal Quality Care
[1 3], decision tree
Collaborative (CMQCC) include logistic regression
, random forest and extreme
gradient boosting [15]. Most of them are linear prediction that divides events into possible or not possible.
However, as real life has shown, most events are not as black and white. Rather than other liner
algorithms, artificial neural network (ANN) is a multi-layer complex model formed by connecting neurons
(perceptron) through synapses (weights) [16]. ANN has strong nonlinear mapping ability to address high-
dimensional data, it can also reasonably predict and modify the relationship between input variables and
output variables. ANN models possess strong feature of self-adaption, self-organizing, self-learning and
Page 4/24


tolerate faults [17]. In recent years, ANN has been applied to medical research, such as prediction of
disease diagnosis and prognosis, prediction of nursing adverse events, which has proven high superiority
[18-21]
Therefore, this study aims to build a scientific midwifery-led clinical decision support system based on
ANN algorithm for prediction of postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery, which will provide a practical
theoretical basis for improving the success rate of treatment and reducing the mortality of postpartum
hemorrhage.
2. Material And Methods
2.1. Data source and data collection
In order to identify the potential variables, we first conducted a literature system review and a Delphi
method with obstetricians and midwives. We adopted the search strategy to find relevant literature as
follows: (postpartum hemorrhage OR PPH OR transfusion) AND (predictor* OR risk factor*) AND (vaginal
delivery OR vaginal birth) in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Springer, Elsevier SD and Wiley. We read
related papers published in English from 2006. Moreover, we considered current medical evidence and
obstetricians' consultations. We identified 54 potential variables regarding this; however, five of these 54
variables (residence, history of postpartum hemorrhage, pre-pregnancy weight, antenatal steroids, and
antepartum infection) were not registered in the electronic medical records. Hence, we designed the data
collection form and collected another 49 variables manually (Appendix 1). The needed data was
retrospectively collected from the medical records of vaginal delivery women who had visited the
obstetrics clinic at our hospital (the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University) in Zhengzhou,
China from 201 8 to 2020. We also tried to use the Maternal and Child Health Information Network of
Henan Province to collect large data, but some essential elements were not available in the information
system, so we collected complete data manually. Two trained researchers (first author and second
author) extracted the data from the electronic medical records.
Out of 28765 registered vaginal deliveries from the electronic medical records, we excluded any patients
who underwent (1) antenatal fetal demise, (2) gestations under 35 weeks, (3) caesarean section, (4) late
postpartum hemorrhage, (5) hematological and neoplastic disorders, (6) severe liver diseases, (7)
incomplete medical records 2 30%, and (8) death before childbirth. According to these criteria, only 1 587
of these deliveries were available and eligible for study. The final dataset included the 49 potential
predictor variables and bleeding or not outcomes of these cases. Next, these women were randomly
divided into a training set (70%), a validation set (15%) and a test set (15%).
2.2. Pre-processing and feature selection
The outcomes event of postpartum hemorrhage was defined as blood loss at least 500mL within 24
hours after the fetus is vaginally delivered. This outcome was selected because it was consistent with the
most recent definition from "Guidelines for the Prevention and Management of Postpartum Hemorrhage
Page 5/24


(2014)" issued by Obstetrics Division, Obstetrics and Gynecology Branch, Chinese Medical Association
[22], the literature of "obstetrics and gynecology" (published by People's Medical Publishing House in
201 3, 8th Edition) [23]
, as well as the consensus definition of the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists [24], and the World Health Organization
There were data values missing for some variables, we used the multiple imputation to impute missing
data values for variables in model. This approach has been recommended by the prediction model risk of
bias assessment tool (PROBAST) [26] and applied in previous study [27].
Numerous variables will lead to over-fitting of the model and increase the clinic burden. Therefore, the pre-
processing techniques were frequently used to reduce dimension or select feature. This step can
eliminate irrelevant, weakly relevant, or less important features. Variable screening is an important
procedure to improve the overall stability of the model. We selected variables using the "backward
method" and the univariate logistic regression performed by IBM SPSS software (version 20). 7 variables
were finally identified as input neurons, and the standardized importance of each variable was shown on
a scale with a maximum value of 1 00, to understand the contribution of each variable in the machine
learning model (Fig. 1).
2.3. Establishment of artificial neural network models and
logistic regression (LR) model
The artificial neural networks and LR models of postpartum hemorrhage were built based on the
identified predictors from the previous step.
2.3.1. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network
The MLP neural network consists of one input layer, one or more hidden layer and one output layer. The
neuron is the basic component of the network. Neurons include input neurons, hidden layer neurons and
output neurons. MLP is a multi-layer feedforward neural network, it has advantages of processing
nonlinear data, good fault tolerance and strong self-learning ability [17]. The MLP network model can pass
the data among each neuron in direction, and excavate the internal deep connections between the input
data, whose learning process mainly includes the forward transmission of data and the back propagation
of errors. This kind of feedback learning method can reasonably change the weight and bias of each
input so that obtain the best prediction ability for the model [28]. The number of neurons in hidden layer
can be automatically calculated by SPSS software and the relative optimal number of neurons can be
get.
2.3.2. The Back Propagation (BP) network
BP neural network is multi-layer feedforward neural network based on gradient descent algorithm, it is
trained according to the error back propagation algorithm, and has been the most widely used neural
network, which is composed of input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Activation function between
Page 6/24


layer and layer is Sigmoid type differentiable function, the error is propagated back to the input layer from
back to front layer by layer, the link weight is adjusted constantly in order to realize arbitrary nonlinear
mapping between input and output [1 9' 29'30]. The internal Sigmoid function was automatically calculated
by SPSS and the relative optimal function parameters were obtained.
2.3.3. The radial basis function (RBF) network
The RBF neural network consists of input layer, radial basis layer and output layer, the input layer is made
up of signal source nodes; the radial basis layer is a nonlinear radially symmetric function that is
attenuated to the center point according to specific needs; the output layer is the output result of input
layer processed by radial basis function [21]. RBF neural network is a kind of forward conduction neural
network which is applicable to solve classification problems. It can approximate any continuous function
with any precision so that achieve the optimal prediction ability by adjusting the parameters of the radial
[30]. The internal radial basis function was automatically calculated by SPSS and the
basis function
relative optimal function parameters were obtained.
2.4. Evaluation of the networks and development of the
CDSS
Firstly, in order to identify the best-performed model based on a given dataset, we not only developed five
models for the MLP network, RBF network and BP network, respectively, but also constructed the binary
logistic regression to compare the performance of the traditional statistical analysis model and the
artificial neural network model. Secondly, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of each
model in training set, validation set, test set were plotted by R 3.6.3 software. We used the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy to evaluate and select the
most accurate model. In addition, we also conducted the internal validation by 1 0-fold cross. Finally, we
designed the CDSS based on the most accurate network by MATLAB 2013b software to reach
visualization.
2.5. Ethical and legal considerations
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
University and followed the ethical guidelines set by the Helsinki Declaration of the World Medical
Congress (2019-135-01
3. Results
3.1. Identifying significant variables for predicting
postpartum hemorrhage in vaginal delivery
Originally, we identified 54 variables that is likely to affect the postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal
delivery women (Appendix 1). Among the 1 587 deliveries included, 1307 (82.4%) just occurred
Page 7/24


physiological blood loss (less than 500 ml), in addition, there were 280 (17.6%) cases of postpartum
hemorrhage (31 of blood loss more than 1 000 ml and 249 of blood loss between 500-1000 ml).
After performing the univariable logistic regression, the most significant fifteen factors with P-value < 0.01
were selected for predicting the postpartum hemorrhage (Table 1). Tables 1 demonstrated the distribution
of these factors in our total dataset for bleeding and not bleeding, respectively. Figure 1 showed the
variable importance in the selected MLP model which had the best discrimination ability. The top 10
variables, ranked from most to least important, were white blood cells (WBC) during the first labor stage,
newborn weight, cervical laceration, history of uterine surgery, parity, manual removal of placenta,
episiotomy, placenta previa, operative vaginal delivery, uterine curettage, assisted reproduction,
velamentous placenta, threatened abortion, induced labor, and placental abruption.

3.2.4. Developing the CDSS
To compare the performance of MLP, BP, RBF, and LR model, we put the four ROC curves of the four
models together in the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively (Fig. 2). As shown in the Table
6 and Fig. 2, after the validation, best performing model was the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network
with the highest discriminative ability (AUC 0.862, 95% Cl 0.838-0.887). Followed by the BP model (AUC
0.866; Cl 0.842-0.890), logistic regression (AUC 0.856; Cl 0.832-0.880). The RBF model (AUC
0.845; 95% Cl 0.820-0.870) had lower discriminative ability. The MLP network had the best performance
in the training data and test data, as well (Table 6).

Finally, we selected the Network 5 of MLP for developing the CDSS. The graphical user interface of this
CDSS was displayed in Fig. 3. As seen in this figure, obstetricians can easily input the values of the 1 5
variables and get the result of prediction for the postpartum hemorrhage
Page 12/24


4. Discussion
We preliminarily constructed and validated three ANN models to predict postpartum hemorrhage in
vaginal delivery women. The MLP model indicated the best predictive ability in all groups of training,
validation and test. Moreover, compared with the traditional logistic regression model, both MLP and BP
models showed better discrimination ability to predict postpartum hemorrhage. In addition, A user-
friendly CDSS was developed according to the MLP model.
In terms of clinical application, midwives could prepare full in advance for example triage expectant
mothers with high risk of postpartum hemorrhage to the corresponding obstetric care level and initiate
interventions. Prediction of our model mainly focused on the time of labor and birth, therefore, we
adopted the variables available during the same instances. It is also appropriate to construct prediction
model employing high-risk factors after delivery, such as cervical lacerations and newborn weight.
Importantly, in order to facilitate clinical use immediately, we recommend the information departments in
hospital to integrate the aid decision-making system in electronic medical records, in the form of a risk
calculator or outputting the result automatically. When a pregnant woman is laboring by an obstetrician,
the midwife or other assistant could input the numerical values of the 1 5 predictors into the built CDSS
(Fig. 3), and the prediction outcome (postpartum hemorrhage or non-postpartum hemorrhage) would be
output by clicking the button of "submit" in the designed interface of the system. Once the system
identifies some pregnancy women as postpartum hemorrhage, the one should be considered carefully by
the obstetricians. According to the predicted outcome, the obstetricians can make optimal decision for
the pregnancy women about personalized treatment in the next step. In this way, the obstetrician can
manage the labor stage more skillfully by early identification, early warning, early treatment, in order to
mitigate adverse outcome for these high-risk patients. For example, midwives can make pre-transfusion
preparations for high-risk patients in advance, cross-match blood tests, and inform the blood transfusion
department to prepare blood products, particularly fresh frozen plasma can take up an hour to thaw. At
the same time, it is conducive to the rational allocation of medical resources by arranging high-risk
bleeding women for delivering in different time to avoid insufficient staff resources.
In recent years, medical institutions and obstetric experts at home and abroad have made a lot of
exploration in the early warning evaluation and prediction of postpartum hemorrhage. The risk score
calculators formulated by them for different subgroups of people could indicate the possibility of
postpartum hemorrhage to some extent and achieved certain results. Ana [31] developed and validated a
predictive model based on the binary logistic regression and the ridge regression to measure the risk of
excessive blood loss in 2336 vaginal delivery women, but this analysis only collected thirteen variables
and the sensitivity was low. Michelle [32] trained and tested a logistic regression prediction models
involving 74 variables for hemorrhage and transfusion by a data set from 63973 deliveries, however, the
results were not visualized. Kartic [1 5] et al. used two traditional statistical models (logistic regression with
and without lasso regularization) and two machine learning models (random forest and extreme gradient
boosting) to predict postpartum hemorrhage, the extreme gradient boosting model showed the best in
both the discrimination and decision curve analysis, but some variables in the model were difficult to
Page 13/24


collect so that limited the clinical practicability. Ahmadzia et al. [33] developed an online calculator for
postpartum hemorrhage risk scores, Dunkerton [34] et al. established a decision tree model for postpartum
hemorrhage prediction based on a non-parametric recursion algorithm, Bingnan Chen [35]
created a
nomogram model to predict postpartum hemorrhage individually, however, all of them were only used for
cesarean section population. Due to the heterogeneity of discriminant criteria and risk factors between
cesarean section and vaginal delivery, there are some limitations in predicting postpartum hemorrhage
using the same warning model for different mode of delivery. In addition, most of current prediction
models for postpartum hemorrhage were linear algorithms, logistic regression is a traditional statistics
algorithm which can screen out the limited variables associated with postpartum hemorrhage and
eliminate confounding variables [36]. However, when there are too many variables to observe, the LR
neither detect complicated nonlinear relationships between independent and dependent variables, nor has
the ability to address collinearity between variables, so some potential valid variables were removed [37]
Compare with above models, our study indicated that both neural network and logistic regression can
provide excellent discrimination for the prediction of postpartum hemorrhage, hence, a finally selected
model to build a CDSS should rely on a combination of model performance (discrimination, calibration
[38]
and net benefit), clinical applicability, and acceptability by obstetricians and expectant women
The ANN prediction model established in this paper aims to provide personalized prediction results and
achieve effective risk stratification. The results of our study revealed that the ANN model was more
accurate to predict postpartum hemorrhage among vaginal delivery. At present, the ANN model has been
widely used in disease prediction and diagnosis, chronic disease management, medical image
recognition and other aspects [16-21], it had shown superior performance than conventional predictive
models even employing the same input variables [1 6'21]. Postpartum hemorrhage, as an obstetric
emergency, has various factors and complex mechanism. If we take the epidemiological data and use the
traditional linear discriminant function to predict it, there are great limitations. As an information
processing system abstracted from biological neural network, ANN has the ability of self-learning and
identifying the relationship between variables, which can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions with
arbitrary accuracy [17]. Previous studies implied that neural network models reflected a stronger fit to
address complex nonlinear relationships and cost less effort to generate than the traditional regression
algorithms [18-21]. It is imperative that ANN techniques automatically conduct variables selection, missing
values imputing and other data preprocessing procedures.
There was a lot of literature support for the included variables as risk factors for PPH. Almost all the
variables in our model are clinically available and have been identified in previous models, including
newborn weight, cervical laceration, history of uterine surgery, parity, manual removal of placenta,
episiotomy [31-35'38]. However, one important predictor that has not been considered yet is the WBC count
during the first stage of labor, it is identified of 100% importance in this study, which extended the
previous work in predicting PPH and may provide insights of underlying pathophysiology links between
inflammation participation and PPH onset. In our results, the WBC count of hemorrhage women were
higher than that of non-hemorrhage women during the first stage of labor. Possible reasons for this may
Page 14/24


be as follows: infection leads to weak state of pregnancy women and those were vulnerable to PPH, and
labor is a state of stress which also leads high WBC count [39'40]. Further, more clinical laboratory studies
are needed to uncover the underlying pathophysiology mechanism between high WBC count during the
first stage of labor and postpartum hemorrhage. Our outcomes for the WBC showed a 100% standardized
importance, this point maybe because the sample size was large, but the morbidity of PPH was low and
the number of cases was small in this model. Nevertheless, another statistical algorithm was conducted
(binary logistic regression) to explore the odds ratio (OR) of the variables and confirm their statistical
significance.
The second important risk factor was the newborn weight of 75.5% standardized importance in our study,
which again matched previous studies [1 3' 1 24 31]. This may because that increased newborn weight is
associated with hyperextension of uterine muscle fibers and affects uterine contractions. In addition,
pregnant women with large fetal weight may have other complications, such as cephalic pelvic
asymmetricity, prolonged first and second stages of labor, shoulder dystocia, laceration of the soft birth
canal, uterine contraction [41], which also increases the incidence of postpartum hemorrhage. The
newborn weight in our study was postpartum variable when the risk period of bleeding had passed, we
can consider introducing a prenatal diagnosis of macrosomia or estimated fetal weight according to the
ultrasound into model. Some other risk factors in our model for hemorrhage have been accepted
generally, namely operative vaginal delivery, induced labor, manual removal of placenta, episiotomy and
[2'3'6'31-35], despite their fewer links to hemorrhage with standardized importance less than
cervical tears
30%, the less noticeable whose effect is, the more severe the situation goes.
4.1. Limitations
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, neural network algorithms are driven by big data and rely on a
large sample size. We developed a CDSS based on electronic medical record from only one center, the
sample size was far insufficient, the external validation was just conducted in our hospital, so the result
may be not generalizable, robust internal and external validation is needed before promotion and
application widely. Secondly, Missing data is another limitation of our study, the study was restricted in
the part of valid blood loss data from the original dataset, the missing value of the covariable accounted
for a considered proportion, though we adopted multiple imputation techniques reported by the PROBAST
[26], the proportion of incomplete data also limited the generalization of the model. Furthermore, it is more
likely that the missing values will continue to hinder integrating the models into electronic medical
records. Thirdly, the predictors in our study all were static, hourly data such as temperature, heart rate,
systolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation, physical examination findings were not included.
In addition, despite embedding all risk factors in the CDSS will be promising, but it may increase clinical
workload burden and could potentially delay intervention [42]. The impact of a model on aiding decision
making depends on multiple characteristics of health providers and circumstances, including ability to
initiate immediately intervene response and weigh the risks against benefits, capacity to take actions, and
Page 15/24


[43]. Other
expectant women (or obstetricians) compliance with the recommended measures
environmental restrictions consist of staff, space, and facilities, which are not considered into current
CDSS. Meanwhile, estimated blood loss (EBL) is considered to be inaccurate, subjective and always
underestimated, there is a mismatch between the actual blood loss and the vital signs, urine volume and
mental state of the individual shown. A physical compensatory period of blood loss exists in the early
bleeding stage [44-45]. Our definition of postpartum hemorrhage followed the current clinical guidelines
[22-25] however, we did not evaluate other relevant clinical indicators of acute blood loss, including a deep
perineal hematoma from a laceration of the birth canal, blood flow velocity and properties, the bleeding
was fluid or turbulent or exudative, and whether it clotted or contained clots [46]. The blood loss in
predictive models needs to be measured by means of the quantitative blood loss (QBL) methods, such as
basic methemoglobin colorimetric method [47] or image spectral analysis [45], Shock Index (Sl) [48] and so
on.
5. Conclusions
In summary, we developed a CDSS based on the risk factors identified by artificial neural network
algorithms. This ANN model performed better than logistic regression in predicting the postpartum
hemorrhage of vaginal delivery women. In the future, these findings will enrich nursing informational
practice to promote the application of artificial intelligence technology (such as ANN algorithm) in the
field of nursing. As predictive tools become more widely used in obstetric care, they can be introduced
into clinical guidelines and care pathways after further testing. Identification high risk mother of
postpartum hemorrhage on labor admission using the clinical decision-making system will benefit
accurate prenatal diagnosis and prompt intervention, which may lead to optimize obstetric care, improve
maternal prognosis, and rational allocation of medical resource.

ABSTRACT
Objective: Somalia has high rates of maternal mortality, fertility and pregnancy among young women. Factors
contributing to this situation are a lack of knowledge regarding sexual and reproductive health, early marriages,
cultural norms and the unmet need for or use of contraceptives. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of
family planning among young men and women with tertiary education in Mogadishu.
Methods: A purposeful and convenience strategy using snowballing was used to recruit participants. Four focus
group discussions were held online with 26 young women and men aged 19—25 years old. All participants were
studying at five different universities in Mogadishu, and only one participant was married. The data were
analysed using thematic analysis.
Findings: The findings showed that participants objected to the concept of family planning but supported the
concept of child spacing. They highlighted that people of their generation with tertiary education practise child
spacing to combine careers with family life. Although all the participants knew of the benefits of child spacing,
they had different opinions on whether modern contraceptive methods were an option for them. They were more
comfortable with traditional contraceptive methods and believed that the quality of the modern contraceptive
medicine available in the country was unreliable.
Conclusiorr Our findings suggest that it is crucial not only to include young people in family planning awareness
initiatives and implementation but also to give them a voice to advocate family planning and start dialogues
within their own communities.
While efforts have been made to improve the sexual and reproduc-
tive health of young people globally, studies continue to report high
fertility rates among young people living in Africa
. In Somalia, in
[1]
Sub-Saharan Africa, young people aged 15—25 years old, constitute
approximately 55% of the total population
, and high rates of fertility
[2]
and pregnancy have been reported among young women
The
[3]
maternal mortality rate in Somalia is also one of the highest in the world,
with 829/100 000 live births 4]. The latest Somali Health and De-
mographic Survey
showed that the proportion of girls who begin
[3]
childbearing in their teenage years is rising. Childbearing at a young age
has great consequences for women, infant health and society
From
the health perspective, early childbearing and a high fertility rate are
associated with maternal and neonatal mortality, pregnancy-related
complications, low birth weight and psychological distress
From a
societal perspective, the risks include high school drop-out rates, poor
socioeconomic outcomes and the generational transmission of marrying
children at a young age
. Factors contributing to a high fertility rate
[6,7]
among young people are early marriages, cultural norms, a lack of
knowledge regarding sexual and reproductive health and the unmet
need for or use of contraceptives
For the last three decades, Somalia has suffered from civil war,
conflict and humanitarian crises, which have led to fragility in the

healthcare system and poor access to essential healthcare services,
particularly family planning services
Investing in family planning is
crucial to achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs)
[10]. It
also contributes to improving maternal health, reducing maternal
mortality and morbidity and enhancing gender equality and women's
. Family planning further allows both women and
[11]
empowerment
men to access accurate information regarding which contraceptive
methods can support them in their reproductive preferences
[10,11]
The knowledge that modern contraceptive methods are effective in
family planning and preventing unintended pregnancies has been
widely transmitted in Sub-Saharan Africa; yet the uptake of these con-
traceptive methods remains low, which is a great concern for achieving
the SDGs [11-13]
. In Somalia, only 7% of married women use modern
contraceptive methods, and only half of the women aged 15—24 years
old have heard of these methods
This indicates a low level of
knowledge about contraceptive methods among young people living in
Somalia. However, the knowledge of contraceptive methods among
Somali women in Somalia increases by age and education
[3,14]. For
instance, 59.4% of women without education had knowledge of con-
traceptive methods compared to 89.5% of women with education
Evidence confirms that education and economic are important fac-
tors for women's fertility rate and use of family planning
[15,16]
However, sociocultural norms may counteract and contribute to
women's use of family planning and preferences for larger family sizes
In many Islamic countries, including Somalia, birth spacing is
[17-19]
permitted, but limiting children, as family planning is interpreted, is
discouraged
. Several studies have shown that Somali women prefer
[19]
to have many children to enhance their status in society [14 . However,
a recent study of Somali men living in Sweden showed that these men re-
evaluated the ideal family size when living in a context outside Somalia,
although social pressure continued to be a factor in maintaining a large
family size
While other studies of Somali men living in Sub-
[20]
Saharan Africa have also shown varying opinions about family size, all
the studies confirmed that knowledge about modern contraception is
low [21]
Given this context, it is important to investigate young people's
perceptions of family planning and contraceptive methods to design

planning among young men and women with tertiary education and
living in Mogadishu.
Methods
Design
The study employed a qualitative exploratory design using focus
group discussions (FGDs). An exploratory design is useful when little
knowledge exists on the phenomenon to be explored
[24]
. FGDs were
chosen because they facilitate the exploration of a phenomenon from
different points of view
allowing the authors to examine how the
[25],
phenomenon of family planning is perceived collectively by young
women and men living in Mogadishu, Somalia.
Setting, recruiment and participants
The study was carried out in Somalia's capital city, Mogadishu,
which is located in the Banadir region. The city is highly urbanised, with
approximately 2.3 million inhabitants and is administratively divided
into 17 districts. A purposeful, convenience sample of young men and
women living in Mogadishu was recruited to participate in FGDs. The
inclusion criteria were that the participants were young men and women
under 26 years old who lived in Mogadishu. The first author recruited
participants using the snowballing method. Information about the study
Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare 35 (2023) 100828
was posted on Facebook. This strategy was due to the COVID pandemic
and difficulties recruiting participants from other settings such as mos-
ques, coffee shops or schools. It is also estimated that 86% of Somali
youth have access to smartphones and the internet
. Potential par-
[26]
ticipants who showed interest contacted the first author, and those who
met the eligibility criteria were invited to information meetings and to
participate in an FGD if they agreed. They were then encouraged to
invite peers to participate by coming to the information meeting or
contacting the first author. In total, 29 participants showed an interest in
and received information about the study and were asked for their
consent to participate. At the time of the FGDs, two participants could
not attend due to bad internet connectivity, and one participant could
not participate due to time constraints. Therefore, 26 participants were
included in four FGDs.
As shown in
17 females and nine males aged 19—24 years
Table 1,
participated in the FGDs. This study did not aim to recruit university
students exclusively; however, the majority of the participants (92%)
were carrying out their undergraduate studies in medicine, nursing,
public health or management programmes at five different universities
in Mogadishu. This might be due to the information about the study
being posted on Facebook, but also, those who have been recruited
through snowballing were invited by their peers who were studying at
the university. In addition, two participants had master's degrees in
public health and management, and only one of the participants was
married.
Data collection
The FGDs took place between July and September 2020. Due to the
Covid-19 pandemic, they were conducted online using the Zoom plat-
form. Four group discussions were held comprising one mixed FGD with
both women and men, two FGDs with only women and one FGD with
only men. The reason for having mixed- and separate-sex FGDs was to
explore whether different perceptions emerged in the different FGD
types. Initially, we aimed to have six FGDs; however, in our last two
FGDs, we realised that no newer information had resulted from the
discussions and therefore decided to stop recruiting more participants
after the fourth FGD.
The FGDs lasted 1—1.5 h and were audio-recorded with the partici-
pants' consent. They were conducted in the Somali language by two
Somali-speaking researchers, one moderating the discussions and the
other observing the interactions between the participants and their
levels of engagement. Both the moderator and observer also reflected on
the discussions. Their notes during the FGDs and subsequent reflections
were used when analysing the data. FGDs 1 and 2 were moderated by a
woman (last author) and observed by a man (first author), and FGDs 3
and 4 were moderated by two men (first author and third author). The
moderators who conducted the FGDs are experienced in conducting
such discussions and qualitative studies. See

planning. Before use in the FGDs, the vignette was presented to students
in a master's of public health programme in Somalia who provided
feedback on whether it would be culturally accepted by the participants.
The vignette was then tested in the first FGD (mixed sex). As no revision
was made to the vignette or the follow-up questions, the data from the
first FGD were included in the analysis. The FGDs started with the
moderator reading the vignette aloud (see
) and asking the
Table 3
participants to give their perceptions and thoughts about the scenario,
specifically in relation to family planning. The aim of using the vignette
was to give the discussion more depth and focus than it would if based
on the participants' perceptions alone. Structured follow-up questions
were asked to draw out the participants' own perceptions regarding
family planning and what they would have done differently from the
couples in the vignette (see
Table 3)
The interactions during the FGDs were highly positive, and the
participants appeared excited to discuss the case scenario. In all the
FGDs except one (FGD3), the participants discussed the topic so exten-
sively that there was insufficient time to cover all aspects. While the
participants did not always agree, they seemed to respect each other's
ideas. The topics on which the participants disagreed are discussed in
the results section.
Data analysis
All audio-recorded FGDs were transcribed verbatim in Somali and
analysed using inductive thematic analysis
First, the transcripts
[28].
were read inductively several times by the first, second and last authors.
The data were then read critically to capture the ideas and concepts
expressed by the participants. The first and last authors, who coded the
Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare 35 (2023) 100828
data [ANONYMISED], discussed their reflections and the ideas and
concepts that had emerged with the second author [ANONYMISED].
Codes were then extracted from the text segments describing the par-
ticipants' perceptions of the phenomenon and translated into English.
[ANONYMISED] then grouped the codes and text segments into pre-
liminary themes, which were discussed by all the authors. Next, the
themes were revised, and some of the subthemes were merged into
themes. All the themes reflected on the core concept of the participants'
perceptions of family planning and child spacing.
Ethical considerations
The study received ethical approval from the Ministry of Health and
Human Services at the Somali Federal Republic (MOH & HS/DGO/
0605/June/2020). All the participants received oral information about
the nature of the study and were informed that their participation was
voluntary and that they could withdraw their consent at any time
without explanation. All participants gave oral consent to participate
and to be audio-recorded.
Results
The thematic analysis resulted in the following four themes (see
Table 4
): The first, the concept of child spacing is more accepted than family
planning, reflects how participants wanted to define the family planning
concept and the differences in young people and their parents and
grandparents generations' attitudes towards the topic. The second, the
decision of child spacing goes beyond the couple, describes how child
spacing decisions are shared. The third, acceptability and availability of
child-spacing methods, explores the perceptions of the participants and
society regarding what methods to use for child spacing and the quality
of the products available in the country. The fourth, awareness of child-
spacing methods, describes the participants' views on the importance of
increasing awareness in society and knowledge among healthcare pro-
fessionals who advise and treat women. All four themes were salient in
all the FGDs.
The concept of child spacing is more accepted than family planning
Many of the participants reacted to the concept of family planning
during the FGDs. They emphasised that, in Somalia, the concept of child
spacing is used and understood to be in keeping with Islamic beliefs. All
the participants objected to the concept of family planning, which is
understood to limit the number of children one can choose to have, as
the quotes below demonstrate:
I support their idea [from the vignette] of spacing their children. But
limiting children is not what I support because only Allah knows how many
children they will have. It is not something or a decision that comes from
them. (FGD 2 with women, RI).
I don 't agree with saying that I will have a certain number of children
because we are Muslims. But I support spacing the children by at least three

Scenario
This is the story of newly married couple
Farah and Halima, who are in their early
twenties A year ago, they met at university
when senior medical students and nursing
students were undertaking their
community awareness training in refugee
camps outside Mogadishu. They fell in love
and later married. Halima wanted to
discuss with Farah whether they should
wait to have children because she wanted
to finish her degree in nursing. Farah said
that he had a good job now as a doctor and
Halima didn 't have to work because he
could support his family.
After a long discussion, Farah and Halima
agreed that they would have a child now
but then wait for three years before having
their second child so that Halima could go
back to her studies and gain some work
experience.

years because it is an advantage for the child (FGD 1 with both women and
men, R7).
Both religion and culture were reported to influence the participants'
perceptions of family planning. The participants' reasons for not
accepting family planning were related to their Islamic beliefs and how
society viewed family planning. The participants agreed that child
spacing was permitted in Islam but that many people in their social
environment had misconceptions regarding child spacing. According to
the participants, some people still believed that child spacing was not
permitted in Islam.
This issue of spacing children is not something new. Allah already
mentioned it in the Koran. But many people do not have enough knowledge of
the Koran. (FGD 4 with men, R3).
Acceptance of child spacing is related to age and educational
level
The participants agreed that individuals' acceptance of child spacing
was related to their age and educational level. They perceived that
young people of their generation and their parents/grandparents held
different views on the topic, with the young people and more educated,
recognising the benefits of child spacing for both the mother and the
child to a greater extent than their parents/grandparent's generation.
The participants considered that social norms encourage couples to have
more children, and their parents/grandparent's generation follows these
norms rather than listening to facts regarding the benefits of spacing
children. They also expressed that society attributes greater value and
respect to couples with more children, which, in turn, gives the couples
increased status in the family and society.
Somali society prefers and gives status to families who have many chil-
dren. (FGD 4 with men, R4).
Young people in our age group, between 20 and 25 years old, decide to
space their children, but in the older generation, the ones who have only 'a few
children' still have seven kids. (FGD 1 with both women and men, R7).
Decision of child spacing goes beyond the couple
The participants perceived that the decision to space children is
complex as it may involve other family members. Even if the decision
about child spacing is made mainly within the couple, both partners'
families engage in the decision, whether invited to or not. The families,
particularly the mothers, frequently try to persuade the couple not to
space their children.
Your own parents will not even allow you to space children for two years.
Also, your husband's parents won 't allow you either. So, there are many
challenges from your families. They might say, Are you crazy? . .. even if you
both [the couple] agree, they [the family] interfere with your decisions. (FGD
2 with women, R7).
Although many participants emphasised that the couple should
decide for themselves, they knew that this view differed from the social
norm. Women in particular reported experiencing social pressure to
have numerous children and potentially facing consequences for spacing
children. The participants stated that society stigmatises women who
cannot give birth or who have few children. In such cases, the woman's
husband's family might persuade him to marry another woman, even if
he is happy with his wife. The only time the family might accept the
decision to space children is when the mother undergoes a caesarean
section and a medical doctor advises against trying to have another child
too soon. The family will respect the doctor's advice when it concerns
the mother's health.
Society and parents accept [child spacing] when the health of the mother
is at risk, such as a caesarean section and risk to her life. (FGD 1 with both
women and men, R5).
Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare 35 (2023) 100828
Acceptability and availability of child-spacing methods
Using contraceptives to combine career life and family life.
The participants emphasised that the young people in their genera-
tion want to combine careers with family life and, therefore, will often
consider using contraceptives for child spacing. Although many partic-
ipants preferred child spacing, they did not consider it something that
couples would discuss before marriage. The participants agreed that
child spacing would be beneficial for couples' relationships, as well as
the health of the mother and her child.
The whole family benefits if child spacing is used — both the mother's and
child's health. The couple will get time together, and they will have time for
their children. (FGD 3 with women, RI).
Traditional methods are preferred for child spacing
Although all the participants accepted child spacing and knew of its
benefits, they had different opinions on whether modern contraceptive
methods were an option for all people, whether women or men. Both
young men and women in the study supported traditional methods, such
as breastfeeding and withdrawal, which they thought could be much
safer and more socially acceptable than modern methods. However, in
the male FGD, the participants emphasised condoms as a way of spacing
children.
I support the use of condoms because it has several benefits. Not only does
it protect you against getting pregnant, but it also protects you from other
infectious diseases. (FGD 4 with men, R3).
Some participants, especially women, disagreed that breastfeeding
could protect the mother from becoming pregnant again. They observed
that some mothers might not exclusively breastfeed, which could put
them at risk of becoming pregnant.
A mother might not exclusively breastfeed, and then she might get preg-
nant after the 40 days after birth. She gets pregnant, and the child she gave
birth to will not have good health, as well as the one who is on the way. Not
only that, but she will also suffer a lot. The mother is suffering the child she
gave birth to is suffering and the one she is carrying is also suffering; all three
of them are suffering. (FGD 1 with both women and men, R3).
Modern contraceptive methods are unreliable
Some participants viewed the risks of the side effects of modern
contraceptive methods as outweighing their benefits. They also
perceived that the quality of modern contraceptive medicine available
in the country was unreliable, which made people suspicious and fearful
of using it. Some participants, particularly women, noted that people
who want good quality modern contraceptive medicine purchased it
outside the country.
When living in Somalia, it is bestfor us to use the traditional way because
modern contraceptives are not reliable. We don 't know their quality. (FGD 2
with women, RI).
People do not trust the modern contraceptives available in the country.
They purchase them outside the country. (FGD 2 with women, R2).
The participants had different perceptions about the availability of
modern contraceptive methods in Somalia. Some knew that contracep-
tives were available at maternal and child health centres or hospitals,
but only for married women. However, one participant did not know
where to find contraceptives: 'I don't know if one can get them from
hospitals or other places. This is the first time I am hearing about modern
contraceptive methods' (FGD 3 with women, R5).
Awareness of child-spacing methods
The participants highlighted that increasing awareness in society and
among healthcare providers is important. They expressed that society
needed to understand the benefits of child spacing for the family — the
mother, the child and the father. They indicated that raising social
4


G. Dahir et al.
awareness contributes to their desire for child spacing.
Before we talk about the availability of modern contraceptive methods, we
need to talk about the understanding of child spacing in society. This is where
we need to start. (FGD 4 with men, R3).
You know that Somali people have a bad perception regarding child
spacing or family planning. Making them understand its benefits will take
time. (FGD 4 with men, R4).
Another participant emphasised that awareness about child spacing
is growing, but it might take time for society to accept it.
We have almost accepted child spacing. Let's wait on family planning and
limiting children. (FGD 1 with both women and men, R3).
Participants underscored that healthcare professionals have a re-
sponsibility to raise this awareness. However, some participants who
had conducted internships at maternal and child health facilities felt that
healthcare providers did not have enough knowledge to provide
adequate information to mothers and society. They highlighted the
importance of training healthcare providers in the benefits and conse-
quences of family planning.
To raise awareness, we need experts who can do the job in a good and
sensitive way. I would say that we don 't have those yet. The healthcare
professionals are not yet equipped with such knowledge. (FGD 2 with
women, R2).
Discussion
This study revealed perceptions of family planning and contraceptive
use among young men and women living in Somalia. This is the first
study on family planning with most unmarried young men and women
living in post-conflict Somalia. The most compelling finding, in line with
other studies
is how participants related to the concept of
[16,20]
family planning. Consistently, throughout all the FGDs, the participants
objected to the concept of family planning if it was to limit the number of
children. However, they all supported the concept of child spacing.
Another interesting finding is the shift or transition regarding family size
in the Somali community, particularly in relation to how young women
and men in this study discussed the topic. They thought that their
generation with tertiary education was already practising child spacing.
A recent study
that investigated trends in fertility in several
[23]
countries in Sub-Saharan Africa confirmed that educational level is one
factor that decreases fertility rates and increases the use of family
planning. A recent study
conducted in Ghana with university stu-
[29]
dents reported that the majority of their participants had knowledge of
and practised family planning. However, in contrast with the Ghana
study, our participants suggested both withdrawal as a method to avoid
pregnancy and child spacing.
Even though the participants in our study accepted child spacing,
they pointed to the challenges of Somali families interfering with cou-
ples' decisions to practice it. These findings align with those of other
studies
that highlight the role of cultural norms in fertility
preference and family planning. Sociocultural norms influence how so-
ciety views family size preferences
; if the couple's status in
[17-19]
society is measured by family size, this may affect how the young men
and women perceive family planning. The participants in our study
expressed desperation about how to shift perceptions in families and the
community as the decision to space children extends beyond the married
couple. We hypothesise that healthcare providers in Somalia play a
crucial role in promoting awareness of sexual reproductive health in the
community, particularly among young people. At the same time, as our
participants highlighted, healthcare providers need further knowledge
to be able to take responsibility for raising awareness in the community
and among women. Nevertheless, to increase awareness and use of
family planning methods, the concept of 'spacing' should be used
instead of 'family planning'.
The participants in our study also highlighted the importance that
young men and women living in Somalia place on combining careers
with family life and their awareness of how child spacing could support
Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare 35 (2023) 100828
this. However, they further underscored the unreliability and lack of
good quality contraception available in the country. Accepting child
spacing does not necessarily translate to using it unless the modern
contraceptive is available
. While health awareness about family
[29]
planning can be raised, if contraceptive methods remain unavailable, it
will be hard to decrease the fertility rate and achieve the SDGs in So-
malia
. Our findings also confirm the different layers needed to
[10]
achieve all the SDGs and that the importance of women's education,
offering effective family planning interventions and the availability of
modern contraceptive methods are crucial
[10,23].
Strengths and limitations
This study has methodological strengths and limitations that need to
be addressed. The credibility of the studies was ensured by conducting
FGDs with both women and men, along with only women and only men.
This arrangement allowed us to explore whether there were any
different views between the sexes concerning family planning. While
mixed-sex discussions are challenging to carry out in certain studies due
to gender sensitivity, it is still important to examine different opinions.
We also observed different perceptions from men who participated in
the mixed FGDs than from those who participated in the male-only FGD.
Male participants in the mixed FGD tended to agree with the female
participants in the group. In contrast, in the male-only FGD (FGD 4), the
participants had other perceptions regarding family planning. In FGDs 3
and 4, both the moderator and note-taker were male, which may have
resulted in the female participants discussing less openly and largely
avoiding expressing their perceptions. However, they discussed and
reflected on the case scenario. Conducting individual interviews might
have given us in-depth knowledge of each participant's attitudes to-
wards the phenomenon.
Credibility was also assured by conducting the FGDs in the partici-
pants' native language, which ensured that nuances and various
meanings of the language were captured without losing anything in
translation. To ensure credibility and confirmability, all the co-authors
also conversed throughout the data collection, analysis and interpreta-
tion phases.
Braun and Clarke
highlight the importance of researchers
[28]
reporting their reflexivity as researchers use their expertise to analyse
and construct the themes. The research team consisted of two senior
researchers and two junior researchers, all of whom work in the field of
health science. While the research team had an insider perspective, all
being scholars of Somali origin, they also had outsider perspectives as
some of the team members are in the Somali diaspora. For instance,
using the term' family planning' in the vignette was a conscious choice,
which led to discussion on whether the use of the concept of family
planning was acceptable or not for young men and women living in
Mogadishu. The fact that the research team could navigate between
insider and outsider perspectives may contribute to increasing the val-
idity and robustness of the findings.
The main limitation is that all the participants had university-level
tertiary education, so the findings cannot be transferred to all young
people living in Somalia. The participants in our study likely had some
knowledge of family planning as the majority of them study health
science, which may have influenced their answers. However, the authors
aimed to reduce this bias by using a vignette, posing one question at a
time to highlight the full context of the research topic, avoiding leading
questions and verifying unclear responses by asking follow-up questions
Another limitation is that in each FGD, two or three participants
[27].
knew each other, which may have led to participants having similar
perspectives and agreeing with the perceptions of others. However, the
aim of the FGDs was to capture general perceptions of family planning
by young Somalis living in Mogadishu rather than individual
perceptions.

Conclusion
Our findings illustrate that young people with tertiary education in
Somalia support the concept of child spacing rather than family plan-
ning. However, they have shifted their perceptions of having larger
families in comparison to their parents and grandparents' generations,
which, according to the participants in our study, is partly the result of
gaining tertiary education. They also aim to combine career and family
life. Although the participants in our study want to practice child
spacing, social pressure may push them to some extent to continue in the
same family patterns as their parents and grandparents' generation. The
participants also highlighted the availability of good quality modern
contraceptives as challenging for the people living in post-conflict So-
malia. If modern contraceptives are not available, it becomes hard to
practice child spacing or implement any interventions related to family
planning. Our findings suggest that including young people in raising
awareness about and implementing family planning is crucial, as is
giving voice to young people to advocate family planning and start
dialogue within their own communities.

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a human toxicant to which populations may be exposed through consumption
of geogenically contaminated groundwater. A growing body of experimental literature corroborates the
reproductive toxicity of iAs; however, the results of human studies are inconsistent. Therefore, we con-
ducted a comprehensive review of epidemiologic studies focused on drinking water iAs exposure and
birth outcomes to assess the evidence for causality and to make recommendations for future study. We
reviewed 18 English language papers assessing birth weight, gestational age, and birth size. Thirteen of
the studies were conducted among populations with frequent exposure to high-level groundwater iAs
contamination (>10 pg/L) and five studies were conducted in areas without recognized contamination.
Most studies comprised small samples and used cross-sectional designs, often with ecologic exposure
assessment strategies, although several large prospective investigations and studies with individual-level
measurements were also reported. We conclude that: (1) the epidemiologic evidence for an increased
risk of low birth weight (<2500 g) is insufficient, although there exists limited evidence for birth weight
decreases; (2) the evidence for increased preterm delivery is insufficient; and, (3) there exists minimal
evidence for decreased birth size. In further investigation of birth weight and size, we recommend incor-
poration of individual susceptibility measures using appropriate biomarkers, with collection timed to
windows of vulnerability and speciated arsenic analysis, as well as consideration of populations exposed
primarily to drinking water iAs contamination < 10 pg/L. Given the large potential public health impact,
additional, high quality epidemiologic studies are necessary to more definitively assess the risk.
The extensive distribution of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in the
earth's crust leads to local and regional contamination of ground
drinking water supplies and widespread human exposure (
Amini
et al., 2008; Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). Inorganic arsenic
is well-absorbed by the mammalian gastrointestinal tract and
numerous adverse health effects have been described in associa-
tion with long-term exposure to concentrations pg/L (Naujokas
). In so-called 'arsenic endemic' regions, drinking water
et al., 2013
is often contaminated by gg/L iAs and frequently higher

than 50 pg/L iAs, including areas of Bangladesh, West Bengal
India, Taiwan, Northern Chile, and Central and Eastern Europe
(Smedley and Kinniburgh, 2002). However, exposure to drinking
water sources contaminated primarily by pg/L iAs is more
widespread (Amini et al., 2008), and may also pose health risks. The
World Health Organization and other regulatory bodies have set a
maximum contaminant limit (MCL) of 10 pg/L iAs in drinking water
for the protection of human health predicated on reducing cancer
risk (
), yet this limit does not account for non-cancer

endpoints, such as reproductive effects.
Concern is growing with respect to an increased risk for adverse
birth outcomes associated with chronic drinking water iAs expo-
sure, including lower birth weight, earlier delivery and smaller
neonatal size in exposed mothers and their fetuses (
Vahter, 2009).
Previously, we reviewed the epidemiologic evidence for causal
associations between drinking water iAs and pregnancy loss, and
suggested that long-term exposure to iAs pg/L increases the

risk, but with a need for additional investigation into effect at
pg/L iAs (Bloom et al., 2010). Inorganic arsenic crosses the
human placenta, and accumulates in the developing organs and
systems of a fetus, posing an increased risk potential (Concha et al.,
). A recent study reports detectable levels in newborn meco-
1998
nium (
). Experimental and observational evidence
Vail et al., 2012
suggests that iAs accumulates in and disrupts placental function
(Ahmed et al., 2011) and alters cord blood methylation (Pilsner
et al., 2012)
Abnormal placentation is a strong risk factor for preterm deliv-
ery and restricted fetal growth (Murphy et al., 2006). Altered
vasculogenesis leading to dysplastic placental development (He
et al., 2007), modification of epigenetic markers (Tsang et al., 2012)
and in vitro changes in placental levels of reactive oxygen species
(Massrieh et al., 2006) have been reported following iAs treatment.
Increased inflammatory processes were also reported for newborns
exposed in utero via maternal consumption of iAs contaminated
drinking water (Ahmed et al., 2011; Fry et al., 2007); inflamma-
tion is also a predictor of growth restriction and preterm delivery
(Challis et al., 2009). Recently, a study of ultrasound measurements
suggested restricted in utero growth with increased iAs exposure
among male fetuses (Kippler et al., 2012). Studies have also demon-
strated genotoxic (Chou et al., 2012) and anti-estrogenic (Davey
et al., 2007) properties for iAs, as well as modified expression of
genes associated with immune function (Andrew et al., 2008; Wu
et al., 2003
) and developmental processes (Andrew et al., 2008)
Adverse birth outcomes (
), including low birth

weight (LBW; neonatal weight <2500 g at term) and preterm deliv-
ery (PD; live birth before 37 weeks completed gestation) are
associated with a lifelong increased mortality risk (Crump et al.,
). LBW and PD are also associated with an increased risk
2011
for various morbidities including neurodevelopmental disorders
(Mwaniki et al., 2012), cardiovascular diseases and endocrine dis-
orders (
). In 2010, approximately 11.1% of deliveries
Barker, 2004
were preterm worldwide (Blencowe et al., 2012) and approxi-
mately 15% of newborns weighed <2500 g (
). Coupled
UNICEF, 2012
to the widespread distribution of iAs contaminated drinking water,
the high prevalence of LBW and PD makes even a modest increase
in risk a significant global public health concern.
The animal evidence to date is controversial with respect to
adverse birth outcomes and iAs exposure, primarily reporting
associations at maternally toxic doses (Wang et al., 2006
). Exper-
imental studies, using high-dose intraperitoneal (Zirakjavanmard
et al., 2011) or oral iAs treatment during gestation (Tsang et al.,
), described decreased fetal or neonatal body weight or size.
2012
Low-dose iAs administration via drinking water to dams did not
influence birth outcomes in one recent study, yet was associated
with reduced postnatal growth (Kozul-Horvath et al., 2012
). Sub-
stantial inter-species differences in the rates of iAs methylation
and excretion (
) make extrapolation of animal results
Vahter, 1999
to humans tenuous, and underscores the need for epidemiologic
investigation. In fact, humans are likely to be more sensitive to
arsenic toxicity than experimental animals (
). There-
Mead, 2005
fore, our aim was to comprehensively assess the epidemiologic
literature published to date and to characterize the strength of the
evidence for causal associations between drinking water iAs expo-
sure and birth outcomes. We also provide recommendations for
future investigations to address existing data gaps.
Methods
We searched the scholarly literature using SCOPUS, a com-
prehensive abstract and citation database of research literature,
which indexes 20,000 peer-reviewed journals worldwide including
Medline (http : / /www.info.sciverse.com/scopus/).Our initial search
was limited to original human research articles published in the
English language through August 27th, 2013. To identify candi-
date papers we used the keyword combinations: 1. "arsenic" AND
"birth outcomes" (19 papers identified); 2. "arsenic" AND "birth
weight" (38 papers identified); 3. "arsenic" AND "birth size" (12
papers identified); 4. "arsenic" AND "reproductive outcomes" (22
papers identified); and 5. "arsenic" AND "newborn outcomes" (24
papers identified). We manually searched reference lists in selected
papers and also employed reference lists from review papers to
identify one additional publication. Paper titles and abstracts were
reviewed and retained if arsenic exposure via drinking water and
birth weight, gestational age and/or birth size was a study hypoth-
esis. On January 1st, 2014 we updated the search to include two
papers in addition to 16 papers retained from the initial search.
For each study, we abstracted and summarized the location
and population sampled, epidemiologic design, sample size, expo-
sure and outcome assessment strategies, covariates considered and
the magnitude and precision of effect estimates. These character-
istics were used in a qualitative evaluation of each study and to
assess the impact of the reported results. Larger, prospective stud-
ies and those using individual exposure assessment strategies were
afforded greater consideration than smaller, cross-sectional studies
and those using ecologic exposure assessment strategies. Further-
more, the timing and nature of individual exposure assessment
strategies were considered. We expressed study results as preva-
lence proportion ratios (PPR), odds ratios (OR), or average change
per unit increase of exposure (B) and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIS) or P-values, as reported by the authors. If possi-
ble, we used SAS v.9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, NC, USA) to calculate
the PPR and 95% CIs for studies that did not report measures of
effect. The overall strength and consistency of associations and evi-
dence for a temporal relation in which exposure clearly proceeded
outcome were used to assess the evidence for causality and to make
recommendations for future studies (Hill, 1965)
Results and discussion
We evaluated 16 peer-reviewed studies that addressed drinking
water iAs and birth weight (Table 1), nine studies that captured
gestational age (
) and five studies that addressed birth size
Table 2
(Table 3). Many studies captured multiple endpoints and most were
conducted among populations residing in the so-called 'arsenic-
endemic' regions of India, Bangladesh, China, and Taiwan, where
drinking water iAs contamination is high, widespread and well-
known.
Epidemiologic studies in South Asia
India
Approximately 6,000,000 persons residing in the West Bengal
region of the Ganga Plain in eastern India may be at risk for expo-
sure to iAs in ground water at levels of<10-3200 pg/L (Nordstrom,
). Large scale contamination also occurs in other Ganga Plain
2002
India locales, including Bihar (Chakraborti et al., 2003). Yet, only
three published cross-sectional studies assessed the impact on
birth outcomes in India. This work was completed in the context
of large drinking water surveys conducted in the West Bengal and
Bihar regions, where women employed sources contaminated by
<3 pg/L iAs to as much as 1474 pg/L iAs.
In a small study of 16 Bihari women reporting 64 pregnancies,
increased LBW (PPR=8.33, 95% 1.03, 67.14;
) and PD
Table 1
(PPR=3.33. 95% =0.92, 12.11;
Table 2) were associated with the
use of wells contaminated by 463-1025 pg/L iAs (Chakraborti et al.,
2003). In contrast, no associations (PPR=0.79 and 1.05, respec-
tively) were reported in a small follow-up study of 18 Bengali

At the 1st prenatal health care visit investigators collected mater-
nal hair and toenail specimens for total arsenic analysis and also
a residential drinking water sample. Median drinking water iAs
exposure was low (1.29 pg/L), but 25% of mothers were exposed
to 9.03—734 pg/L. A 1 gg/g increase in the level of total mater-
nal hair arsenic was associated with a —193.5 g decrease in birth
weight (95% CI = —369.9, —13.95), adjusted for gestational age at
the 1 st prenatal visit, activity level and maternal weight gain during
pregnancy, and gestational age at delivery (
). Yet, maternal
Table 1
hair arsenic was not correlated to drinking water iAs concen-
tration (r = 0.23, P=O.IO) and no associations were indicated for
drinking water iAs. Modestly elevated adjusted odds ratios were
also reported for total arsenic in maternal hair (OR=2.50, 95%
Cl=O.74, 8.33) and toenails (OR= 1.20, 95% Cl=O.70, 2.08) at the
1st prenatal visit and birth weight <2750 g, although not of statis-
tical significance. Hair and toenails reflect long term exposure but
their validity and reliability have been questioned as biomarkers
of exposure given concerns with respect to contamination from
exogenous sources, such as iAs in bathing water, and contributions
from innocuous organic species in dietary sources, such seafood
(Marchiset-Ferlay et al., 2012). These limitations appeared less rel-
evant to toenails across a spectrum of exposure levels (Karagas
et al., 2000; Mandal et al., 2004; Slotnick et al., 2007). No signif-
icant birth weight associations were detected using a second set
of postnatal specimens. Although prospective and with collection
of both biologic and environmental media, the small sample size
and inconsistent results across exposure metrics undermines the
impact of the positive result.
A much larger prospective study was conducted on 1578
Bangladeshi women with singleton pregnancies and participating
in an ongoing maternal and infant nutrition intervention study
(Rahman et al., 2009). Urine specimens were collected from moth-
ers at eight and 30 weeks gestation. Birth outcomes were assessed
using records stored by local health centers and augmented by
home visits. The median (range) for urine iAs and its metabolites
was 95 pg/L (6-978). Statistical models including a product term
for urine iAs dichotomized at 100 pg/L, and adjusted for mater-
nal BMI and socioeconomic status, indicated several associations
among women exposed to iAs <100 pg/L urine, but not for women
exposed to iAs 2100 pg/L urine. A 1 pg/L increase in averaged urine
iAs values was associated with a —1.68g (95% —0.44,

tically significant. This prospective study involved a large number
of participants with biologic measures averaging exposure across
early and late gestation (to accommodate changes in water source
or dietary exposures) in addition to adjusting for a comprehen-
Sive panel of confounding variables. Effects were observed only for
women with lower iAs exposures raising the possibility of a com-
peting pregnancy loss risk at higher exposures or an enhancing of
birth weight at iAs >100 pg/L by chance only.
Epidemiologic studies in East Asia
China and Taiwan
Up to 600,000 individuals residing in Inner Mongolia, China
and 200,000 residing in Taiwan are at risk for exposure to <1 to
2400 pg/L iAs and 10-1820 pg/L iAs, respectively, in contaminated
drinking water sources (Nordstrom, 2002). Yet, we identified only
one cross-sectional study of birth outcomes in an arsenic endemic
region of Inner Mongolia and one prospective cohort study of birth
outcomes conducted in an arsenic endemic region of Taiwan. Two
additional cross-sectional studies were conducted in China, and one
in Taiwan, in areas without recognized groundwater iAs contami-
nation.
A large cross-sectional investigation conducted in Inner
Mongolia assessed singleton deliveries in 9890 women using
maternal and newborn health records stored by local clinics (Myers
et al., 2010
). This area is known for groundwater iAs contamina-
tion, and the investigators sampled water from wells suspected
of contamination. Term infants born to mothers consuming water
contaminated by >IOO pg/L iAs were 50 g heavier (95% CI = 20, 80)
on average, than those born to mothers consuming water with
pg/L, adjusted for prenatal care (Table 1). No association was
detected for PD (OR= 1.02, 95% Cl =0.72, 1.44;
). Exposure
Table 2
was assigned as the average sub-village well iAs concentration,
which is likely to have misclassified exposure for some women.
An exposure validation substudy conducted among 111 cor-
roborates the likelihood. In fact, the investigators were unable to
link more than half of the women to exposure data as they were
presumed to employ uncontaminated wells. Women without expo-
sure data were more likely to be primigravid and to have received
adequate prenatal care and so a bias may have been introduced.
Again, limiting the birth weight analysis to full term deliveries may
have introduced a collider stratification or over-adjustment bias as
described earlier.
A very large prospective study conducted in northeastern
Taiwan captured more than 18,000 primiparous, singleton deliver-
ies (
Yang et al., 2003). Using registry data, investigators compared
birth weights and gestational age at delivery between 3872 women
residing in areas with 0—3590 pg/L groundwater iAs contamination
and 14,387 women residing in an area free from groundwa-
ter iAs contamination, matched by degree of urbanization. Term
infants delivered to women residing in the exposed area weighed
-29.05 g (95% Cl = -44.55, -13.55, 0.002;
Table 1) less on aver-
age, adjusted for maternal age, newborn sex, marital status and
education. In addition, exposed women had higher odds for PD
(OR-1.10; 95% Cl=o.91, 1.33;
), although the effect was
Table 2
modest and not of statistical significance. Though the sample size
was large, the ecologic exposure assessment (i.e., 'exposed' vs.
'unexposed') is expected to have introduced exposure measure-
ment misclassification error into the study results. Despite what
was likely to be a consequent bias toward the null hypothesis,
the authors identified a small but statistically significant decrease
in birth weight, suggesting that the 'true' underlying effect may
in fact be larger than that reported. Still, regional comparisons
might reflect sociodemographic differences between groups, and
although the authors matched by a village urbanization index and
adjusted their analysis for years of formal education, residual con-
founding remains a possibility.
Two additional cross-sectional studies were conducted in areas
of China without recognized groundwater iAs contamination. In
one, investigators recruited and interviewed 142 women with sin-
gleton pregnancies receiving prenatal care at one of two Shanghai
City hospitals (Xu et al., 2011 ). Total arsenic was measured in mater-
nal blood (mean = 4.13 pg/L, range = 0.63-30.45) and umbilical cord
blood (mean = 3.82 gg/L, range = 0.31-33.54) at the time of deliv-
ery. Among 71 male newborns, a ten-fold increase in the maternal
arsenic level was associated with a —354.41 g decrease in birth
weight (95% CI =
Table 1 ), adjusted for maternal
-677.53, -31.28;
height and gestational age, and also with a —1.51 days decrease
in gestational age (95% CI= —2.50, —0.51 ; Table 2). Yet, no associa-
tions were detected for 71 female newborns. In another study, 125
women were recruited from a primary delivery center in Dalian
City (
Guan et al., 2012). Total arsenic was measured in maternal
blood collected upon admission for delivery (median = 5.30 pg/L,
range = 0-25) and umbilical cord blood collected prior to passage
of the placenta (median = 3.71 pg/L, range = 0-25). Women with
delivery at <32 weeks gestation or <1500g birth weight, birth

715
defects, and multiple gestations or severe illnesses were excluded
(n = 6). A 1 pg/L increase in maternal blood arsenic was associ-
ated with a —20 g decrease in birth weight (95% CI —39.60, —0.40,
Table 1 ), adjusted for maternal BMI and gestational age
P=O.015;
at delivery, a —1.0mm (95% CI —1.59, —O. 41; 13=0.001;

decrease in newborn chest circumference adjusted for maternal
BMI and gestational age at delivery, and with a —1.0mm (95%
CI —1.78, —0.22; 13=0.017) decrease in birth length, adjusted for
maternal BMI, gestational age at delivery and newborn sex. In addi-
tion, a 1 pg/L increase in umbilical cord arsenic was associated with
a —0.6 mm (95% CI —1.19, —0.01; P-0.021) decrease in neonatal
head circumference, adjusted for maternal BMI and gestational age
at delivery.
Though the authors of these cross-sectional studies employed
hospital delivery records and biomarkers of exposure, the use of
total blood arsenic raises concern (Guan et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2011 ).
Total blood arsenic incorporates both iAs as well as the compara-
tively non-toxic organic arsenic species (Akter et al., 2006) to which
humans are exposed when consuming seafood (Le et al., 1994;
Navas-Acien et al., 2011). This approach is likely to misclassify
exposure, in particular for frequent seafood consumers (
Marchiset-
Ferlay et al., 2012), and might introduce positive confounding
by reproductive toxicants also found in seafood (Bushkin-Bedient
and Carpenter, 2010), such as persistent organohalogen pollu-
tants or mercury (Wigle et al., 2008), driving associations away
from the null hypothesis. In contrast, confounding by benefi-
Cial agents in seafood such as n-3 fatty acids (Brantsæter et al.,
) are anticipated to negatively confound associations toward
2012
the null hypothesis. Furthermore, arsenic is cleared from the
blood in a few hours and therefore is not recommended as a
biomarker for exposure, particularly at low levels of exposure
(ATSDR, 2007).
A large prospective cohort study was conducted on 309
women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies and attending
an obstetrics clinic in an area of central Taiwan without groundwa-
ter iAs contamination (Chou et al., 2012). Women were interviewed
to capture reproductive and medical histories, and urine speci-
mens were also collected during the 3rd trimester for analysis
of iAs and its metabolites (Mean = 0.8 gg/g creatinine, 5th %tile,
95th %tile=O.2-3.9). No association was detected for maternal
iAs exposure and LBW (OR= 1.02; 95% CI-0.78, 1.34; P-0.314;
Table 1). Odds were increased for head circumference <340 mm
(OR-6.16, 95% Cl 0.17, 10.84, 13=0.318;
Table 3) and chest cir-
cumference <320mm (OR-11.69, 95% Cl=o.51, 12.51, P-0.123;
), although confidence intervals were wide. In contrast,
Table 3
the odds were reduced for birth length <450mm (OR=O.13, 95%
), again with a wide confidence
CI=O.OI, 8.13, 13=0.318;
Table 3
interval. The authors adjusted for maternal age, cigarette smok-
ing, alcohol consumption and newborn sex. Although the sample
size was substantial, 28% of the participants were lost to follow-
up, which may or may not have biased study results contingent
on the iAs-birth outcomes association in that group; data were
not available to compare characteristics for the two. Furthermore,
spot urine samples collected in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy
may not represent the biologically effective dose at 'critical win-
dows' of vulnerability (Buck Louis et al., 2006), as iAs has a half-life
of approximately 10 h (ATSDR, 2007) and metabolic efficiency
appears to improve during pregnancy (Concha et al., 1998; Gardner
et al., 2011 ). Such 'mistimed' specimen collection is expected to bias
study results toward the null hypothesis.
Japan
An additional prospective cohort study was conducted in Tokyo,
Japan, a non-arsenic endemic area (Shirai et al., 2010). The authors
recruited 78 pregnant women receiving prenatal care in gestational
weeks 9—40, from a single hospital, and determined total arsenic in
spot urine specimens. The geometric mean was 76.9 gg/g creati-
nine (range = 9.81—1603). The authors did not specify the effects
of arsenic exposure, but reported that there were no associations
with birth weight (
), head circumference or birth length
Table 1
(Table 3), adjusted for maternal age and BMI, cigarette smoking
and gestational age at delivery. Though prospective in nature and
with person-level exposure assessment as well as adjustment for
confounding variables, this small study was likely underpowered to
detect associations given the low levels of exposure. Furthermore,
the use of a total arsenic biomarker in a population of frequent
seafood consumers coupled to the timing of urine collection for
some participants predisposed the results to the aforementioned
biases and confounding by additional related reproductive toxi-
cants.
Epidemiologic studies in South America and Europe
Chile
Prior to the implementation of drinking water iAs mitigation
technologies in the 1970s, approximately 400,000 individuals were
exposed to 10-1000 pg/L IAS in Chile (Nordstrom, 2002), although
the population currently at risk is difficult to ascertain (Bundschuh
). We identified one prospective cohort study conducted
et al., 2012
in an arsenic endemic region of northern Chile.
Employing the public health care system in Chile, 844 pregnant
women were recruited to a prospective study during prenatal
care visits at 16—35 weeks gestation (Hopenhayn et al., 2003)
Women had resided for a minimum of 12 months in the city of
Antofagasta, which was supplied by water sources contaminated by
32.9—52.7 gg/L iAs, or in the city of Valparaiso, which was supplied
by comparatively uncontaminated water sources (0.5-1.1 pg/L
iAs). The average urine total iAs concentration was approximately
10-fold higher among women residing in Antofagasta (54.3 pg/L)
than in Valparaiso (5.3 gg/L). A non-significant —26 g (95% CI = —85,
31) decrease in newborn birth weight was reported per 1 pg/L
increase in maternal urine iAs (Table 1 ). Compared by city of resi-
dence, average birth weights were —57 g (95% CI=—123, 9) lower
for Antofagasta neonates compared to Valparaiso neonates, and
—107 g (95% —265, 50) lower when restricted to infants with
<38 weeks completed gestation at delivery, although not of statisti-
cal significance. The authors adjusted for maternal age, BMI, height
and parity, cigarette smoking, gestational age at delivery, cigarette
smoking, household income, prenatal care and newborn sex. The
ecologic exposure assignment strategy suggested a decreased birth
weight in association with higher maternal drinking water iAs,
but the results were not statistically significant and the individual
exposure assessment approach indicated no association; however,
the direction of the effect estimates was consistent. Collection of
biospecimens later in pregnancy was likely to have introduced
exposure measurement misclassification into the study results,
with an ensuing bias toward the null hypothesis, and thus might
account for the non-significant birth weight decrease. However,
the sample size was large, outcomes were abstracted from clinical
records, and confounding variables were considered.
Romania and Spain
Approximately 400,000 people are exposed to as much as
167 gg/L iAs in Hungary and western Romania, and more than
50,000 Spaniards are likely exposed to up to 100 pg/L iAs
(Nordstrom, 2002). We identified one cross-sectional study con-
ducted in an arsenic endemic region of western Romania. While
we found one study conducted on the Spanish Tenerife Island, this
area is not known for groundwater iAs contamination.
A recent cross-sectional study described 38 women residing
in Arad County, Romania with uncomplicated, full-term single-
ton deliveries in the 10 previous years, and having resided in the


716
M.S. Bloom et al. / International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health 217 (2014) 709-719
same locale for at least 18 years (Gelmann et al., 2013
Women
were recruited from four villages with known drinking ground-
water iAs contamination (>IO pg/L) and four villages accessing
uncontaminated water sources (<1 pg/L). Data were captured by
personal interview and drinking water, urine and toenail specimens
were collected. Although no association was reported for drinking
water iAs and birth weight (Table 1), women with a LBW delivery
were significantly (13=0.019) more likely to have had the sum of
urine iAs and its metabolites >9 pg/L (67%) compared to women
with a normal birth weight delivery (10%). Ratios of iAs metabo-
lites in urine, methylarsonate (MMA) and dimethylarsinate (DMA)
were used to identify women with higher and lower rates of iAs
metabolism (Vahter and Concha, 2001 ). Yet, these were not associ-
ated with birth weight nor were toenail iAs. The results suggested
that mothers with a history of LBW were less likely to partition iAs
internally than mothers without LBW and that factors in addition to
metabolism may designate women to higher risk for adverse birth
outcomes in association with iAs exposure (Gelmann et al., 2013).
However, the small sample size was unlikely to be sufficiently pow-
ered to detect subtle differences in drinking water iAs, in particular
at the low levels measured in this study. The comparisons were
not adjusted for confounding variables, although bivariate anal-
ysis suggested that the groups were mostly similar in terms of
sociodemographic factors and health-related behaviors. Still, the
cross-sectional nature of this study precludes temporality, coupled
to the short half-life of iAs which as noted earlier introduces poten-
tial exposure measurement misclassification error, especially for
older deliveries.
Another recent cross-sectional study conducted in Tenerife,
Spain described 96 women and their newborns, with mater-
nal completion of a structured questionnaire and collection of
meconium from newborn diapers with total arsenic analysis (
Vail
et al., 2012
). Arsenic was detected in 37 meconium specimens
(0.10-31.40 ng/g), presumably representing cumulative exposure
starting in the 12th week of gestation. Babies (n = 76) with
detectable arsenic were 223.8g heavier on average than those
without (P = 0.043;
Table 1), although gestational ages (n = 72)
were similar (13=0.813;
). Yet, meconium arsenic concen-
Table 2
tration was unrelated to reported maternal drinking water source
(P = 0.582). As noted above, for populations with low drinking water
iAs exposure and high rates of seafood consumption total arsenic
most likely reflects dietary exposure to the innocuous organic
arsenic species. Furthermore, the latter likely results in confound-
ing by additional, unmeasured agents found in seafood that may
have positively or negatively confounded the associations.
Synthesis
Whereas the evidence from animal and in vitro studies provides
sufficient biologic plausibility for iAs as a reproductive toxicant,
the evidence from the epidemiologic literature is inconsistent.
We noted wide variation in the quality and rigor of the stud-
ies reviewed, particularly in terms of sample size, study design,
exposure assessment strategies and adjustment for confounding.
Furthermore, differences exist in populations studied in terms of
residence in IAS or non-iAs endemic regions, and thus the extent of
exposure through consumption of contaminated drinking water.
Exposure to iAs decreased birth weight in some studies
(Chakraborti et al., 2003; Guan et al., 2012; Huyck et al., 2007; Xu
et al., 2011 ), including in two large, high quality prospective inves-
tigations (Rahman et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2003). A decrease was
suggested, although not detected in another large and high-quality
prospective study (Hopenhayn et al., 2003). In contrast, no effect
or an increase in birth weight was reported in several other studies
(Ahamed et al., 2006; Chakraborti et al., 2004; Chou et al., 2012;
Gelmann et al., 2013; Mukherjee et al., 2005; Shirai et al., 2010;
Vail et al., 2012
) including two large cross-sectional studies of high
quality (
Kwok et al., 2006; Myers et al., 2010). Based on our review
of the literature, we conclude that insufficient epidemiologic evi-
dence exists to corroborate an increase in LBW as a clinical outcome.
However, there exists limited evidence for a continuous decrease
in birth weight across the distribution, but also some evidence for
an increase with iAs.
Very few studies detected associations between gestational
age and drinking water iAs, with only two reports of significant
decreases reported from cross-sectional investigations (Ahmad
et al., 2001; xu et al., 2011
). In contrast, two very large studies
conducted in arsenic endemic areas, one cross-sectional (Myers
et al., 2010
) and one prospective (Yang et al., 2003), reported no
association for drinking water iAs and gestational age, in popula-
tions with exposure to drinking water sources contaminated by
well over 50 pg/L iAs. Based on our review of the epidemiologic
evidence published to date, we conclude that insufficient evidence
exists for a causal association between drinking water iAs exposure
and gestational age. However, as the number of studies capturing
gestational age was limited, a potential association cannot be ruled
out.
Few investigations incorporated measures of birth size as
study endpoints. A large, well-conducted prospective cohort study
reported significantly decreased head and chest circumference,
with a 'borderline' significant decrease in birth length among
infants delivered to mothers residing in an iAs endemic region
of Bangladesh (Rahman et al., 2009), and significant decreases
for head circumference, chest circumference and birth length
were reported from a small cross-sectional study conducted in a
non-iAs-endemic region of China (Guan et al., 2012). Three addi-
tional studies did not report significant cross-sectional associations
among populations residing in non-iAs-endemic regions. However,
the effect estimates for one study were quite strong, although
imprecise (Chou et al., 2012), no effect estimates were reported
for another (Shirai et al., 2010) and exposure assessment issues
limit the interpretability of the results from the third (Vall et al.,
). Therefore we suggest there that minimal evidence exists for
2012
a causal association between maternal drinking water iAs exposure
and reduced birth size.
Recommendations
Several salient methodologic issues limit the studies we
reviewed herein, and might account, at least in part for the inconsis-
tency ofthe reported results, or likewise have biased results toward
the null hypothesis and obscured associations. However, investi-
gations of populations exposed to high levels of drinking water
iAs were often conducted in underdeveloped regions, introduc-
ing practical and financial limitations into study designs. Still, it
seems constructive to discuss issues for consideration in future
study design, to more conclusively assess risks. In addition to the
methodologic limitations raised earlier, variable susceptibility to
iAs toxicity, dietary sources of iAs exposure and paternal effects
may also be important. Consideration of these issues will require
attention to further clarify the impact of drinking water iAs expo-
sure in future investigation of birth weight and birth size.
Vulnerability to the toxic effects of iAs varies substantially
between pregnant women, independent of gestational length (Li
et al., 2008
), and overlooking this issue may overshadow or oth-
erwise bias associations between maternal iAs exposure and birth
outcomes. Several factors including polymorphisms in the AS3MT
and MTHFR genes (Lindberg et al., 2007) and nutritional status
for folate, glutathione and methionine (Vahter, 2002) impact the
metabolism of iAs. Adjustment for maternal BMI or height can

The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System-Zika Postpartum Emergency Response study,
implemented in Puerto Rico during the Zika virus outbreak (2016-2017) and after Hurricanes Irma and
Maria (2017-2018), collected pregnancy-related data using postpartum hospital-based surveys and
telephone follow-up surveys. Response rates of 75% or more were observed across five study surveys.
The study informed programs, increased the Puerto Rico Department of Health's capacity to conduct
maternal-infant health surveillance, and demonstrated the effectiveness of this methodology for
collecting data during public health emergencies. (Am] Public Health. 2022; 1 12(4):574-578. https://

n 201 6, the Puerto Rico Department
of Health (PRDH) and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention imple-
mented the Pregnancy Risk Assessment
Monitoring System-Zika Postpartum
Emergency Response (PRAMS-ZPER)
study to address the urgent need for
data on Zika virus infection ("Zika")
INTERVENTION
The study initially assessed Zika-related
experiences and behaviors during
pregnancy and later expanded to
examine paternal involvement during
pregnancy and the impact of Hurri-
canes Irma and Maria on access to
maternal and infant health services. We
describe the study methodology, which
may be leveraged to rapidly respond to
public health emergencies that affect
maternal-infant health.
PLACE AND TIME
The PRAMS-ZPER study was imple-
mented in Puerto Rico during the Zika
outbreak (2016-2017) and after Hurri-
canes Irma and Marfa (2017-2018). The
two-phase study included hospital-based
surveys conducted after delivery and
telephone follow-up surveys conducted
three to nine months postpartum. Phase
1 was fielded from August 2016 to June
201 7, and phase 2 from November 2017
to April 2018. Phase 2 repeated the
phase 1 maternal surveys (hospital-
based and telephone follow-up) and
added an in-hospital paternal survey and
educational component (Tables 1 and 2).
PERSON
For both phases, women who had a
live-born infant in selected hospitals
and met eligibility criteria could partici-
pate. For phase 2, the paternal survey
could be completed by the father of the
sampled woman's live-born infant or by
the woman's partner (including same-
sex partners). El'gibility for the infants'
fathers (or mothers' partners) was
based on the mother being sampled,
not on her participation in the survey.
After completing the in-hospital sur-
vey in phase 2, sampled mothers and
infants' fathers (or mothers' partners)
were offered the educational compo-
nent. Interested family members (e.g ,
grandparents) were allowed to listen to
the educational component if allowed
by the participants

almplementation of the phase 2 in-hospital survey was planned to begin in September 2017. Project implementation was delayed and shortened to 43
days in phase 2 (compared with 98 days in phase 1) because of the loss of infrastructure in the aftermath of Hurricanes Irma (September 7, 201 7) and
Maria (September 20, 2017).
bThe PRAMS-ZPER paternal/partner survey could be completed by the infant's biological father, the mother's same-sex partner, or men who were not
the infant's biological father but were identified by the sampled mother as their current partner at the time of the in-hospital survey.

the active transmission of Zika in
Puerto Rico. Between 2016 and 2017,
nearly 4000 pregnant women were
reported to have Zika, I which can
cause microcephaly and other birth
defects in infants born to women
infected during pregnancy.2 Thus, there
was an urgent need to gather
information on Zika-related experien-
ces and behaviors during pregnancy.
Although PRDH declared the end of the
Zika outbreak in June 201 Zika sur-
veillance continued, administrative
orders remained in place for continued
testing of pregnant women, 4 and use of
protective measures were still
recommended during pregnancy.
Phase 2 allowed continued assessment
of maternal behaviors and added the

a The telephone follow-up surveys gathered supplemental data to address emerging data needs identified as the Zika outbreak progressed. The phase 1
telephone follow-up survey was implemented approximately 9 months after birth because of time needed to identify gaps, develop surveys and
protocols, and obtain necessary approvals. Streamlining of methods during phase 2 allowed for implementation of the telephone follow-up survey
approximately 3 months after birth.
maternal and infant postpartum health
and behaviors that could not be
assessed at the time of delivery.
The landfall of Hurricanes Irma and
Marfa posed new chal enges to pregnant
and postpartum women. The PRAMS-
ZPER study was in a unique position to
collect data about experiences in the
aftermath of the disaster and was lever-
aged for that purpose by including
hurricane-related questions. The
in-hosp'tal data collection also allowed
PRDH to incorporate an educational
component to reinforce public health
messaging for postpartum women and
families
IMPLEMENTATION
Data from Puerto Rico's Demographic
Registry were used to identify hospitals.
Sampling hospitals were selected
based on the number of births during
the previous year. Hospitals with 100 or
more births in 2015 were eligible for
participation during phase 1, and hos-
pitals with 100 or more births in 2016
were eligible for participation during
phase 2. PRDH contacted selected
hospitals to complete the study's
participation agreement. In phase 1,
all 36 eligible hospitals participated,
representing 99.8% of live births on
the island during the sampling period.
In phase 2, 30 of 34 eligible hospitals
participated, representing 94.2% of
births. For this phase, one hospital
declined participation, and three hospi-
tals were not included because their
maternity wards were closed after Hur-
ricane Marfa
For phase 1, the sampling design was
stratified by the island's eight health
regions. Regional oversampling was not
performed for phase 2 because of the
shortened data collection timeframe
after the hurricanes (Table 1). For both
phases, probability sampling was used
to identify the sampling days in each
hospital. All eligible women with a live
birth on sampled days were invited to
participate.
For phase 1, study personnel
approached women 24 or 36 hours
after vaginal or cesarean section deliv-
ery, respectively. Approximately 220
women were identified to have been
discharged before they could be invited
to participate. For phase 2, women
were approached soon after delivery
because of the likelihood of early dis-
charge (e.g., < 24 hours) after the hurri-
cane. For phase 2, we were unable to
assess the number of women who
were discharged before being con-
tacted by study personnel. In-hospital
surveys were self-administered on
paper or electronic tablets, with most
(72.0%) completed on tablets during

phase 1. For phase 2, most (84 0%)
surveys were completed on paper
because of delays in tablet availability.
For the paternal survey, fathers were
approached soon after the birth and
before maternal discharge. For all sur-
veys, respondents received a small gift
for their participation (Table 1 and 2).
Respondents' characteristics are shown
in Table A (available as a supp ement to
the online version of this article at
http://www.ajph.org).
After completing the in-hospital sur-
vey in phase 2, participants were
offered the educational component,
which included a 30-minute interactive
flip-chart presentation addressing post-
partum health, newborn care, and Zika
prevention. Supplemental educational
materials on breastfeeding, infant care,
postpartum care, and mental health,
and CDC's Developmental Milestones
booklet were integrated into the pre-
sentation. A notepad and pen were
provided to participants to write down
any questions that the study staff were
unable to answer, for later follow-up
with hospital staff.
After completing the in-hospital data
collection, PRDH performed a determin-
iStic linkage of samp ed mothers to birth
certificate records. Among respondents,
linkage rates were 99.4% and 99.5% for
phase 1 and 2, respectively. Linkage to
birth certificate data provided contact
information for telephone follow-up
and allowed inclusion of select birth
certificate variables (Table B, available
as a supplement to the online version
of this article at http://www.ajph.org) in
analytic data sets. Birth certificate data
were also used for data weighting. Data
were weighted for stratified sampling
design and to adjust for differential
nonresponse. The standard PRAMS
protocol proceduress were followed for
the telephone follow-up surveys.
EVALUATION
Maternal response rates were 80.6%
and 94.4% for the in-hospital surveys
(Table l) and 76.6% and 82.8% for
the telephone follow-up surveys for
phase 1 and 2, respectively (Table 2).
A response rate of 74.6% was obtained
for the paternal survey (Table 1).
Dissemination efforts included a con-
ference for health care professionals,
data analysis training, and development
of fact sheets and journal articles. Pub-
lished findings have highlighted topics
ranging from the use of Zika prevention
measures during pregnancy 8 to
assessing men's health and involvement
during pregnancy? Findings have
informed PRDH activities, such as home-
visiting and nurse-visiting programs. In
addition, data have guided the develop-
ment of educational and hea th promo-
tion materials (e.g., provider's role in
Zika prevention, maternal use of
protective measures, and hurricane
10,11
preparedness).
PRAMS-ZPER study data will continue
to be used to assess the effectiveness
and reach of Zika emergency response
activities, including implementation of
clinical testing guidelines, 4 efforts to
increase contraceptive use, and receipt
of Zika-related screenings for infants.
ADVERSE EFFECTS
We have no adverse effects to report.
SUSTAINABILITY
Implementing the PRAMS-ZPER study
during two types of public health emer-
gencies (infectious disease outbreak and
natural disaster) was labor-intensive and
logistically challenging because of evolv-
ing data needs and operational limita-
tions. During phase 2, it was necessary
OPINIONS, IDEAS, & PRACTICE
to rapidly adapt questionnaires, proto-
cols, and implementation guidelines
after the hurricanes. However, phase 2
response rates exceeded the already
h'gh rates obtained in phase 1 by
decreasing the length of the data collec-
tion period, removing wait-time require-
ments for contacting mothers, providing
extensive interviewer training, imple-
menting a feasibility pilot study, including
staff in project planning, and maintaining
strong col aboration with partners (e.g.,
hospitals, Demographic Registry), and
PRDH staff resilience
PUBLIC HEALTH
SIGNIFICANCE
Pregnant women and infants are at
increased risk for adverse health out-
comes during public health emergen-
Cies because of their unique health
care and resource needs.12 Given the
impact of recent public health emer-
gencies (e.g., Zika, natural disasters,
COVID-1 9) on maternal and infant
health and receipt of health services,
establishment of new data collection
mechanisms or modification of existing
surveillance systems for health assess-
ments must be done rapidly. PRAMS-
ZPER study operations can be adopted
by other state, local, or territorial public
health departments as part of emer-
gency preparedness planning. PRAMS-
ZPER study protocols, questionnaires,
data request guidance, and materials
are publicly avai able on the PRAMS
Web sitell and may be adapted for sur-
veillance studies examining maternal
and infant health. Alpu

Given the increasing involvement of families in child protection processes pre-birth and during infancy, it is imperative that we have greater evidence of child
protection processes during this period. A court file review was used to determine the characteristics and issues for families who are going through care proceedings
for their infants, the outcomes of court proceedings and the safety plans required for families. Of the 39 court files analysed 36 % of the families were reported to
child protection prenatally and 64 % were reported postnatally. One in five infants were removed into care directly from the maternity ward with the average age of
removal being 4.9 months. The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence (51 %), drug and alcohol use (49 %) and mental health issues (41 %). The
majority of these cases resulted in final orders with a large proportion having until 18 protection orders (41 %), and 23 % having orders revoked or withdrawn
allowing the infant to be reunified to the family. The complexity of issues of the cases in these care proceedings highlights the need for greater sophistication in
strategies to support these families who cross multiple service systems to enable reunification of families and prevention of removals.
1. Introduction
Infant removals into out-of-home care by the child protection system
are a highly emotive and complex issue. In Australia, infants are the age
group with the highest rates of child maltreatment substantiation and
entry into out-of-home care (Australian Institute for Health and Welfare,
). Internationally, increases in infant child protection involvement
2022
have been seen in England, New Zealand, and the United States (
Pearson
et al., 2020
). In Australia, the over-representation of Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander (hereafter respectfully called Aboriginal) infants is
a cause of great community concern and the over-representation of
Aboriginal children involved in child protection is a priority target for
reduction by the Australian Government in the National Agreement on
Closing the Gap (Commonwealth of Australia, 2020). Given the high
level of child protection involvement during the perinatal period, this
requires a special focus for policy and practice to enable improved
outcomes for families and infants.
Internationally there is great variability regarding the legal status of
a fetus and the statutory powers of child welfare/protection systems of
pregnant mothers. Some countries and jurisdictions within countries
(including United States and England) have powers to place birth alerts
on unborn babies or to notify pregnant mothers to child welfare services

where there are safety concerns(Bureau of Justice Assistance, 2023;
Ward et al., 2022
). In Australia, a number of states such as Western
Australia (WA), New South Wales and Queensland have legislation
which gives child protection systems the statutory power to receive and
investigate child protection notifications of pregnant mothers (Depart-
ment of Communities, 2021; New South Wales Government, 2013) In
WA, pregnant mothers can be notified to the "Department" (of Com-
munities- Child Protection and Family Support) when an unborn child is
identified as at risk of abuse and/or neglect. Following investigation,
these notifications may be substantiated and pre-birth planning may
commence to address safety concerns with the family of the unborn child
which will usually involve parents, their family and safety networks, the
Department of Communities, WA Health and, in some cases, the parent' s
legal representatives'. In terms of time frames, it is recommended that
these meetings are held in the 20th, 26th and 32nd week of gestation.
The aims of pre-birth planning meetings include developing action plans
during pregnancy and following birth, including preparation for the
infant (e.g. securing safe accommodation); evidence of behavioural
change to address concerns raised by the Department; developing and
enacting a personal safety plan relating to family and domestic violence;
and developing a safety network of people (Department of Communities,
2021)

M. O'Donnell et al.
In WA, during 2020—21, there were 669 unborn children receiving
child protection services and 1025 infants (
Australian Institute for
). Notifications that were substantiated
Health and Welfare, 2022
involved 213 unborn children and 370 infants, with 191 infants
admitted into out-of-home care. Child protection case workers have the
statutory authority to decide whether there is an immediate and sub-
stantial risk of harm to a child's well-being and to take the child into
provisional protection and care. This requires the child protection
department to apply to the court for a protection order.
Following an application to the Children's Court by the Department,
due to an infant being considered at substantial risk of harm, the court
can decide that the child is not in need of protection or it can make one
of four potential orders: a protection order (supervision) where the child
stays with the family but is supervised by the Department; a protection
order (time-limited) where the child is placed in the care of the
Department for up to two years; a protection order (until 18) where the
child is placed in care until they are 18 years old; or a protection order
(Special Guardianship Order) where the child is placed with a carer
other than the Department until they are 18 years old (Department of the
Attorney General, 2006). The Department submits evidence to the court
to support the protection and care application which typically includes
the requirements of parents to address safety plans.
There is currently no research literature on the requirements of
families pre/post-birth to meet safety requirements of the Department or
the outcomes of these care proceedings. The literature that is available
around infants in care proceedings is from England which found that
infants aged less than 1 year constituted 27 % of all children in care
proceedings with the largest proportion of infants being newborn (<4
weeks old). Almost half of all newborns recorded the final legal order
outcome as "placed for adoption", with 21 % placed with extended
family and 13—15 % placed with parents on supervision orders (
Broad-
hurst et al., 2018). In New Zealand, a rise in infant removal legal orders
was reported until 2018 with a reduction in orders from 2019 to 2020
following the Hawkes Bay case (
Keddell et al., 2022
). This sentinel event
in 2019 drew media and community attention to the ethical and pro-
cedural issues of the use of S78 interim orders (a without notice removal
order) involving Mäori babies. This resulted in several enquiries
including a review of the use of S78 interim orders which subsequently
led to a reduction in removals.
Given the increasing involvement of families in child protection
processes pre-birth and during infancy, it is imperative that we have a
greater understanding of child protection and court outcomes for fam-
ilies subjected to care proceedings; as well as the requirements placed on
families for orders to be revoked and potential reunification. Therefore,
this study aims to determine the characteristics and issues for families
who are going through care proceedings for their infants, the outcomes
of court proceedings and the safety plans required for families by using a
court file review.
2. Method
This study is a court file review conducted in 2020/2021 of cases
from a random sample of WA Children's Court case files for families
experiencing a child protection removal of their child into out-of-home
care within the child's first year of life. The study sample criteria
included cases where an infant had court proceedings and was placed
into out-of-home care within 365 days from birth in WA Court files from
the year 2014—15 was chosen from which to select cases so that we could
follow-up proceedings to the latest finalised court proceeding as of
2020/21. In WA there were 203 infants (aged < 1 year) admitted to care
and protection orders in 2014/15, with approximately half the cases
being Aboriginal(Australian Insitute of Health and Welfare, 2016) The
final sample for which data was extracted were 39 infant cases which is
19 % of cases. Mixed methods analysis was used to conduct a quanti-
tative analysis of the court file data and a qualitative analysis of safety
plan requirements within the court files.

2.1. Variables and pro formafor data collection
Data was accessed and extracted from the case files using a proforma
designed for the study and entered into SPSS. The pro-forma was
developed from similar studies and policy documents, then revised
through consultation with Court staff and pilot data collection from the
Court files. Variables were chosen to describe the characteristics of the
cases, services utilised and factors associated with child protection
involvement. Information on both parents and infants were extracted,
and relevant information regarding placements and court outcomes.

Demographics: Characteristics of both parents, including de-
mographic factors such as age and ethnicity (Aboriginality or non-
Australian).
Parents Own Abuse History: Parents' own child protection history was
collected where possible.
Mental Health: The recorded mental health status of parents was
collected from the proceedings and/or supporting information filed by
parents or child protection services. Parents mental health status was
collected as an indicator of mental health issues whether it was an
official diagnosis, self-reported by the parents, or documented by
caseworkers.
Criminal involvement: Parents' current and historical criminal
involvement was included where it was noted on the file that they were
incarcerated and/or on parole during child protection proceedings.
Pre and post-natal notifications to child protection services: Information
on the prenatal and postnatal notifications to child protection services
and the areas of safety concerns were recorded based on available
information.
Services: Services parents were referred to or involved with to
ascertain support parents were provided in relation to child protection
concerns.
2.3. Infant characteristics
Demographics: The infant's age at removal, their sex, Indigenous
status, and number of siblings. The infant's age at removal was ascer-
tained by calculating the difference between the infant's date of birth
and the date they were assumed into care or removed.
2.4. Safety plans
In WA, safety plans are developed with families where there are
substantiated child protection concerns. The court files contained in-
formation on the safety plan requirements for families.
2.5. Data analysis
The quantitative data was analysed using SPSS with descriptive
statistics reported. The qualitative information on safety plan re-
quirements was recorded in the proforma and entered into NVIVO. The
safety plan requirements were coded and thematically analysed using
NVIVO (Braun and Clarke, 2006). Two researchers coded the data to
identify areas of concern and requirements for parents in the safety plan.
Inter-rater reliability was determined by cross-checking identified codes
and themes across the safety plan requirements for the 39 cases.
2.6. Ethics
Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Western
Australia Human Research Ethics Committee (2019/RA/4/20/5080).
Approvals to access court files and extract information on site were
provided to researchers by the President of the WA Children's Court and
the Justice Research Application and Advisory Committee.

3. Results
Of the 39 court files analysed there were more male than female
infants with similar proportions of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal in-
fants (see
Tablel
). Infants were removed into care from less than a week
to up to 12 months, but on average at 4.9 months. The majority of in-
fants had siblings (77 %) with a large proportion having an elder sibling
in care (51 %). On average families had 1.9 children removed.
Of the 39 cases, 36 % of the families were reported to child protec-
tion prenatally and 64 % reported postnatally (
). There was vari-
Fig. 1
ation in the outcomes of the final orders with 41 % having an until 18
protection order, 23 % reunified with family and 21 % placed on a
special guardianship order.
Of those cases with a prenatal report, 35 % were placed on protection
orders until 18, 21 % on protection orders (1—2 years), 21 % on special
guardianship orders, 14 % the order was revoked, and 1 infant was
placed on a supervision order with a parent.
The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence (51
%), drug and alcohol use (49 %) and mental health issues (41 %)
). Half of the infants were placed in foster care and the other half
(Table 2
in kinship care placements. The Department had legal representation in
100 % of cases with 59 % of mothers having legal representation in final
orders and fathers a lesser extent at 54 %. Only a small proportion of
cases had a parental affidavit on file.
3.1. Safety/Reunification planning
For mothers who are pregnant or parents who have an infant where
there are concerns about safety and wellbeing, the Department will meet
with parents to develop a safety plan. According to the Department of
Communities (Departments') Child Protection Practice Manual 'safety
planning is a proactive, structured and monitored process that provides
parents with an opportunity to demonstrate that they can address the
Departments' concerns by providing safety for their child' (Department
of Communities, 2019). It is a process which takes place between a child
protection case worker, parents, may contain people within the safety
network and, if appropriate, the child. The process usually involves a
written plan to address the Department's concerns of harm or potential
harm during pregnancy, or for a child through the development of safety
goals.
In the court case files, the majority of the cases had safety plans on
court files (90 %). The requirements for parents were coded into the-
matic areas. Requirements were fairly consistent across the files
regarding concerns that were required to be addressed which are out-
lined below (Table 3).
3.2. Actively engage with Departrnent
A large proportion of cases (49 %) had a requirement that parents
would actively engage with the Department and was stipulated explic-
itly in parents' safety plans:
'Engaging with Department: Task: respond to all calls, home visits,
letters and text messages and attend all meetings. Inform case
manager ASAP if contact details change or there are difficulties
attending a scheduled appointment. Goal: To be actively engaged
with the Department, attend all meetings; attend all arranged con-
tacts with infant to work towards reunification." (Case 17)
"Continue to engage appropriately with the Department. For
example, be respectful, attend meetings, advise if they cannot attend
meetings and contact. Continue positive contact. If contact does not
occur at no fault of the parents, there will be a make-up contact."
(Case 39)
To ensure engagement with the Department there were a small
number of safety plans that stipulated specifically mobile phones. Two
plans required the parents to:

'Maintain a mobile service with text and voicemail facility" (Case
36) and "mother and father to have mobile phone on at all times to
take phone calls from case manager and other services." (Case 23).
In two cases the Department stipulated that they would assist parents
with purchasing mobile phones.
3.3. Legal representation
In a small number of cases (8 %) legal representation and court
proceedings were mentioned in requirements with some cases stipu-
lating explicit support from the Department for a parent in family court
proceedings:
"Father to arrange lawyer for Children's Court; father to attend
court." (Case 7)
"Father's lawyer to seek grant of aid for Father to have infant remain
in his care. Department (of Child Protection and Family Support) will
write a letter in support of Father being able to institute proceedings
in the Family Court." (Case 20)
3.4. Support and safety network
A number of families (18 %) were required to demonstrate a safety
network with specific individuals having responsibilities in their safety
plans:
'Demonstrate a support network and a safety plan with all parties."
(Case 33)
'Mother and/or father to contact family if in need of support. If fa-
ther is aware that mother is struggling with the children and needs a
break he will organise a safe person to look after the children to give
mother respite." (Case 23)
'Mother to live with her aunt unless otherwise agreed with CPFS.
Mother is not to leave Aunt's house with baby unless she is with aunt
or another approved in advance by CPFS unless otherwise agreed.
Aunt to immediately contact CPFS or crisis care if plan is not com-
plied with or if there are concerns about Mother's mental health."
(Case 30)
3.5. Financial stability
A number of parents (18 %) were required to demonstrate the ability
to manage finances in order to provide for their children and to meet
their children's needs. In some cases parents were required to undergo
financial counselling and/or voluntary income management particularly
if they were not able to successfully demonstrate an ability to budget.
There were also examples in which parents were instructed not to seek
financial assistance from family or the Department. Examples include:
"Mother to demonstrate ability to manage finances appropriately
and responsibly that will enable her to provide for the children."
(Case 33)
"Mother must undergo financial counselling— progress and plan to
pay off debts and manage living costs." (Case 13)
'Parents to demonstrate they can manage their money in order to
always have sufficient for essentials. Dept will consider use of income
management in the future if parents cannot successfully learn to
budget." (Case 22)
"Mother to demonstrate good understanding of financial manage-
ment and prioritise child's needs over her own. Mo not to seek
financial assistance from family or Department. Mo to consider
entering voluntary income management to demonstrate she priori-
tises payment of bills, rent and food." (Case 8)
3.6. Accommodation
There were a large proportion of parents (72 %) in which safety plans
stipulated a requirement to obtain and maintain stable, safe, hygienic
accommodation. Wording typical of this requirement was:
'to obtain and maintain stable, safe, hygienic accommodation for
children." (Case 17)
Some parents in their safety plan requested assistance from the
Department for accommodation which included parents who were being
released from prison, and mothers who were trying to obtain housing/
accommodation due to domestic violence:
'Father has requested assistance with accommodation following
release from prison." (Case 7)
"Mother told Department (CPFS) she would take a copy of her
Violence Restraining Order to Housing to assist with priority

tions." (Case 22)
While there were cases in which the Department assisted parents in
obtaining accommodation there were cases in which the Department
were clear in plans that while referral information would be provided
the onus was on parents to obtain housing and address issues that led to
homelessness:
"Maintain safe and stable accommodation and addressed issues that
have led to her homelessness." (Case 13)
'Department will provide information relating to support agencies
and a support letter to Department of Housing relating to priority list.
Mother expected to source permanent accommodation herself,
maintain tenancy and demonstrate stability." (Case 24)
To demonstrate stable accommodation, it was common across safety
plans that the main evidence required was that parents provide "evi-
dence of a lease agreement and demonstration of stability of tenure over
a period of not less than 6 months".
3.7. Relationship counselling
There were a number of parents (20 %) that were required to attend
couples counselling to address relationship conflict. The requirement
was worded fairly consistently across these parent's safety plans:
"Mother and father to engage in couples counselling together to
address issues of communication, trust, respect and parenting. Goal
is to obtain a positive report from support service regarding partic-
ipation". (Case 17)

A large group of parents (59 %) had safety plans that had re-
quirements around domestic violence. Some parents were required to
end a relationship with an abusive partner and not to enter in any further
relationships with abusive partners. The onus in these safety plans
appeared to be on mothers who experienced domestic violence to ensure
they do not have a relationship with an abusive partner or potential
partner. There were also stipulations to notify police if violence occurs
or a Violence Restraining Order (VRO) was broken. Examples of these
requirements include:
"No physical contact with (a male mentioned)' (Case 4), "no further
incidents of domestic violence - including with any new partners or
other people' (Case 34), "To increase frequency or duration of con-
tact (with children) parents must: cease being involved in a domestic
violence relationship" (Case 19), and "Mother will need to demon-
strate she has the capacity to protect children from being exposed to
violence." (Case 39)
and.
'Mother to report to police if physically assaulted or attacked and for
her not to engage in any violence or assaults" (Case 11) and "report
all breaches by father of VRO or other orders to the police" (Case 22)
Some safety plans required children to go to someone in their safety/
support network or for fathers to walk away to avoid domestic violence
incidents:
Children and Youth Services Review 157 (2024) 107376
'Parents agree to stop arguing and for father to walk away from
mother to avoid further incidents." (Case 29).
'If parents argue children will go to grandparents/Aunty's house or
father will go for a walk to cool off." (Case 37)
"Mother and father will continue to protect children from violent
environments - If they argue father will leave the caravan to allow
the situation to cool down. Bottom line: If there continues to be
violence in front of the children the Department may recommend
that father leaves the family home until this issue is addressed.'
(Case 23)
Parents were often required to complete FDV or anger management
programs or counselling with more specific goals of demonstrated un-
derstanding of domestic violence and safety planning. Typical safety
requirement for mothers were:
'For mother to be ready for reunification she needs to: Complete an
anger management program and demonstrate ability to manage
conflict, problem solve, understand cycle of violence, power and
control and impact of DV on children. No further DV reports or vi-
Olent behaviours. If father perpetrates violent behaviour mother is to
take protective steps as per safety plan." (Case 10)
'Domestic Violence: Task: attend DV counselling programs. Goal:
obtain a positive report from counsellors regarding mother's
participation and understanding of the effect of DV on children.
Mother will need to demonstrate she has the capacity to protect
children from being exposed to violence." (Case 39)
'Parents will ensure that the children are not exposed to FDV and
will sort out their problems in a non-violent way so that children will
become healthy happy adults that will learn to resolve conflict in a
nonviolent manner. Mother — no reports of violence from the police
or community with father or any other family or community mem-
bers. DV counselling — to address issues related to DV including being
a victim of DV, and her understanding of the impact of DV on chil-
dren living in environment which it occurs." (Case 19)
"Mother to provide environment free from verbal and physical
violence by: attending and participating in therapeutic intervention
re DV; meeting with Dept workers to discuss and demonstrate un-
derstanding of DV; develop detailed personal safety plan for herself
and child; report all breaches by father of VRO or other orders to the
police. Dept will refer mother to DV program and fund any associated
costs. Dept will also consider referral to 'Safe at Home' service if
mother secures her own accommodation." (Case 22)
Similarly for fathers, particularly where fathers were perpetrators of
violence there were cases of specific requirements regarding courses and
programs as well as demonstrated understanding and behaviours:
'For father to be ready for reunification he needs to: Participate in an
anger management and DV program and demonstrate he has
addressed his issues with DV, anger management and impulse con-
trol for a period of time determined by the Dept." (Case 10)
'Father — no reports of violence from the police or community with
mother or any other family or community members. Behaviour
Change program— to address his role in DV including being a
perpetrator of DV, a victim of DV and his understanding of the
impact of DV on children living in the environment in which it oc-
curs." (Case 19)
'Father to provide environment free from verbal and physical
violence. Father to demonstrate alternate strategies apart from use of
violence, and that he understands impact of violence on safety and
wellbeing of child by: participating in men's behaviour change
program following release from prison and allowing Dept to seek info
regarding participation and engagement from program provider;
demonstrate ability to follow and abide by orders and instructions
issued by CPFS, Corrective Services and Police." (Case 22)

M. O'Donnell et al.
3.9. Drug and alcohol
A large number of parents (74 %) had requirements in relation to
drugs and alcohol in their safety plans.
Some cases stipulated that "Children will be in a home where there is
always a sober adult to look out for their safety and ensure that all their
basic needs are met" (Case 19). Other cases the Department stated that
"Parents wont drink alcohol when caring for children. If father wants to
drink more than 4 drinks he will go to his father' s house and return when
sober. If mother wants to drink she will do the same at her family's
house." (Case 37).
A large proportion (64 %) specifically had requirements around
urinalysis and drug testing with variable requirements ranging from
random urinalysis testing to weekly testing. Examples included:
'Random urinanalysis— Mother required to attend same day as
request. Father: Should he wish to have supervised visit he would
need to undergo drug screening." (Case 2)
"Task: complete random urinalysis weekly. Goal: To abstain from
illicit drug use and providing clean urine samples. A missed test will
be recorded as a contaminated sample. Period: minimum of 6
months." (Case 17)
"Parents to engage in urinalysis testing up to 3 times per week and
remain clean for 3 months." (Case 10)
'Drug and alcohol free for 6 months (required urine analysis and
random hair analysis)." (Case 1)
Parents were also commonly required to complete residential reha-
bilitation or drug and alcohol outreach programs. The requirements
were fairly consistent across the cases although there was some variation
on the detail of the requirement outlined. For instance, the first example
below relied on professional advice on whether the parent had met re-
quirements and made sufficient progress, however, the third example
also required a drug relapse prevention plan:
'Mother to remain drug free by completing residential rehabilitation
or outreach program. Goal: abstain from illicit drug use. Period: for
length of program or on professional advisement that all re-
quirements completed and sufficient progress made." (Case 17)
"Attend drug rehabilitation facility or engage in outreach drug and
alcohol counselling. Department can provide service information but
parents to initiate contact and ensure attendance. Parents to under-
stand reasons for drug use, develop alternative coping strategies and
understand impact of drug use on parenting ability/capacity." (Case
12)
'Mother to demonstrate that she can apply what she has learned
about DV, drug use and anger management over a period of no less
than 6 months. To abstain from speed, methamphetamines and
amphetamines, reduce marijuana use, and undertake urinalysis
when requested. Mo to also have a clear drug relapse prevention plan
outlining what she will do when she feels like using, who she will get
help from and what they will do." (Case 13)
There was also variation in the amount of support offered by the
Department across cases in relation to drug and alcohol requirements.
Some cases the Department offered to provide the referral to drug and
alcohol services whereas others were required to contact the services
and/or admit themselves.
"Task: attend and complete residential rehab program. Mother ex-
pected to contact centre and admit herself." (Case 16)
There was also variation in the level of financial support for parents
to be able to attend counselling with some getting some financial
assistance and other parents required to be financially responsible for
counselling. Some examples include:
Children and Youth Services Review 157 (2024) 107376
"Counselling: engage in counselling sessions (10 sessions with a
psychologist covered by Medicare and Dept will cover cost of gap)."
(Case 38)
"Mother to enter a detox and rehabilitation program and complete
16 weeks of program to graduate. Mother to attend and be financially
responsible for regular counselling regarding her drug dependency."
(Case 8)
3.10. Mental health
Over half the cases (54 %) had mental health related requirements.
The most prevalent of these was that parents were required to get a
mental health assessment and counselling. Common examples of this
requirement included:
"Mental health assessment/counselling: Task: Undertake psycho-
logical assessment to determine if there are mental health issues that
may impact on parenting capacity and anger management and
attend counselling service. Goal: address any mental health and
anger management concerns (e.g. obtain a mental health plan from a
GP for referral to psychologist (a number of sessions will be covered
by Medicare). Parent expected to contact services and book own
appointments. Period: number of sessions determined by counsel-
lors." (Case 16)
"Counselling: engage in counselling sessions (10 sessions with a
psychologist covered by Medicare and Dept will cover cost of gap).
Dept would like mother to address issues of past trauma, identify
triggers which can cause stress and poor mental health, learn
appropriate coping strategies and how to avoid negative coping
strategies (e.g. alcohol use). Dept will require a progress report from
counsellor." (Case 38)
There were a small number (5 %), in addition to a mental health
assessment, where there were requirements to have an assessment for
intellectual capacity and how it may impact on the ability to adequately
parent:
'Department needs to see that mother's mental health and intellec-
tual capacity are sufficient to provide for the safe parenting of infant.
Counselling and mental health — Mother will attend appointments
arranged for her mental health and cognitive functioning to be
assessed. Mother will continue to attend counselling until the rele-
vant service provider confirms that she is able to self-manage her
mental health. Reunification timetable to transition infant home:
Dept will consider reunification of infant to care of Mother once
following occurs: Receipt of a mental health and cognitive func-
tioning assessment stating that Mother is capable of providing infant
with his daily needs and is willing and able to keep infant safe." (Case
14)
"Undertake assessment of cognitive functioning. Undertake psycho-
logical assessment with a Department psychologist to assess
parenting capacity, including capacity to learn, modify behaviours
and sustain behavioural change. Follow through with recommen-
dations from the psychological assessment regarding any further
supports in line with reunification goals." (Case 21)
Some mother's were required to attend specialist mental health
clinics or assessments which were exemplified by the cases below:
"Task: Continue to see psychiatrist at KEMH (maternity hospital) in
women's and newborn services. Goal: follow-up all recommenda-
tions. Period: dependent on recommendations from mental health
providers. Mother to continue to engage with KEMH psychiatrist and
take medication." (Case 17)
"Mother to undergo a neurological assessment in relation to previous
injuries sustained from DV and reported seizures. Mother to maintain
current mental health treatment plan — medication and further
therapy." (Case 31)

3.11. Parenting skills and capacity
There were a large proportion (67 %) of cases where mothers and
fathers were required to address parenting issues in their safety plans. In
some cases, this involved undertaking parenting courses (26 %) which
primarily included the requirement:
"Parenting: Task: attend age-appropriate parenting courses such as
Circle of Security. Goal: obtain positive reports from facilitators and
contact supervisors regarding participation and understanding and
meeting children's needs. Period: ongoing." (Case 17)
A large proportion of parents (28 %) were asked to complete a
parenting capacity assessment which had varied wording regarding
what was to be assessed. Some examples include:
'Mother to participate in parenting capacity assessment by Depart-
mental psychologist (or other professional) to provide an opinion re:
attachment between mother and child, mother's insight into child's
needs, mother's capacity to meet child's needs, any psychological/
mental health/personality issues that may impact mother's capacity
to parent, mother's capacity to prioritise child's safety within her
lifestyle and interpersonal relationships." (Case 17)
"Undertake psychological assessment with a Dept psychologist to
assess parenting capacity, including capacity to learn, modify be-
haviours and sustain behavioural change." (Case 21)
Some children had specific health issues (e.g. born pre-term/low
birth weight), therefore, parents were required to attend medical ap-
pointments and engage with child health nurses/health professionals to
meet their children's medical needs:
'Mother to take baby to all medical appointments and vaccinations.
Mother to accept visits from and cooperate with the nurse from
KEMH. Mother to accept visits from and attend visits with the child
health nurse. Mother to engage with Best Beginnings once the
referral is activated. Depending on feedback from KEMH during her
two day stay regarding mother crafting skills CPFS may require
Mother to engage with Ngala and attend the residential program."
(Case 30)
'Mother to demonstrate she can meet child's therapy needs by
attending appointments and completing daily at-home therapy ex-
ercises as required. Mother to attend child's medical appointments
and meet with therapists to learn how to facilitate child's daily at-
home therapy sessions." (Case 16)
"For the infant to be returned to parents they need to demonstrate
they will engage with CPFS and other relevant agencies such as child
health and Aboriginal health services to ensure that the children are
safe and receive adequate health care, food and supervision. They
need to ensure to attend all medical appointments for the infant and
ensure that they get immediate medical attention when required.
Parents need to demonstrate that at all times that they can consis-
tently provide care that will address all of child's medical needs such
as attending all necessary appointments-physiotherapy, ophthal-
mology and OT as well as providing care at home that ensures that he
does not regress developmentally." (Case 19)
In many safety plans there were requirements about contact visits
and some outlined specific behavioural expectations:
"Contact with children remains positive by focusing on children's
needs and attending contact or rearrange that they can't contact.
Mother to engage in a group/service that address parenting issues,
participate actively and receive a favourable report that confirms this
and that she has developed positive parenting strategies." (Case 31)
"Contact: attend regular contact, remain child focused, regulate
emotions and mental health during visits." (Case 38)
"To demonstrate ongoing commitment to child by: meeting child's
needs during contact when in prison; consistently attending contact
Children and Youth Services Review 157 (2024) 107376
following release from prison; communicating with Dept regarding
plans while child in care and throughout reunification process."
(Case 22)
A number of parents were also asked to complete in-home parenting
support programs or reunification programs:
"Complete parenting program and participate in home parenting
support program. Mother acts protectively towards (children), stays
drug free, responds to children's medical, educational, physical and
psychological needs to a good enough level." (Case 15)
"Mother will work with Centrecare Djooraminda Reunification Ser-
vice to learn about medical needs of children and develop a plan of
how needs will be met, establishing a routine, keeping house clean,
discipline strategies, health eating and food prep. Mother will
maintain and demonstrate her learning for a period of 6 months
before reunification can occur. Mo needs to support children in going
to school every day." (Case 13)
A number of safety plans outlined the progression of contact based
on meeting specific conditions and favourable reports. In some cases,
this included parallel planning if the parents were unable to meet these
conditions and requirements. An example (Case 23) is outlined below:
'Progression of contact. Stage 1: Where contact has been assessed as
positive and in the best interests of the children it will progress to-
ward increased supervised periods within a period of not less than 3
months once parent/s demonstrate their ability to: -attend every
contact on time -provide clean urinalysis, -participate in counselling
for drug use/ DV; and -commence a psychological and parenting
capacity assessment.
Stage 2: Once parent/s successfully meet these conditions and con-
tact has been assessed as positive and in the children's best interests
then unsupervised contact will be offered providing for parent/s to
leave the venue where contact will be held with [children].
Stage 3: On successful completion of Stage 2 unsupervised contact
will progress toward home visits during which time a referral will be
made to a reunification programme.
Stage 4: On successful completion of stage 3, a transition toward full
reunification will commence.
Parallel planning: In the event that parent/s have not been able to
commence addressing the requirements for reunification within a 12
month period, the Department will develop a parallel plan for the
children's long term care and may seek to revoke the time limited
orders and replace them with until 18 orders so that the children can
be placed permanently."
3.12. Co-occurring family issues/service referrals
On average families had three family issues or service referrals to
address the departments concerns. Of the 39 cases 28 % had three family
issues/service referrals with 23 % of families having four. The majority
of families were asked to address drug and alcohol concerns or attend
drug and alcohol services/ rehabilitation (79 %) followed by parenting
services/parenting capacity assessments (51 %), mental health services
(49 %), and domestic violence services (49 %).
4. Discussion
This research provides important evidence from a court file review of
families going through care proceedings for their infants who were
removed into out-of-home care due to child protection concerns in the
child's first year of life. Of the 39 court files analysed, 36 % of the
families were reported to child protection prenatally and 64 % were
reported postnatally. Half of the cases involved infants who were
Aboriginal (49 %). One in five infants were removed directly from the
maternity ward with infants removed into care on average at 4.9
8


M. O'Donnell et al.
months. The majority of the infants had siblings (77 %) with a large
proportion having an elder sibling in care (51 %).
The main child protection concerns related to domestic violence (51
%), drug and alcohol use (49 %) and mental health issues (41 %). The
majority of these cases resulted in final orders with a large proportion
having until 18 protection orders (41 %), and 23 % having the orders
revoked or withdrawn with the infant restored to the family. For infants
that were reunified, the average time to reunification was 14.5 months.
Half of the infants were placed in foster care, half were placed in kinship
care, and a large proportion of extended family were assessed for care
and found suitable, although some did not have the capacity for a full-
time care role.
While in all cases, the Department had legal representation, 59 % of
mothers had legal representation at final orders and to a lesser extent
fathers (54 %). The challenge in undertaking the case file reviews was
that the majority of the information contained in the file was evidence
filed on behalf of the Department with only 15 % of cases having a
parent affidavit on file. This is in contrast to the case file review con-
ducted in New South Wales where the majority of cases had parent af-
fidavits presented to the court as evidence (Taplin et al, under review).
The majority of cases (90 %) had information from the Department
regarding safety plans which articulated the requirements of parents for
their infant to be reunified to their care. To our knowledge, there are no
previous studies that have examined the safety plans in case files to
determine parental requirements. There was also no information on the
files of how the safety goals and requirements were decided upon or
whether they were developed in collaboration with parents or advo-
cates/support workers. A greater understanding of this process would be
useful in research going forward. In many of the files the requirements
were worded very similarly indicating that they are commonly used
requirements across the Department.
There were a large proportion of cases where parents were required
to actively engage with the Department, with some articulating specific
behavioural requirements including responding to calls, attending
meetings and being respectful. Engagement has been described as a
process of 'establishing effective working relationships so that there can
be a shared understanding of goals and a shared commitment'
(Parenting Research Centre, 2017). As outlined in a scoping review of
engagement of birth parents in the child protection system, many factors
can impact on parent' s ability to engage including the impact on families
of multiple and complex needs, previous involvement with child pro-
tection (including parents being a child in care), history of stolen gen-
eration and government mistrust, cultural differences, and risk or deficit
based approaches to families by workers
(Parenting Research Centre,
). It is noted that in some cases the Department provided mobile
2017
phones to assist parents with contact with case workers. Engagement
strategies by the Department and other service providers are essential
for working with these families, many of whom are faced with high
levels of adversity, historical mistrust, challenges accessing services, and
dealing with multiple and complex needs.
Many of the families had requirements in relation in financial and
housing stability. There is a wealth of evidence that families facing
poverty are more likely to be involved in child protection services
Bywaters et al., 2016). The challenge for these families is not only
ensuring that they can provide evidence of their ability to budget and
meet the financial needs of their family but also attend appointments to
address their mental health, drug and alcohol use, and domestic violence
issues that are resulting in the safety concerns by the Department. In
some of the safety plans this was acknowledged by caseworkers who
specifically stated what financial assistance would be provided to enable
parents to access assessments and counselling. The associated issue of
housing was also mentioned in 72 % of the safety plans with most
required to maintain stable, safe and hygienic accommodation. Given
the complexity of issues that these families are facing, maintaining
stable accommodation is a challenging issue. This was mentioned in a
number of safety plans where mothers fleeing domestic violence were
Children and Youth Services Review 157 (2024) 107376
utilising violence restraining orders to assist with priority housing and
emergency housing services. Some safety plans however were clear that
while the Department would provide the mother with a list of housing
support services and a letter of support relating to the priority list the
onus was specifically on the mother to actively source accommodation
and in some cases address the issues that led to homelessness. Given the
social housing waiting list in WA which is approximately 19,000
households with a 2 year average wait time, many of these families will
struggle to maintain stable accommodation in the short term to meet this
). The additional challenge is that to
requirement (
Shelter WA, 2022
address the other concerns of mental health and drug and alcohol use, it
is essential to have stable housing to provide stability for recovery
Padgett, 2020)
Domestic violence was another important child protection concern in
many of the safety plans. There was variation in the requirements made
on families. Many families were required to address this by being
referred to FDV/anger management programs or for counselling with
some required to develop safety plans and to use a safety/support
network. Requirements in relation to perpetrator accountability was
mentioned in a number of the safety plans which put the onus on per-
petrators to address their violent behaviour. However, there was some
concerning requirements in which the onus appeared to be on the
mother to demonstrate the ability to protect children from being
exposed to violence and to not enter into any future relationships with
an abusive partner. There is also a challenge in that police reports could
be used as evidence as seen in cases and, therefore, if a mother contacts
police to report DV then this could potentially be used as evidence that
she is not able to protect her children from exposure to violence and
abuse. In addition, given that many of the families had difficulty
maintaining stable accommodation this would preclude them from
being provided some of the intensive support programs which would
support mothers facing domestic violence and the associated impacts of
trauma on mental health. This issue is broader than child protection's
jurisdiction and will require ongoing government strategies to address
the social housing shortages and the complex interaction of services to
meet families with multiple and complex needs and who are experi-
encing family violence (Commonwealth of Australia, 2022)
The complexity of issues described in the case files does indicate the
need for intensive support to assist families. Families on average had
three family issues /service referrals to address the concerns of the
Department, with the main areas being drug and alcohol, parenting,
mental health, and domestic violence. The requirements across the
safety plans were numerous and many families were required to be
referred and seek support from multiple agencies. There was no clear
indication from the safety plans who would provide case management
support for the family or assist them to meet the Department's re-
quirements. This is a challenge in the service provision space as the level
of intensity required to support these families with multiple and com-
plex issues will be high and for services who are procured to only pro-
vide DV, mental health or substance use services, it is a challenge to
provide families with the wrap around support they need for successful
outcomes. This highlights the need for greater sophistication in strate-
gies to support these families who cross multiple service systems and
have a high complexity of needs. Supporting families to engage with pre-
birth and post-birth safety planning where their voices and articulation
of needs is vital in ensuring that these families are fully engaged and
supported throughout this process. There is preliminary evidence that
pre-birth independent facilitators utilised in WA pre-birth meetings have
been viewed by families as important to enabling them to have a greater
voice in these meetings (Trew et al., 2022). Aboriginal family led deci-
Sion making has been shown to be effective in Victoria and is being
trialled in WA to enable greater self-determination and cultural safety
for Aboriginal families involved in developing family plans (Department
of Human Services, 2012). Victoria is also leading the way in their
innovative court model Marram-Ngala Ganbu to address the over-
representation of Aboriginal children in care with WA trialling an
9


M. O'Donnell et al.
alternative court model for families with cases prioritised for those
families involved in child protection processes during pregnancy and
infancy (
Arabena et al., 2019)
While this research has provided evidence of the care proceedings
involving infants in their first year of life where there are child protec-
tion concerns, it does have limitations. The majority of the case files
accessed were based in the metropolitan area and unfortunately, we did
not have capacity to review cases at regional courts. An understanding of
these cases is important particularly given the over-representation of
Aboriginal infants and the challenges of accessing services and support
in regional and remote communities. What was particularly disap-
pointing in the case file review was the lack of evidence in the files that
was used to support families or provide evidence to refute the claims
made by the Department. Therefore, the predominant views presented
to the court and in the files were in relation to the Department's child
protection concerns. As the proceedings in the court are not available to
researchers this provides a gap in the evidence and would require re-
searchers to seek permission from the court to be present during pro-
ceedings. There is also no evidence within the files to determine the
effectiveness of services, assessment validity or the ability of families to
meet the caseworker requirements. While these limitations should be
addressed in future research, the evidence from this study on care pro-
ceedings and the requirements of families to gain restoration of their
infants fills a gap in the current research.
Over the last ten years we have seen an increase in the number of
pregnant mothers and families being notified to child protection services
nationally and internationally, as well as a rise in the number of infants
coming into the care system. All nations are committed to ensuring that
children can grow up safely with their family and therefore ongoing
international research and evidence is required to determine the effec-
tiveness of processes to address safety concerns and support families to
achieve optimal outcomes. There is also the need to ensure that strate-
gies are sophisticated enough across government to meet the needs of
families who are facing adversity at a level of service provision appro-
priate for the complexity of issues and importantly families have a voice
in this process.

Postpartum medication for opioid use disorder
outcomes associated with prenatal treatment and
neighborhood-level social determinants

BACKGROUND: Opioid use disorder is a leading cause of death
through the year postpartum.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the association of neighbor-
hood-level social determinants of health and prenatal opioid use disorder
treatment receipt with the outcomes of medication treatment for opioid use
disorder through the year postpaitum among a cohort of birthing people.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a population-based retrospective coh01t
study that used state Medicaid claims and enrollment data for the 1690
individuals who delivered a live infant between July 1 , 2016 and Decem-
ber 31 , 2020 and received medication for opioid use disorder at delivery.
The primary exposure was the state Health Opportunity Index, a composite
measure of social determinants of health linked at the census-tract level.
Secondary exposures included comprehensiveness of opioid use disorder
treatment and duration of medication treatment for opioid use disorder
received prenatally. Outcomes included the duration and continuity of
postpartum medication treatment for opioid use disorder, operationalized
as the time from delivery to the discontinuation of medication treatment
for opioid use disorder, and percentage of days covered by medication
treatment for opioid use disorder within the 12 months after delivery,
respectively.
RESULTS: Within the study sample, 711 deliveries were to billhing
people in the lowest state Health OppMunity Index tercile (indicating high
burden of negative social determinants of health), 647 in the middle state
Health Opportunity Index tercile, and 332 in the highest state Health
Opportunity Index tercile. Using stepwise multivariable regression (Cox
proportional hazards and negative binomial models) guided by a socioeco-
logical framework, prenatal receipt of more comprehensive opioid use dis-
order treatment and/or longer duration of prenatal medication treatment
for opioid use disorder was associated with improved 1 -year postpartum
opioid use disorder treatment outcomes (duration and continuity of medi-
cation treatment for opioid use disorder). When the state Health OppMu-
nity Index was added to the models, these significant associations
remained stable, with the state Health Opportunity Index not demonstrat-
ing an association with the outcomes (duration hazard ratio, 1.39; 95%
confidence intetwal, 0.551—3.512; continuity relative risk, 1.024; 95%
confidence interval, 0.323—3.247).
CONCLUSION: Targeted efforts at expanding access to and quality
of evidence-based opioid use disorder treatments for reproductive-age
people across the life course should be prioritized within the spec-
trum of work aimed at eradicating disparities in pregnancy-related
mortality.

Introduction
ubstance use—related deaths, namely
S
opioid overdose, are the leading
cause of pregnancy-related mortality in
the United States, with most deaths

occurring in the year after delivery. In
addition to maternal morbidity and mor-
tality, untreated opioid use disorder
(OUD) carries additional risks for the

is the most effective path forward to com-
bat the overdose crisis. However, stark
8—10
disparities in MOUD outcomes exist,
11—13
including among birthing people.
These disparities are hypothesized to be
reflections of a culmination of higher-
order factors (eg, structural and systemic
racism, inequities in health care access)
rather than solely contributions by indi-
vidual-level factors demarcating the social
group burdened by the disparity (eg, race,
ethnicity).9 14 The use of a socioecological
framework to guide investigations of
OUD treatment outcomes is an innovative
avenue to achieve a more comprehensive
understanding of the underlying contribu-
15,16
especially social
tors to inequities,
17,18
determinants of health (SDoH),
to
ultimately inform intervention develop-
19
ment. However, investigations like these
have largely focused on individual-level
SDoH, rather than SDoH at the neighbor-
hood level, despite other areas of medicine
indicating their important contributions to
20—22
health disparities.
The objective of this study was to
identify the association of neighbor-
hood-level SDoH with MOUD outcomes
(duration, continuity of receipt) through
the I-year postpartum period among a
cohort of birthing people in a Medicaid-
expanded state, using Medicaid claims
data (2016—2020). Secondarily, we assess
associations with measures of prenatal
OUD treatment receipt (comprehensive-
ness and MOUD duration). Within an
adapted socioecological model (Figure)
we evaluated stepwise the contribution
of 4 categories of factors: individual-level
demographics, parent—infant dyad and
health-related variables, aspects of pre-
natal OUD treatment delivery, and
neighborhood-level SDoH. SDoH of the
birthing person's community were com-
prehensively captured using the state

Why was this study conducted?
This study aimed to identify the association of neighborhood-level social deter-
minants of health and prenatal opioid use disorder treatment receipt with medi-
cation treatment outcomes for opioid use disorder through the year postpartum
among a cohort of birthing people.
Key findings
This retrospective cohort study linked Medicaid claims (2016—2020) with a cen-
sus tract—level measure of 32 social determinants for members receiving medi-
cation for opioid use disorder at delivery (N=1690). Prenatal receipt of more
comprehensive opioid use disorder treatment and/or longer duration of prenatal
medication treatment for opioid use disorder was associated with improved 1-
year postpartum outcomes of opioid use disorder medication treatment across
neighborhood levels of social determinants.
What does this add to what is known?
To improve outcomes of postpartum people with opioid use disorder, interven-
tions should prioritize the expansion of medication treatments and targeting of
neighborhood-level social determinants.
Opportunity Index (HOI). We hypoth-
esized that the neighborhood-level
SDoH for the birthing person, as mea-
sured by the HOI, along with the
degree of prenatal MOUD, would be
associated with improved postpartum
MOUD outcomes.
Materials and Methods
Data source and study sample
This population-level
retrospective
cohort study used state Medicaid claims
and enrollment data from the Depart-
ment of Medical Services for individuals
who delivered a live infant between July
1, 2016 to December 31, 2020. This
time frame was selected to obtain the
FIGURE
most recent data available from state
Medicaid claims. For all deliveries cov-
ered by full Medicaid benefits, member
IDs for the birthing individuals and
infants were linked (stillbirths not
included in linkage by the Department
of Medical Services) and then made
available to the study team. We con-
structed measures of diagnosed condi-
tions, treatment, and service utilization.
The unit of analysis for this study is the
delivery. Singleton and multiple gesta-
tion births are treated as a single deliv-
ery, and multiple deliveries from a
single birthing individual during the
study period are treated as independent
observations with adjustments to

standard errors clustered at the patient
level. We restricted our sample to birth-
ing individuals receiving MOUD at the
time of delivery. To account for mistim-
ing of claims to actual medication pro-
vision, we included MOUD claims
within 14 days after delivery. After
excluding deliveries without valid cen-
sus tract information to facilitate HOI
linkage, the final sample included 1690
deliveries (eFigure 1). A university insti-
tutional review board approved this
study.
Outcome measures
The primary outcomes were postpar-
tum MOUD duration and continuity of
MOUD receipt. MOUD was captured
by pharmacy claims (ie, buprenorphine)
and procedure codes (ie, methadone).
MOUD duration was operationalized as
the number of days to first MOUD dis-
continuity after delivery, allowing for
up to a 30-day gap between MOUD
claim dates. An "allowable" 30-day gap
was intentionally selected on the basis
of clinical experience and to account for
mistiming of claims to medication pro-
vision. If individuals switched between
MOUD type, this was not considered a
gap nor discontinuation. In addition,
overlapping pharmacy claims' dates
were considered to allow for surplus
days' supplies to accumulate (ie, shifting
refill date forward for early refills).
MOUD continuity was operationalized
as the cumulative number of days cov-
ered by MOUD divided by the cumula-
tive number of days enrolled in full-
benefit Medicaid within the 12 months
after delivery.
Main exposure of interest:
neighborhood-level social
determinants of health
Neighborhood-level SDoH were mea-
sured by the state Department of Health's
HOI.23 The HOI is derived from dozens
of social, economic, educational, demo-
graphic, and environmental community
variables. These variables are sequen-
tially aggregated into a single composite
HOI (
Supplemental Table), similar to
other established neighborhood-level
25
SDoH measures. Each delivery's HOI
was identified at the census-tract level


using the birthing individual's address at
the time of delivery (or if not available,
the address corresponding to the closest
time frame to delivery). We describe the
variability in outcomes of our cohort by
composite HOI terciles. We used the
composite HOI as a continuous variable
in our multivariable models.
Secondary exposures of interest:
prenatal opioid use disorder
treatment receipt
Prenatal OUD treatment receipt was
captured in detail using 2 measures:
duration of MOUD before delivery and
prenatal utilization of comprehensive
OUD treatment services. Prenatal
MOUD duration was captured by phar-
macy and procedure claims in the 12
months preceding delivery (to encom-
pass both individuals who initiated
MOUD during pregnancy and individ-
uals who became pregnant already on
MOUD). To capture OUD treatment
services in addition to MOUD, we used
the OUD Treatment Comprehensive-
ness Index, a measure previously
13
devised by our group on the basis of
the work of Edwards et al.26 Nine ser-
vice categories were included in the
index: peer support, case management,
provider assessment, behavioral health,
medication management, drug moni-
toring, health screening, family therapy,
and psychiatric evaluation. If a member
had a claim for at least 1 service within
its category during the 12 months
before birth, that was counted as having
received that service category. For each
delivery, the OUD Treatment Compre-
hensiveness Index was calculated as the
total number of service categories with
at least 1 received service (range, 0—9).
Other predictors of postpartum
outcomes for medication treatments
for opioid use disorder
Guided by our study framework
Figure), we evaluated in a stepwise
manner the effects of (1) individual-
level demographics, (2) parent—infant
dyad and health-related variables, (3)
prenatal OUD treatment (secondary
exposure variables), and (4) the HOI
(main exposure of interest) on postpar-
tum MOUD outcomes. These variables
were selected on the basis of existing lit-
erature indicating their associations
27,28
with OUD treatment outcomes.
Individual-level variables included age
(years), race/ethnicity, and urban/rural
location. Race and ethnicity were defined
by member self-report on intake survey
at the time of Medicaid enrollment (with
no missing race/ethnicity values) and
categorized as Black, non-Hispanic,
White, non-Hispanic, and other race/
ethnicity. The "Other" race/ethnicity cat-
egory included individuals self-identify-
ing with Hispanic ethnicity (with any
stated race because of small numbers)
and any other categories except for Black
or White, non-Hispanic.
Parent—infant dyad and health varia-
bles included prenatal maternal diagno-
sis of comorbid mental health condition
or substance use disorder, 23 emer-
gency department visits or overdose
event in the 12 months preceding deliv-
ery, delivery type, preterm delivery, and
neonatal abstinence syndrome diagno-
sis. Comorbid diagnoses and overdose
events were captured by ICD-IO (Inter-
national Classification of Diseases,
Tenth Revision) codes. Notably, over-
dose events not involving medical care
with a Medicaid claim were not
included in our data set. Delivery type
was categorized as vaginal, cesarean, or
undetermined. Preterm birth was
defined as delivery before 37 weeks of
gestation. Neonatal abstinence syn-
drome diagnosis was captured by Med-
icaid claims for the infant.
Analysis
First, descriptive analyses, including for
unadjusted MOUD outcomes, report
on the total sample as well as by terciles
of the composite HOI. Next, multivari-
able regression identified factors associ-
ated with our MOUD outcomes.
Specifically, a Cox proportional hazards
model was used for the outcome of
MOUD duration, and a negative bino-
mial regression model was used for the
outcome of MOUD continuity. For
MOUD duration, we allowed for delays
(up to 14 days) in their MOUD claim
dates, and censoring occurred at either
death or disenrollment from Medicaid.
Following our study framework, we
Original Research
stepwise included our 4 categories of
predictor variables into the models,
with the HOI being the last variable
added. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (CIS) are reported
for Cox proportional hazards models;
rate ratios and 95% CIs were reported
for negative binomial regression mod-
els. All models controlled for secular
changes over time (eg, COVID-19 pan-
demic) by including the calendar quar-
ter in which the member delivered.
Analyses were conducted in SAS soft-
ware (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
Stata, version 17 (StataCorp LLC, Col-
29,30
lege Station, TX).
Results
Among the sample of 1690 Medicaid-
covered patients with deliveries occur-
ring between July 1, 2016 and December
31, 2020 who were to receiving MOUD,
711 (42%) were birthing people in the
lowest HOI tercile (indicating high bur-
den of negative SDoH), 647 (38%) in
the middle HOI tercile, and 332 (20%)
in the highest HOI tercile (Table I
Most deliveries were to White, non-His-
panic birthing people (89.0%), with less
than a tenth to Black, non-Hispanic
birthing people (8.7%) and people with
other race/ethnicity. However, these
proportions differed across HOI ter-
ciles, with 14.4% of deliveries in the
lowest tercile being to Black, non-His-
panic birthing people, as opposed to
only 3.9% in the highest tercile.
At the time of delivery, birthing peo-
ple had been receiving MOUD for dif-
ferent durations that did not vary
significantly across HOI terciles: 9.8%
for month, 26.7% for 1 to 4 months,
32.0% for 5 to 8 months, and 28.6 for at
least 9 months. Similarly, almost half of
the sample received at least 4 OUD
treatment components, in addition to
MOUD, during pregnancy (46.2%),
with 13.6% receiving no additional
OUD treatment services, 9.0% receiving
1 service, 13.8% 2 services, and 17.5% 3
services (Table 1
Unadjusted study outcomes did not
vary across HOI terciles. For postpar-
tum MOUD duration, 61.5% of patients
continued MOUD for at least 9 of 12
months after delivery (60.2% in the

ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine the association of placental levels of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), lead (Pb),
manganese (Mn), and chromium (Cr) with birth outcomes (birth weight, length, and head circumference, low
birth weight [LBW], gestational age, preterm delivery, and small for gestational age [SGA]) in mother-child pairs
from the Environment and Childhood (INMA) Project in Spain.
Methods: Metal concentrations were measured in placenta tissue samples randomly selected from five INMA
cohorts. Data on birth outcomes were obtained from medical records. Associations were assessed in a sub-sample
of 327 mother-infant pairs by regression models adjusted for confounding factors and for all metals simulta-
neously. Effect modification by sex was also evaluated.
Results: Elevated placental Cd levels ( > 5.79 vs. < 3.30 ng/g) were associated with reduced birth weight
(—111.8g, 95%C1 = -215.6;
—8.06, p-trend = 0.01) and length (—0.62 cm, 95%CI = —1.20;
-0.04, p-
trend = 0.02), while a 10% increase in Cd was associated with 1.21 -fold increased odds (95%CI = 1.01; 1.43) of
LBW in the global sample but with 14% lower odds (95%CI = 0.78; 0.96) of preterm delivery in males
= 0.10). Detected (vs. undetected) Hg was associated with reduced head circumference 0.49 cm,
(P
inte raction
95%C1 = -1.00; 0.03) in females -
— 0.03). A 10% increase in placental Mn was associated with slight
increases in gestational age (0.04 weeks, 95%CI = 0.01; 0.07) in the global sample and in head circumference
—0.01; 0.10) in females (P
= 0.03). Elevated Cr levels ( > 99.6 vs. < 56.1 ng/g)
(0.05 cm, 95%C1 =
intera c tion
were associated with reduced birth length (—0.68 cm, 95%CI = —1.33; —0.04, p-trend = 0.02) and slightly
increased gestational age (0.35 weeks, 95%CI = —0.07; 0.77, p-trend = 0.08) in the global sample. As and Pb
were detected in few placentas (27% and 13%, respectively) and were not associated with any studied birth
outcome.
Conclusions: Data suggest that in utero exposure to Cd, Hg, and Cr could adversely affect fetal growth, whereas
Mn and Cr appear to have a positive effect on gestational age. Given the relatively small number of subjects, sex-
specific associations should be interpreted with caution.

1. Introduction
Adverse birth outcomes such as low birth weight (LBW) and preterm
birth are multifactorial conditions with environmental, socio-cultural,
physiological, and nutritional components. LBW and preterm birth are
major determinants of neonatal morbidity and mortality and are closely
associated with the risk of developmental problems and chronic dis-
Barker, 2004; Crump et al., 2011). LBW can result from preterm
eases (
delivery and/or intrauterine growth restriction, commonly assessed as
small for gestational age (SGA). Arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), mercury
(Hg), and lead (Pb) are well-known environmental heavy metal(loid)s
that top the list of priority hazardous substances in the Agency for Toxic
Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) (
ATSDR, 1999, 2007a;
2007b, 2012). They are recognized as toxic during critical windows of
fetal and infant development and may cause intrauterine growth re-
striction and fetal loss.
A number of studies of populations in areas with very high en-
vironmental levels of As and Cd, such as Bangladesh, India, Japan,
China, and Chile, have shown adverse associations between prenatal
exposure to As and/or Cd and birth outcomes, including reductions in
birth weight, length, and head circumference, placental weight, and
gestational age (A1-Saleh et al., 2015; Esteban-Vasallo et al., 2012;
Kippier et al., 2012a, 2012b; Laine et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2011; Menai
et al., 2012; Milton et al., 2017; Quansah et al., 2015; sun et al., 2014;
Zhang et al., 2004
), and a higher risk of preterm delivery (Milton et al.,
2017; Rahman et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2016) and SGA (
A1 Saleh et al.,
). However, few data have been published on
2015; Menai et al., 2012
the developmental effects of low-to-moderate As and Cd exposure
(Quansah et al., 2015).
Although epidemiological studies increasingly support the associa-
tion of in utero exposure to Pb and Hg with adverse pregnancy out-
comes, the evidence is less consistent than for As and Cd, especially in
the case of Hg (Vrijheid et al., 2016). Results of studies in populations
with different environmental Pb exposure levels have not been con-
clusive in relation to birth size (A1-Saleh et al., 2014; Esteban-Vasallo
et al., 2012; Johnston et al., 2014; Lamichhane et al., 2018; Sun et al.,
2014; Taylor et al., 2015; wang et al., 2017a; zhu et al., 2010
), preterm
delivery (Taylor et al., 2015; Vigeh et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2010) or
Rodosthenous et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2017a; Zhu et al., 2010).
SGA (
Conflicting findings have also been observed for Hg, and an association
of prenatal exposure to moderate Hg levels with preterm delivery and
reduced size at birth has been found by some authors (A1-Saleh et al.,
2014; Gundacker et al., 2010; Karagas et al., 2012; Vigeh et al., 2018;
) but not by others (Bashore et al., 2014; Drouillet-
Xue et al., 2007
Pinard et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2013; Karagas et al., 2012).
Some essential metals such as manganese (Mn) and chromium (Cr)
can also be toxic to humans if present at high levels. Excessive prenatal
exposure to Mn has mainly been associated with neurodevelopmental
delay in children (Rodriguez-Barranco et al., 2013). However, there has
been little research into the effects of prenatal Mn exposure on birth
outcomes, and conflicting findings have been published on the asso-
ciation with birth size and gestational age (
Röllin et al., 2014; Tsai
et al., 2015; Vigeh et al., 2008; Zota et al., 2009
). Likewise, there has
been scant investigation of the effects on fetal growth of excessive Cr
levels during pregnancy; however, two recent studies associated higher
maternal Cr exposure with increased risk of LBW (
Xia et al., 2016) and
preterm delivery (
Pan et al., 2017).
As, Pb, and Hg can readily pass through the placental barrier from
the maternal bloodstream into the fetal circulation (Iyengar and Rapp,
), as is also the case for Mn (Krachler et al., 1999) and Cr (Ziaee
2001
et al., 2007
), while the placenta is only a partial barrier to the transfer
of Cd (
Esteban-Vasallo et al., 2012). Once they have reached the pla-
centa, these metallic/metalloid elements may interfere with placental
transport systems and enzymes, affecting the normal placental function
(Esteban-Vasallo et al., 2012). Thus, given the role of the placenta as a
mediator in the transfer of nutrients and contaminants to the fetus,
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health 222 (2019) 468—478
placental biomarkers may provide valuable information on intrauterine
exposure to these potentially toxic elements. Moreover, the placenta is
readily available and provides information on the exposure of both
mother and fetus (Esteban-Vasallo et al., 2012). However, few studies
have used the placenta to assess prenatal exposure to metals such as As,
Hg, or Mn in relation to birth outcomes (
A1-Saleh et al., 2014, 2015;
Esteban-Vasallo et al., 2012).
Previous data from the INMA — INfancia y Medio Ambiente
[Environment and Childhood] Project, a birth cohort study in Spain,
showed that total Hg level in cord blood from > 1800 newborns was
inversely associated with placental weight and head circumference but
not with the length of gestation (Murcia et al., 2016). Cord blood total
Hg was also associated with a reduced biparietal diameter at 12 weeks
of pregnancy (Ballester et al., 2018). With the above background, this
study aimed to examine the association of placental As, Cd, Pb, Hg, Mn,
and Cr concentrations with birth weight and length, head cir-
cumference, LBW, gestational age at birth, preterm delivery, and SGA in
a sub-sample of mother-child pairs from the INMA Project. There is
increasing evidence that the sex of the newborn may modify the asso-
ciation of prenatal exposure to toxic metals with birth outcomes
Kippler et al., 2012b, 2012b; Lamichhane et al., 2018; Wang et al.,
2017b; Xia et al., 2016) and subsequent neurodevelopmental effects
Llop et al., 2016). However, studies on the sex-specific effects of pre-
natal metal exposure on birth outcomes remain scarce, and their results
are controversial. Therefore, the potential role of sex as modifier of the
studied associations was also evaluated.
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
The INMA Project is a multicenter population-based cohort study
designed to investigate the effect of environmental exposures and diet
during pregnancy on fetal and child development (http://www.
proyectoinma.org). The study is composed of seven mother-child co-
horts established in different geographic areas of Spain (Guxens et al.,
). A total of 490 placentas (approximately one out of six births)
2012
were randomly collected at delivery from five of the INMA cohorts, i.e. :
Asturias, Gipuzkoa (Basque Country), Granada (Andalusia), Sabadell
(Catalonia), and Valencia, from 2000 through 2008. Participants were
recruited during the first prenatal visit (10—13 weeks of gestation)
(2003—2008) in Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and Valencia but at birth
in Granada (2000—2002), with a total of 3294 babies born to women in
these cohorts. All cohorts included male and female newborns except
for Granada, which recruited only male newborns. The details of the
INMA Project, including methods of recruitment and enrollment, have
been previously reported (Guxens et al., 2012). Out of the 490 placentas
collected, 366 (75%) were randomly selected for metal content ana-
lysis. The present study included 327 mother-infant pairs with available
data on placental metal levels, anthropometrical measures, gestational
age at birth, and relevant covariates. Information on head cir-
cumference was only available for 293 newborns. All procedures as-
sociated with the INMA study were approved by the institutional re-
view boards of the participating centers.
2.2. Laboratory analysis
The processing of placentas and the analytical and quality control
procedures used to determine metal concentrations are reported else-
where (
Amaya et al., 2013; Gil et al., 2006
). Briefly, half of the placenta
(including maternal and fetal sides as well as central and peripheral
parts) was homogenized to ensure homogeneity of the placental tissue.
Cd, Pb, Mn, and Cr concentrations in placenta homogenates were de-
termined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry, using an
AAnalyst 800 Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (Perkin—Elmer, Nor-
walk, CT) equipped with Zeeman background correction system and
469


C. Freire et al.
AS-800 auto-sampler. Total As content was determined in a hydride
generation atomic absorption spectrometer (Perkin—Elmer FIAS-IOO)
and total Hg content in a Perkin—Elmer 560 Atomic Absorption Spec-
trometer equipped with Power Supply Lamp System and MHS-IO
Mercury Hydride System. Placental metal levels were expressed as ng
per g of placenta tissue (wet weight). Limits of detection (LD) were
0.004 ng/g for As, 0.235 ng/g for Cd, 0.016 ng/g for Hg, 6.500 ng/g for
Pb, 0.940 ng/g for Mn, and 1.488 ng/g for Cr. Certified Reference
Material for whole blood (two levels, ref. 201505 and 201605) were
supplied freeze-dried by Seronorm (Billingstad, Norway) and recon-
stituted by adding 5 mL of water (Table Sl).
2.3. Birth outcomes
Data on neonatal anthropometric measurements (birth weight in g
and birth length and head circumference in cm) were obtained by the
attending midwife or nurse. Gestational age was calculated as the
number of weeks from the self-reported last menstrual period to the end
of pregnancy. In Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and Valencia cohorts,
early fetal crown—rump length measurement by ultrasound was used to
correct gestational age when the two estimations differed by 7 days or
Murcia et al., 2016). LBW was defined by a birth weight of
more (12%) (
less than 2500 gat term, and preterm birth by live birth before 37
weeks of pregnancy. Newborns were defined as SGA when below the
10th percentile of the expected weight according to the Spanish birth
weight curve adjusted for gestational age and sex (Carrascosa et al.,
2008)
2.4. Confounding variables
Socio-demographics and lifestyle data were collected by inter-
viewer-administered questionnaires during the 1st and 3rd trimesters of
pregnancy (Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and Valencia cohorts) or at
the birth (Granada cohort). Information on the type of delivery (ce-
sarean or vaginal) was obtained from clinical records. Variables con-
sidered as potential confounders in this study were: newborn sex; co-
hort; maternal age; maternal and father's education level at delivery
(primary, secondary, or university schooling); maternal smoking during
pregnancy (yes or no); maternal working during pregnancy (yes or no);
pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI); parity (1, 2, or 23); and ma-
ternal place of residence during pregnancy (rural or urban/sub-urban).
Pre-pregnancy BMI was obtained by dividing self-reported pre-preg-
nancy weight in kg by the square of the current height and categorized
as underweight/normal weight (< 25.0 kg/m2) or overweight/obese
(225.0 kg/m2). Confounding assessment also included parental social
class, considering the higher-classified maternal or father's occupation
during the pregnancy. Social class was categorized as classes I + II
(higher classes), III (other non-manual classes), or IV + V (manual
classes). Additionally, the average of mean daily intakes of fish and
seafood reported at 12 and 32 weeks of gestation, adjusted for total
caloric intake, was considered as the daily intake (in g/day) during the
pregnancy. Information on food intake frequency during pregnancy was
gathered from the women in the Asturias, Gipuzkoa, Sabadell, and
Valencia cohorts using a validated semiquantitative questionnaire of
101 food items (Vioque et al., 2006). Fish intake during pregnancy is
known to be a potential source of fetal exposure to toxic metals
(Herreros et al., 2008). However, fish is also a rich source of proteins,
vitamins, iron, and long-chain unsaturated fatty acids, and its intake
during pregnancy might protect against metal toxicity and adverse birth
outcomes (Murcia et al., 2016; Olsen and Secher, 2002)
2.5. Statistical analysis
Concentrations of As, Hg, and Pb were below the LD in a high
proportion of samples. Therefore, we did not impute values < LD of
the assays for placental levels of these metals, and they were
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health 222 (2019) 468—478
categorized as detected or undetected. Cd concentrations < LD (1.8%
of placentas) were assigned a value one-half of the LD. Descriptive data
on placental metal content are shown as detection frequencies, median
values, and 25th and 75th percentiles of concentrations. Spearman's
correlation test was used to assess relationships between Cd, Mn, and Cr
levels. For birth outcomes, absolute and relative frequency, mean,
median, and 25th and 75th percentiles were used for descriptive pur-
poses. Associations of parental characteristics and newborn sex with
birth weight and length, gestational age, and SGA were examined by
univariate linear and logistic regression, and those showing an asso-
ciation at p < 0.20 entered a multivariate regression model to identify
predictors of each outcome. Variables were retained in the multivariate
model if associated at p < 0.10 with the outcome. The covariates as-
sociated with birth weight in the multivariate model were newborn sex,
maternal smoking or working during pregnancy, and pre-pregnancy
BMI; those associated with birth length were newborn sex and cohort;
and those associated with head circumference were newborn sex and
maternal smoking during pregnancy. Maternal education alone was a
significant predictor of gestational age, while the father's education,
maternal working during pregnancy, and the variable cohort remained
associated with SGA.
Adjusted linear regression models were created to assess the asso-
ciation of metal levels with anthropometric parameters and gestational
age at birth. Associations with binary outcomes (LBW, preterm de-
livery, and SGA) were explored by logistic regression. Models were
adjusted for outcome predictors and cohort and simultaneously ad-
justed for all metals. Because a reduction in gestation length is a major
determinant of birth weight, models with birth weight, LBW, birth
length, and head circumference were additionally adjusted for gesta-
tional age. The 10% change-in-estimate criterion was used to select
confounders for each outcome, retaining variables in the final model if
they modified the effect of metal level on outcome (b regression coef-
ficient) by > 10%. LBW and preterm delivery models were adjusted for
the same covariates as those included in birth weight and gestational
age models, respectively. Cd, Mn, and Cr concentrations showed
skewed distributions and were therefore transformed into natural
logarithms before regression analyses. Random effect models were used
to report final estimates from the main and sex-stratified analyses to
account for the heterogeneity among cohorts (Table 2 and
Table S3).
Estimates of models with Cd, Mn, and Cr and continuous outcomes are
reported as change in outcome for each 10% increase in metal level,
while results for logistic regression models are reported as the odds of
each outcome for every 10% increase in placental levels of Cd, Mn, or
Cr. All linear regression models were tested for multicollinearity by
variance inflation factor (VIF), using a cutoff of 3.5, and for outliers by
standardized residuals and for potential influential observations (Cook's
distance).
In order to explore nonlinear associations of metal levels with birth
weight and length, head circumference, and gestation age, further re-
gression analyses were conducted with Cd, Mn, and Cr categorized in
tertiles, and with Hg grouped as < LD, between LD and median de-
tected value, and above this median. The likelihood ratio test was
performed to test the significance of linear trends across tertiles/cate-
gories of metal levels. The effect modification by sex was evaluated by
interaction terms and stratified regression models. Generalized additive
models (GAMs) were also used to evaluate the linearity of the re-
lationships of Cd, Mn, and Cr with continuous outcomes, comparing
linear and nonlinear models by using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).
GAMs were fitted with the mgcv library of R, using penalized thin plate
regression splines as smoothing functions and the default basis di-
mension (k 10). In a final sensitivity analysis, associations with birth
size, LBW, and SGA were examined after excluding preterm births, and
the potential confounding of maternal fish intake was assessed in a sub-
sample of women with data available on dietary intake during preg-
nancy (N 217). R statistical software version 3.4.3 (fmsb, mtest, and
mgcv libraries) was used for the data analyses.

3. Results
No significant differences in characteristics
of study participants
were found between those included in the current study (N = 327) and
those with data on birth outcomes but not on placental metal levels or
relevant covariates (N 2811), with the exception of a higher per-
centage of children from Granada (32 vs 19%) and a lower percentage
of women residing in rural areas (17 vs 25%) and of women working
during pregnancy (76 vs 84%) in the included versus excluded children
(Supplementary material,
Table S2). Table 1 describes the character-
istics of parents and newborns in the study sample. Up to 29% of fathers
and 38% of mothers had primary schooling, while 42% of parents be-
longed to lower social classes. Among the mothers, 26% reported
having smoked during pregnancy, 76% worked throughout the preg-
nancy, 28% were overweight or obese before pregnancy, 14% gave
birth by cesarean section, 39% were primiparous, and only 4% were
over 40 years old at delivery. Nearly one-third of the newborns under
study were female. The mean birth weight, length, and head cir-
cumference were 3318 g, 50 cm, and 34.5cm, respectively. Mean ge-
stational age was 39.6 weeks. LBW was recorded in 3%, premature
birth in 2%, and SGA in 6% of the deliveries. None of the newborns had
a very LBW (< 1500 g) or was extremely preterm (< 32 weeks).
The non-essential metal found in the highest percentage of placentas
was Cd (98%), followed by Hg (62%), As (27%), and Pb (13%).
However, metal content varied among cohorts, with the women from
Valencia having higher As, Hg, and Cd levels; women from Sabadell
having higher Mn and Cr levels; and those from Granada having lower
As, Hg, and Cd levels but higher Pb levels (
). Mn was positively

correlated with both Cd (Spearman coefficient, r = 0.22; p < 0.001)
and Cr (r 0.34; p < 0.001), whereas no significant correlation was
found between Cd and Cr.
Multivariate regression analysis (Table 3) revealed that a 10% in-
crease in Cd levels were associated with 1.21 -fold increased odds
(95%C1 = 1.01; 1.43) of LBW but with a 9% lower risk (95%C1 0.84;
0.99) of preterm delivery. In addition, a weak and marginal association
was found between increased Cd level and reduced birth length
— —0.05; 0.00). Detected (vs. undetected) Hg levels
(-0.02 cm, 95%C1 -
were associated with a non-significant reduction in birth length
(-0.47cm, 95%C1 -
— —0.99; 0.05). In contrast, a 10% increase in
placental Mn and Cr, respectively, was associated with a slightly longer
gestational period (0.04 weeks, 95%CI 0.01; 0.07 for Mn and 0.02
weeks, 950/'0C1 0.00; 0.04 for cr) (see also GAM plots in Fig. 2) Re
gression analysis with categorized metal levels and continuous out-
) revealed a decrease of —111.8 g (95%CI =
comes (
Table 4
-215.2;
—8.06) in birth weight, a decrease of —0.62 cm (95%CI —1.20,
—0.04) in birth length, and an increase of 0.38 weeks (95%CI 0.00;
0.76) in gestational age for women with placental Cd levels in the
highest (vs. lowest) tertile, with the three outcomes showing significant
linear trends across Cd tertiles (see also Figs. 1 and 2). In comparison to
women with undetected placental Hg, those with low levels showed a
decrease of —0.63cm (95%CI —1.18; —0.08) in birth length, al-
though there was no evidence of a linear trend (Table 4). Placental Cr
was inversely associated with birth length, with a decrease of — 0.68 cm
— —1.33; —0.04) for women with Cr levels in the highest (vs.
(95%C1 -
lowest) tertile (p-trend = 0.02), whereas Cr levels in the middle and
highest tertile were associated, respectively, with an increase in ge-
stational age of 0.56 (95%C1 = 0.16; 0.97) and 0.35 (95%C1 -0.07;
0.77) weeks (p-trend = 0.08) (Table 4, Figs. 1 and 2). GAM analysis
suggested possible nonlinear relationships between Mn level and an-
thropometric parameters, finding a slight inverted U-shaped relation-
ship with birth weight and length (Fig. 1). However, linear models
showed lower AIC values, indicating no significant improvement in
nonlinear models. As and Pb were not associated with any of the birth
outcomes. No multicollinearity problems, outliers, or influential ob-
servations were detected in any model.
The sex-stratified analysis revealed that head circumference was
associated inversely with detected Hg (—0.49 cm, 95%CI —1.00
— 0.03) and positively with Mn (0.05 cm,
O. 03, Pinteraction ¯
— —0.01; 0.10 for 10% increased Mn, Pinteraction —

male newborns alone. There was also a significant association between
Cd and lower risk of preterm birth in male newborns alone (OR 0.86,
95%C1 0.78; 0.96 for increased Cd, 0.10). In addi-
tion, Mn and Cr were marginally and positively associated with gesta-
tional age in males (0.05 weeks, 95%CI 0.00; 0.09 for 10% increased
Mn and 0.02 weeks, 95%C1 0.00; 0.05 for increased cr), but no
statistically significant interactions were found.
Sensitivity analysis performed by excluding preterm births did not
show substantially different results (Tables S4 and S5) except for a
weakening of the associations of Cd and Cr with gestational age and an
apparent increasing trend in gestational age across Mn tertiles (
Table
S5). In models adjusted for maternal fish intake (N 217), inverse
associations of Cd with birth weight and length and of Cr with birth
length were strengthened (Tables S6 and S7), while there were sig-
nificant associations of Mn with increased birth weight and head cir-
cumference and of Cd with reduced head circumference (
Table S7).
Stratified analysis after excluding preterm births strengthened the po-
sitive association between Mn and gestational age in males (0.60 weeks,
95%C1 0.21; 0.98 for increased Mn, -
— 0.15), while
associations of gestational age with Cr and Cd in males lost statistical
significance. Models adjusted for maternal fish intake showed no sub-
stantial differences in the sex-stratified analysis. GAM analysis showed
no evidence of nonlinear relationships in sex-stratified models (data not
shown).

4. Discussion
In this multicenter cohort study, we found some adverse associa-
tions between placental metal concentrations and birth size.
Specifically, 1) Cd level was associated with reduced birth weight and
length in a linear manner, and with increasing odds of LBW in the
global sample; 2) placental Hg level was related to reduced head cir-
cumference in female newborns; and 3) Cr level was associated with
reduced birth length in the global sample. These associations were in-
dependent of gestational age or preterm birth, suggesting that exposure
to these metals influences fetal growth. Interestingly, Cd levels were
associated with a slight increase in gestational age and lower odds of
preterm delivery. There was also evidence of positive associations of
Mn with gestational age in males and with head circumference in fe-
males and of Cr with gestational age in the global sample.
The placental metal levels found in the INMA cohorts fall within the
low-intermediate range of previous reports, as already described
Amaya et al., 2013; Freire et al., 2018). Studies on placental bio-
markers of exposure to toxic metals in relation to birth outcomes have
published conflicting results (
A1-Saleh et al., 2014, 2015; Esteban-
Vasallo et al., 2012; Falc6n et al., 2003; Gundacker et al., 2010; Guo
et al., 2013; Kippler et al., 2010; Llanos and Ronco, 2009; Ronco et al.,
2005; Stasenko et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2004
). Thus, a large study
(N > 1500) in Saudi Arabia found that placental Hg levels were ne-
gatively associated with head circumference but not with birth weight
or length, and that placental Cd or Pb was not related to birth an-
thropometry (
). The mean placenta Hg, Cd,
A1-Saleh et al., 2014, 2015
and Pb levels in their population were several times higher than in our
study (Hg: 64 vs. 4.43 ng/g; Cd: 45 vs. 4.45 ng/g•, Pb: 579 vs. < 6.5 ng/
g, respectively). Studies in China (
Guo et al., 2013
) and in a small
sample (N 53) in Austria (Gundacker et al., 2010) observed no as-
sociation between placental Hg and birth weight, length, or head cir-
cumference, finding similar Hg levels as those in our population (3.58
and 1.9 ng/g, respectively, vs. 4.43 ng/g). In the Austrian study, how-
ever, placental Pb content, which was higher than in our study (25.8
vs. < 6.5 ng/g), was inversely related to birth weight and length but not
with gestational age (Gundacker et al., 2010). A Chilean study of 20
women reported higher placental As, Cd, and Pb levels in those
473
delivering LBW vs. normal-weight newborns (Llanos and Ronco, 2009)
while other studies indicated a relationship between placental Cd and
reduced birth weight (Kippler et al., 2010; Ronco et al., 2005; Stasenko
et al., 2010
), length (Stasenko et al., 2010), and chest circumference
(Kippler et al., 2010). In contrast, two small studies in China (Zhang
) and Spain (
Falc6n et al., 2003
) found no association of
et al., 2004
placental Cd and Pb levels, which were much higher than in the current
study, with birth weight, length, or head or abdominal circumference.
Other studies found no association between placental levels of Hg, Pb,
or Cd and birth outcomes (Esteban-Vasallo et al., 2012)
4.1. Cadmium
Because Cd accumulates in the placenta, higher Cd levels would be
expected in placentas from longer pregnancies. This may explain the
observed positive association with gestational age; however, this is not
supported by previous findings of no or inverse associations between
placental Cd and gestational age (Esteban-Vasallo et al., 2012; Falc6n
et al., 2003; Kippler et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2016), and the possibility
of residual confounding cannot be entirely ruled out. Despite its partial
retention in the placenta, Cd appeared to exert the most negative effect
on birth size in our study population, and placental Cd levels may be an
indicator of maternal smoking during pregnancy (
Ronco et al., 2005)
Accordingly, placental Cd content was significantly higher in the pre-
sent mothers who smoked during pregnancy than in those who did not
(median: 5.57 vs. 4.10 ng/g). Although studies using the placenta as
exposure matrix have reported varied results regarding Cd and birth

size (
Llanos and Ronco, 2009; Ronco et al., 2005; Stasenko et al., 2010;
Zhang et al., 2004
), our results are in agreement with the finding by
various large studies linking Cd levels in maternal blood, urine, or cord
blood to reduced birth weight (Johnston et al., 2014; Kippler et al.,
2012a•, Menai et al., 2012; sun et al., 2014
) and length (A1-Saleh et al.,
2015; Zhang et al., 2004
). However, in contrast to our finding, a recent
study of > 5000 Chinese women found that maternal urinary Cd levels
were not associated with birth size (Yang et al., 2016). Cd is known to
cause oxidative stress and placental Cd may interfere with the transfer
of Zn to the fetus (Kippler et al., 2010), which would likely have an

adverse effect on fetal growth. Cd may also reduce placental leptin and
progesterone synthesis and inhibit the migration of human trophoblast
cells (
Jacobo-Estrada et al., 2017; Stasenko et al., 2010). Cd has also
been identified as an endocrine disruptor, interfering with the estrogen
receptor (Kortenkamp, 2011). In vitro studies have shown that Cd re-
duces the expression of the placental enzyme llß-hydroxysteroid de-
hydrogenase type 2 (
). This enzyme protects the fetus
Yang et al., 2006
from high maternal glucocorticoid levels, which may lead to fetal
growth restriction, and female fetuses have been shown to be more
sensitive than male fetuses to increased glucocorticoid levels (Murphy
). In this line,
Kippier et al. (2012a, 2012b)
reported that
et al., 2006
prenatal Cd exposure in Bangladesh was negatively related to birth
weight and head circumference in females alone, and that the asso-
ciation with fetal size was stronger for the females. Our results do not
support previously published findings of sex-specific effects of Cd on
birth size, and this issue requires further research.
4.2. Arsenic
Exposure to high naturally occurring levels of As in drinking water
has been associated with adverse birth outcomes, especially a sig-
nificant reduction in birth weight (Laine et al., 2015; Milton et al.,
2017; Quansah et al., 2015; Rahman et al., 2018). Several recent studies
in the US have corroborated the association of prenatal As exposure as
measured by drinking water concentration (inorganic As) and maternal
levels (total As), with reduced birth weight at lower levels of exposure
(Almberg et al., 2017; Claus Henn et al., 2016; Gilbert-Diamond et al.,
), while some evidence, although still inconsistent, has suggested
2016
that relatively lower levels of maternal total As are also related to re-
duced head circumference (Claus Henn et al., 2016; Gilbert-Diamond
et al., 2016
). In the present study, placental total As level was not re-
lated to birth size or gestational age, probably due to low levels of
exposure, especially in the Granada cohort, and the fact that As ex-
posure in our population was mostly from fish in which As is largely
found in its less toxic organic form (
Fort et al., 2014)
4.3. Mercury
Conflicting results have been published on the relationship between
birth outcomes and total Hg levels measured in cord blood or in ma-
ternal hair or blood. Some authors have reported a relationship with
reduced birth size (A1-Saleh et al., 2014; Gundacker et al., 2010; Murcia
et al., 2016; Vigeh et al., 2018; wells et al., 2016
) and premature
delivery (
Xue et al., 2007
), whereas others found no association with
birth anthropometry (Bashore et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2013; Drouillet-
Pinard et al., 2010; Karagas et al., 2012) or gestation length (
Bashore
et al., 2014; Drouillet-Pinard et al., 2010; Murcia et al., 2016; Wells
et al., 2016
). Studies of placental Hg levels have also yielded contra-
dictory results (A1-Saleh et al., 2014, 2015; Esteban-Vasallo et al.,
). The present study provides evidence of a negative effect of
2012
placental Hg on head circumference in females and suggests that the
apparent negative effect on birth length is confounded by maternal fish
intake, as previously observed in relation to cord blood Hg in the INMA
study (
Murcia et al., 2016). Some previous studies have reported a
negative association of prenatal Hg exposure with head circumference
(A1-Saleh et al., 2014; Murcia et al., 2016). Cord blood total Hg levels in
four of the present INMA cohorts were also associated with reduced
head circumference, independently of maternal fish intake, but no
difference was observed between the sexes (Murcia et al., 2016). It is
noteworthy that a high proportion of the INMA cord blood samples had
elevated levels of total Hg, which were influenced by maternal intake of
large oily fish (
), and were positively correlated with
Llop et al., 2012
placental Hg levels (data not shown). Discrepancies between findings
from INMA and other studies may be attributable to differences in
sample sizes, exposure biomarkers, degree of Hg exposure, or to the
lack of adjustments for maternal fish intake and other relevant con-
founders, among other factors.
The negative association observed between Hg and head cir-
cumference in females is consistent with the finding by our previous
investigation of a negative relationship between cord blood Hg and
psychomotor development at 1 year of age in females alone (Llop et al.,
), given that birth head circumference may be linked to subsequent
2012
cognitive development. Methyl-Hg has been found to induce oxidative
Caballero et al., 2017; Jauniaux et al., 2006), which may con-
stress (
tribute to the effects of Hg on impaired fetal growth. However, further
research is required to elucidate the biological mechanism underlying
the sex-specific association observed between Hg exposure and birth
size.
4.4. Lead
Prenatal Pb exposure is known to affect embryonic development
and is associated with several adverse outcomes from infancy through
adolescence. It has been postulated that even low-level Pb exposure
may impair infant growth and development (Bellinger, 2008
). How-
ever, a review in 2008 described the epidemiological evidence for an
475


C. Freire et al.
association of in utero Pb exposure with fetal growth and preterm birth
as limited (
Wigle et al., 2008
). Since then, several studies in populations
with different levels of exposure (mostly measured in maternal blood)
have reported adverse associations of Pb levels with birth weight,
length and head circumference, gestational age, LBW, SGA, and pre-
term delivery (
Gundacker et al., 2010; Lamichhane et al., 2018;
Rodosthenous et al., 2017; Taylor et al., 2015; Vigeh et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2017a; zhu et al., 2010
). Placental Pb content was low in the
present population, especially in younger cohorts, confirming previous
INMA findings of cord blood levels several times lower than the
threshold established by the World Health Organization (Llop et al.,
). In fact, among women with data available on placental and cord
2011
blood Pb (N = 219), 95% of those with placental Pb levels below the LD
had undetected cord blood Pb. As in the case of As, the low placental Pb
levels in our study population may explain the apparent lack of an
adverse association between Pb and birth outcomes.
4.5. Manganese and chromium
Studies addressing prenatal exposure to Mn have shown varied re-
sults in relation to fetal growth and gestation length (
Röllin et al., 2014;
Tsai et al., 2015; Vigeh et al., 2008; Zota et al., 2009
), with some ex-
perimental studies finding reduced fetal weight in pregnant mice ex-
posed to Mn (Colomina et al., 1996; Sanchez et al., 1993). In the present
study, there was a positive effect of Mn on gestational age and an ap-
parent sex-specific effect on increased head circumference, which re-
mains unclear and warrants further investigation. Mn is involved in the
functioning of numerous organ systems and is needed for immune
function, digestion, and bone growth, but excessive Mn exposure is
considered harmful to the fetus (Aschner and Aschner, 2005). However,
present results do not appear to support the hypothesis that fetal
growth is favored by lower Mn levels but impaired by elevated levels, in
disagreement with the finding by
of an inverse U-
Zota et al. (2009)
shaped relationship between maternal blood Mn and birth weight.
Higher urinary Cr levels in Chinese pregnant women from the
general population were associated with an increased risk of LBW in a
case-control study (
Xia et al., 2016
) and with shorter gestation length
and greater risk of preterm delivery in a large (N > 7000) cohort study
(Pan et al., 2017
), and these associations seemed to be modified by the
sex of the newborn (Pan et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2016). In contrast, cord
blood Cr levels were not associated with newborns' birth size in a recent
study conducted in a non-industrialized island in the Canary archipe-
Iago, Spain (Cabrera-Rodriguez et al., 2018). Although the toxicity of Cr
is mainly attributable to the hexavalent form (Cr+ 6), excessive triva-
lent Cr (Cr + 3), which is the biologically active form of Cr, may also be
hazardous for health. As in the Chinese studies (
Pan et al., 2017; Xia
et al., 2016
), total Cr levels were recorded in the present investigation
but our results do not support their conclusions, because we found that
elevated Cr levels were associated with reduced birth length but longer
gestation. The lack of adverse association found in our study between
Cr and other anthropometrical parameters or gestational age may
possibly be due to the low levels of exposure to Cr (Cr + 3 and Cr+ 6) in
our study population, as also observed in the Canary islands (Cabrera-
Rodriguez et al., 2018).
4.6. Strengths and limitations
Major strengths of the present study include the relatively large
number of participants in comparison to previous studies on placental
metal levels, the adjustment for several confounders, the performance
of sensitivity analysis (sex-stratified analysis, adjustment for fish intake,
and exclusion of preterm births), and the use of the placenta as ex-
posure matrix. In addition, this is one of the few studies to examine Mn
and Cr in relation to birth outcomes. Given the accumulation of metals
such as Cd in the placenta during pregnancy, it offers a singular op-
portunity to assess chronic maternal exposure to toxic chemicals,
International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health 222 (2019) 468—478
avoiding the need for repeated maternal blood or urinary sampling
(Esteban and Castafio, 2009). Nonetheless, the relationship between
this measurement and exposure at critical times during pregnancy re-
mains unknown. Our study is also limited by the fact that genders were
not equally distributed (the Granada cohort recruited only boys);
therefore, sex-specific associations should be interpreted with caution.
It should also be taken into account that some significant associations
observed could result from chance because multiple analyses were
performed. However, some of the statistically significant associations
found were in line with the literature and seem unlikely to be the result
of chance or residual confounding, particularly the dose-response re-
lationships observed for Cd and Mn in relation to birth size. Further-
more, the low numbers of LBW, premature, and SGA newborns with
available data on placental metal levels likely reduced the precision of
our estimates. Finally, the measures of birth outcomes were recorded
according to each hospital protocol, and our findings may have been
subject to non-differential measurement error.
5. Conclusions
This study of Spanish mother-child pairs from the general popula-
tion found that in utero exposure to Cd and Cr, as measured by placental
levels, was associated with reduced birth size with no apparent sex-
specific effects, and that placental Hg was associated with reduced head
circumference in females. Although the magnitude of the estimated
effects is not necessarily clinically relevant for newborns, the ubiquity
of exposure to these metals, especially to Hg through fish intake, re-
presents an important public health issue. Furthermore, results ob-
tained suggest that Mn exposure may have a beneficial effect on ge-
station length and female head circumference and that Cr may also
have a positive impact on gestational length, but further investigation is
required to verify this possible effect. Larger prospective studies are
also needed to confirm the adverse associations observed and to iden-
tify developmental windows of particular susceptibility to potentially
toxic metals.

Abstract— In 2015, Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) was still
high especially in Indonesian. It had strong a correlation in
Millenium Development Goals to achieve the better quality of
human life. Surprisingly, most of maternal mortality case is
usually preventable with good quality of knowledge. In this day,
the use of social media has been increasing. In 2016, social media
has been using by 2,34 billion people worldwide and the sixth
highest number of internet user comes from Indonesia. Besides
that, pregnant women have a tendency to use social media for
seeking out about health information during pregnancy in
prenatal, perinatal and postnatal also reproductive health topics.
We created Jakpros application, a smart mobile application who
designed for women. The purpose of it is for serving better health
service and reliable information. Our aim in this study is to
analyze how the educational page in Jakpros application can
increase pregnant women knowledge. We recruited 126 pregnant
women participant from 9 several sub-district hospitals in
Jakarta. We detected their knowledge of reproductive health in
pre-test questionnaire about basic pregnancy. After that, we
guided them to download Jakpros application on their mobile
phone. We asked them to use it in 2 weeks, and we were seeing
their knowledge in post-test. The observational analytics study was
using cross-sectional and analyzed by SPSS 24 to see the
differences in knowledge. Their knowledge has been increasing
after they used the educational page feature in 2 weeks. Along with
this era, Jakpros application is an effective platform for making
pregnant women is more educable.

I. INTRODUCTION
Maternal mortality rate (MMR) in Indonesia was still high.
In 2015, we found out 126 mortality cases of 100.000 live births
[1]. As we knew, MMR is one of Millenium Goals Development
important indicator to achieve the better quality human life and
health in the world [2]. In 2030, the global target has a goal to
decrease MMR until less than 70 cases. To achieve the goals, we
have to know the main factor who plays an important role. The
past study showed that the pregnant women educational level is
correlated with their mortality and health status during
USAID-SHERA SMART CITY
pregnancy. Meanwhile, many of the mortality cases are actually
can be detected and prevented in the earlier stage at least one-
quarter until one-half cases. Indirectly, knowledgeable people is
more awareness and have a tendency for getting better health
than people who do not [3].
Social media has been using by 2.34 billion worldwide users
in 2016. The number is predicted to increase in 2020 [4]. In this
era, people have frequently used the internet for seeking out
information especially in young women. Related to it, pregnancy
is stressful moment and pregnant women had a tendency to use
the internet to get another experience and opinion [5]. We could
see that social media as an effective tool for giving knowledge
and as a platform for health promotion for preventing [4].
Pregnant women often to use it of convenience and the low-cost
effectiveness access. Furthermore, it makes many new invention
in making mobile health application who especially designed for
women [6].
In 2018, We created the Jakpros application: Jakarta
Reproduksi Sehat. Jakpros is a smart mobile health application
who designed for women. For making Jakpros application, it
needed framework who connect to build up a mobile hybrid
applications with HTML5, CSS, and AngularJS. Furthermore,
Web Browser was using for development and Google Chrome
to debug it. Currently, Jakpros application is only available in
Android. We can simply get it by download from Google-play
store and the cost is free. The purpose of the Jakpros application
is for giving our patient convenience in communicate and access
information. We would like to explain the feature in it. First, the
educational page is a feature to get reproductive health
information such as prenatal care, cervical cancer prevention,
high-risk pregnancy, and contraception knowledge. The
educational page display was a pictorial article and easy to read
with language that is understood by the patient. In this
application, we served information from the reliable obstetrician
and gynecologist doctor and the patient does not have to worried
about credibility. The second feature is the question and answers
forum by directly connecting the doctor and their patient. In the
past study, we found out that patient would like to ask about their
symptoms quickly and did not have to go to the doctor because
of they lazy or shy to do it. They would be happy to get

III. RESULTS
One hundred and sixty-six pregnant women from several
Sub-District Public Hospital in Jakarta assessed to this study.
For the beginning, 31 participants who did not require the
criteria were exclusion. We conducted 135 participants who
assessed to this study. After that, they signed in the informed
consent and answered a pre-test questionnaire. In the next days,
after 2 weeks they used this application, we collected them to fill
out the post-test questionnaire and 9 participants were drop out
of in this study. Our total sampling was 126 participants. There
were no specific follow up in this study. In table I, we could see
the study was dominated by women in 26-35 years old (58%).
Most of the participant educational level was college and above
(49%), had islam religion (89%), housewife (56%) and married
women (100%). We conducted 10 questions in multiple-choice
answer consisted of anemia, nutrition, and high pregnancy. In
this paper, we showed you the right answer and their answered
(Table II). In the first question, we asked "What is anemia
means? " this purpose of this question was to detect their basic
knowledge in it. Most of the participants did not know the
definition of anemia. In the the pre-test, around 70.9% of them
answered anemia as decreased of red blood cells and 34.7%
participants answered anemia as decreased of hemoglobin. In
the post-test, there was an increase in the hemoglobin answer
(36.7%). Second question was about "How much calcium needs
during pregnancy? ", most of them answered that need 1000 mg
per day calcium each day. The right question was answered by
54.5% in pre-test and 55.1% in post-test. We asked the benefit
of amino acid for the third question. We knew the answer was
for fetal brain development and most of them answer it correctly
in 77.8% to 80.5%. Fourth, 64.6% participant answered that
pregnant women need 3000 mg/day calories in 20 weeks of
pregnancy, the pre-test was just 52.8% answered for the right.
Even though they did not know in anemia definition, they
understood hemoglobin as an important role for hemoglobin
formation (Pre-test was 86.9 and post-test was 89.8%). After the
antenatal care question, then we asked high-risk pregnancy
question. Most of them answer right answer since the pre-test
and has been increasing in the post-test. We found out increased
rate was 3.7% from 70.5% to 74.2% in the post-test for high-risk
pregnancy early sign. Furthermore, in the pre-test 46.5%
participant answered seizure as the sign of eclampsia and it was
significantly changed in post-test around 60.9%. Then, they
could recognize that weight gain during pregnancy more than I
kg in one week was abnormal. We have seen an increased rate
from 55.3% to 59.8%. Dyspnea was a sign in heart disease
answered by 82.7% in the pre-test and 89.0% in post-test. For
the last question, there were increased in 6.2% answer for the
placenta previa sign.
In Table III, we used Wilcoxon test and see the overall
difference of the pre and post test (P < 0,05 was statistically
significant). We focused to analyze the correlation between their
score in educational level and job (Figure III, I V) with Kruskal
Wallis test.

ofdisease and will lead them to right decision. Furthermore, they
would do antenatal care regularly and keep their lifestyle to
prevent unwanted things [8].
We found out people with a higher education background
and had other jobs (e.g. entrepreneur and freelancer) were
having a better in basic reproductive knowledge. In the past
study was shown that people with higher education have a
tendency to get better knowledge due to experience and ease of
access [9]. Therefore, there was still an increase in other
educational background and other jobs after using it in daily.
In our study, we could not judge yet that knowledge would
change their behavior too. Two weeks periods of this study
cannot explain in more detail about it. Overmore, lack of follow
up and do they read from other sources are our limitation in this
study. However, we found out that pregnant women knowledge
could be increased through the educational page feature in
Jakpros application.
CONCLUSION
We found the educational page feature in Jakpros mobile
health application had the positive benefit in serving
reproductive health knowledge. In addition, knowledge could
make pregnant women more aware of their condition during
pregnancy and be able to prevent unwanted things. Jakpros
application is helping the doctor to spread reliable information.
The further study is needed to see do the changes in knowledge
will be followed by changes in behavior. In the next day, we
hope Jakpros application will reveal and contribute for
decreasing Indonesian Maternal Mortality Rate.

knowledge even though did not significantly. The previous
study found that reproduction health knowledge was used as a
first step to decrease the maternal mortality rate. Besides that,
among the other factor, knowledge is the easiest way to
implement in daily [7]. Health information availability could

The reduction of maternal mortality and the promotion of maternal health and wellbeing are complex tasks. This
Series paper analyses the distal and proximal determinants of maternal health, as well as the exposures, risk factors,
and micro-correlates related to maternal mortality. This paper also examines the relationship between these
determinants and the gradual shift over time from a pattern of high maternal mortality to a pattern of low maternal
mortality (a phenomenon described as the maternal mortality transition). We conducted two systematic reviews of the
literature and we analysed publicly available data on indicators related to the Sustainable Development Goals,
specifically, estimates prepared by international organisations, including the UN and the World Bank. We considered
23 frameworks depicting maternal health and wellbeing as a multifactorial process, with superdeterminants that
broadly affect women's health and wellbeing before, during, and after pregnancy. We explore the role of social
determinants of maternal health, individual characteristics, and health-system features in the production of maternal
health and wellbeing. This paper argues that the preventable deaths of millions of women each decade are not solely
due to biomedical complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period, but are also tangible manifestations
of the prevailing determinants of maternal health and persistent inequities in global health and socioeconomic
development. This paper underscores the need for broader, multipronged actions to improve maternal health and
wellbeing and accelerate sustainable reductions in maternal mortality. For women who have pregnancy, childbirth, or
postpartum complications, the health system provides a crucial opportunity to interrupt the chain of events that can
potentially end in maternal death. Ultimately, expanding the health sector ecosystem to mitigate maternal health
determinants and tailoring the configuration of health systems to counter the detrimental effects of eco-social forces,
including though increased access to quality-assured commodities and services, are essential to improve maternal
health and wellbeing and reduce maternal mortality.
Introduction
In 2015, world leaders committed to promoting peace,
prosperity, health, and global cooperation to ensure
the sustainability of human civilisation by setting
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).1 However,
emerging priorities, such as the COVID-19 pandemic
with its evolving consequences, the pressing climate
emergency, conflicts, and political instabilities, have
competed for attention and resources.2-; In this context,
previous and persistent challenges, such as maternal
mortality, risk being neglected.56 At the halfway mark to
2030, the goal of reaching a global maternal mortality ratio
(MMR) of 70 maternal deaths per 100000 livebirths
remains elusive, with 223 maternal deaths per 100 000 live-
births reported in 2020. This figure is much less than the
MMR for 2000, which was 339 maternal deaths per
100000 livebirths. However, since 2016, the MMR has
decreased in only two regions: central and south Asia, and
Australia and New Zealand. Sub-Saharan Africa, Oceania
(excluding Australia and New Zealand), east and southeast
Asia, and north Africa all experienced a stagnation in the
MMR. During this time period, the MMR increased in
Europe, North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. 6
The reported stagnation in global MMR is an urgent
matter: an estimated 287 000 women died from causes
www.thelancet.com/lancetgh Vol 12 February 2024
related to pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum
period in 2020 alone.6 The preventable loss of almost
3 million lives of women between 2010 and 2020 is not
only a global tragedy, but also an indicator of gross health
inequality between and within countries and a flagrant
human rights violation.7S Despite the large gains made in
many countries in terms of improved agency, education,
employment, and fertility desires for women, these
advances have not been universal—most maternal
deaths remain preventable and are largely clustered
among groups of socioeconomically disadvantaged
women. Disease outbreaks, conflicts, and other public
health emergencies aggravate the situation by increasing
the risk of pregnancy complications, disrupting health
systems, and posing additional constraints to maternal
and perinatal healthcare.9
The most common approach to tackling maternal
mortality by the global community has been to direct
investments to address the leading biomedical causes of
maternal death, particularly during the perinatal period.
Compared with biomedical causes, less attention has been
paid to the underlying determinants of adverse pregnancy
and childbirth outcomes and how health systems could be
configured to implement effective interventions and
mitigate the adverse effects of social factors on maternal

Key messages
Maternal health is a social issue: maternal ill-health and disability are not just medical
problems, but outcomes of a complex interplay of eco-social forces, lifestyles and
exposures, and individual-level factors
Focusing solely on biomedical causes of maternal mortality is insufficient, and has
possibly been the cause of many countries remaining at the same maternal mortality
transition stage for decades (121 out of 185 countries analysed have been in the same
maternal mortalitytransition stage for 20 years)
Addressing maternal health issues and reducing maternal mortality are complex
endeavours, due to both modifiable and unmodifiable factors that affect outcomes;
a broad, multipronged approach, including promotion of social development and
gender equality at national level, will be necessary to tackle determinants that act
upstream in the chain of events that leads to severe morbidity and death
The health sector has a crucial role in saving the lives of women with pregnancy,
labour, or postpartum complications, and should be expanded to mitigate the
detrimental effects of maternal health determinants
Expanding demand for and access to high-quality reproductive health services and
commodities (including safe abortion, modern contraception, and antenatal,
intrapartum, and postpartum care) are needed for primary prevention, early
identification, and adequate management of pregnancy, labour, and postpartum
complications
Achieving universal health coverage is essential to ensure access to quality care during
pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, and to reduce maternal mortality

health. Although pre-existing medical conditions (eg,
chronic anaemia, chronic hypertension, diabetes) are a
growing concern, direct obstetric complications (such as
postpartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, and infection)
remain the leading biomedical causes of maternal
mortality.10 The necessary technologies, commodities, and
services to effectively reduce maternal mortality already
exist. Mortality could be substantially reduced if quality-
assured maternal health commodities and services were
consistently available, and if unwanted pregnancies were
prevented in the first place by increasing access to modern
contraception.
However, an exclusive focus on maternal mortality
could be restrictive because surviving pregnancy is no
longer suffcient to achieve the global targets related to
maternal health.13-16 Beyond survival, the focus in
maternal health is evolving, towards promoting health
and wellbeing across the life course. This expanded focus
requires a holistic and integrative approach, centred on a
positive experience of care.w16 The integrative efforts
towards the SDGs are intentionally designed to converge
and align with this broader vision for maternal health—a
world in which all women have the highest possible level
of health and wellbeing during pregnancy and beyond.
Therefore, a rapid acceleration of global efforts to
improve maternal health is required if the SDG targets
are to be met by 2030, and the promise ofa better world
for all is to be realised.617
For this first paper in the Series on maternal health in
the perinatal period and beyond, we conducted a
systematic analysis of the determinants of maternal
health and factors associated with maternal mortality, and
examined the relationship between these determinants
and the gradual shift over time from a pattern of high
maternal mortality to a pattern of low maternal mortality,
a phenomenon described as the obstetric transition or
maternal mortality transition. 1819 The appendix presents
the methods used in this analysis, together with additional
information. Our aim was to provide a broad, overarching
conceptualisation of distal and proximal determinants
that shape maternal health outcomes, to enable an
informed reflection on the appropriate strategies to
accelerate countries' transition from high to low maternal
mortality burden stages. We hope this paper—together
with the other papers in the Series on vulnerability during
pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period,20
neglected medium-term and long-term complications
following labour and childbirth,21 and an intersectional
approach to address maternal health inequities22—
highlights often overlooked, yet crucial, pathways to
accelerate progress to end preventable maternal deaths
and improve maternal health and wellbeing. In this
paper, the terms "woman" and "women" are used to
reflect all populations with the reproductive capacity for
pregnancy and birth, including transgender and gender-
diverse people, as well as adolescent girls.
Maternal health as the product of a
multifactorial process
We reviewed the literature for conceptual frameworks of
the determinants of maternal health (appendix p 3). We
identified 23 frameworks portraying maternal health and
wellbeing as the result ofa multifactorial process (appendix
p 5). The core themes or elements commonly found in the
included frameworks are summarised in the figure. This
figure presents a high-level illustration of a health
production process, in which eco-social forces (ie, elements
of the superdeterminants and social determinants
described in the next section) and contexts, as well as
individual-level factors and lifestyle patterns, substantially
contribute to maternal health and wellbeing. The panel
lists the core themes we identified, informed by our
multisource literature review; it maps the factors associated
with maternal mortality and severe morbidity (appendix
p 8). In the following sections, we use the factors identified
from this literature review to further describe and elaborate
on the connections and interdependencies of the key
forces illustrated in the figure.
Superdeterminants and social determinants of
maternal health
The superdeterminants of maternal health are the
underlying contexts and forces that broadly influence
the health and wellbeing of women before, during,
and after pregnancy.24 These mutually interacting
superdeterminants include the characteristics of the
biosphere (eg, climate, ecosystem), biological features of
the human species (eg, the endocrinology of human
wwvv.thelancet.com/lancetgh Vol 12 February 2024


parturition and the anatomy of the female pelvis), and
the economic, political, and cultural bases of societies
(eg, health insurance policies and health budgetary
allocations, health-care policies and legislations on
reproductive rights and access to care, societal norms
and expectations related to gender roles and cultural
beliefs surrounding pregnancy and childbirth).25-34 The
evolution of modern humans, Homo sapiens, has largely
been shaped by the characteristics of the environment.
This evolution is an ongoing process driven by natural
selection and other mechanisms, in which traits and
characteristics that offer advantages for survival and
reproduction become sustained in populations over
time.35 Characteristics, such as the shape of the female
pelvis and the complex endocrinology of human
parturition, which underlie the biological and
physiological bases of pregnancy, labour, and childbirth,
are responsible for reproductive success (as well as
challenges) that persist across generations .28-33 Adaptation
to different environmental challenges over time
encouraged the development of social structures and
cooperative behaviours, culminating in a diverse range of
cultural practices, social norms, political structures, and
economies across different contexts.36'37 As the dominant
species on the planet, the activities of humans over time,
such as deforestation, industrialisation, and pollution,
have had profound effects on the environment. These
behaviours have led to disruptions in ecosystems, loss of
biodiversity, escalating and more frequent climate events
(such as heat waves, droughts, and floods), and the
emergence of new health threats, including zoonotic
diseases (eg, COVID-19), all with detrimental effects on
maternal survival and wellbeing.25 Although applicable
to other health areas, the combination of intrinsic
biological and behavioural characteristics of human
beings, the manifestations of human interactions with
the environment, and society's cultural, political, and
economic adaptations are superdeterminants with
substantial effects on maternal and perinatal health.24
The social determinants of health are derived from
economic, political, and cultural superdeterminants, and
are defined as the non-biomedical factors that influence
health risks and outcomes throughout life.34 With regard
to maternal health, social determinants of health are the
conditions in which women are born, grow, work, and live
before pregnancy, and during pregnancy, childbirth, and
the postpartum period. These social determinants
substantially affect maternal health outcomes, and are
indirectly responsible for the disparities observed in
maternal mortality and morbidity rates between different
populations. The list of social determinants of maternal
health in the literature is extensive, but the importance
of structural biases related to gender, ethnicity, and
socioeconomic class cannot be overemphasised.34A2A3
Gender disparities, income, education, ethnicity, and
race are strong predictors of death and disability

Figure: Maternal health production process
The diagram illustrates the relationships and interdependencies of
superdeterminants, showing how the characteristics of the planet shape biological
and physiological evolution of reproduction in human species (Homo sapiens), and
how continual adaptations of humans to the planet culminate into cultural
practices, social norms, and political and economic systems, that influence the
contexts in which pregnancy and childbirth takes place (social determinants), as
well as the individual-level traits, lifestyle patterns, and exposures to external
agents. The resultant effect of these forces on maternal health and wellbeing
depends on the efficiency of the health system at neutralising detrimental forces
and enhancing beneficial ones. In this representation, exposures and lifestyles are
influenced both by individual factors and social determinants. The performance of
the health system is also dependent on superdeterminants and influenced by
individual-level factors and social determinants.
beyond.42-4 Discrimination, systemic bias, and social
injustice are frequently associated with poor maternal
outcomes for racial and ethnic minority women; for
instance, a health-care system that routinely minimises
the pain reported by Black women is more likely to miss
warning signs for severe morbidity.42'43 Apart from the
direct effects of exposure to conflicts and other forms
of violence on pregnant women, conflict-induced
displacement and forced migration are recognised
disruptors of health-care systems and infrastructure,
restricting access to life-saving maternal health services,
and causing severe psychological stress and trauma for
pregnant and postnatal women.4547 Women who are
migrants and pregnant have to navigate several barriers to
access care in host countries, such as language, immigrant
status, and unfamiliarity with health-care systems. 46'47

women older than 35 years are associated with an
increased risk of some complications, such as pre-
eclampsia. 4849 Women with pre-existing conditions, such
as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease, and obesity,
are at a higher risk of dying during pregnancy,
childbirth, and the postpartum period than those
who do not have pre-existing conditions. Genetic
disorders, such as haemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle-cell
anaemia, thalassaemia major), haemophilia, hereditary
thrombophilia, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, can
increase the risk of maternal complications and
potentially lead to death.50-53 Exposure to environmental

affect the interval between the onset of obstetric complication and its outcome"
accidents resulting in physical trauma and injuries have
varying degrees of detrimental effects on maternal
health outcomes, depending on a woman's unique
circumstances and level of exposures. Violence against
women deserves special mention: although violence is
often more visible in conflict-affected areas, the effects
on pregnancy outcomes are equally devastating even in
non-conflict areas, particularly when perpetrated by an
intimate partner.SU7 As a result of the influence of
superdeterminants of maternal health—particularly
cultural, political, and economic systems—individual-
level factors that are shaped by family and community
characteristics tend to give rise to lifestyle patterns,
which in turn mitigate or elevate the risk of dying or
having pregnancy-related ill-health. Examples of
lifestyle patterns with substantial effects on maternal
health include diet (eg, low iron and low calcium intakes
increase the risk of iron-deficiency anaemia and pre-
eclampsia, respectively), physical activity, substance use
and smoking, and sexual behaviours during pregnancy

Interplay between maternal health determinants and
the concept of embodi ment
The pregnant woman is at the centre of a dynamic
and multifaceted web of interactions between
superdeterminants,
social determinants, and her
individual-level factors, exposures, and lifestyle pattern.
These determinants operate at several levels and are
interconnected and inter-related, with each factor
continuously influencing and being influenced by others,
leading to a resultant effect that collectively shapes
maternal health outcomes throughout pregnancy,
childbirth, and the postpartum period. For example, the
climate and environment in which pregnant women live
can affect their health, both directly, by modifying their
individual level-factors and exposures, and indirectly, by
disrupting their social support structures and health
systems. Extreme weather events, poor air and water
quality, and exposure to pollutants can directly or indirectly
influence maternal health outcomes.6S-68 Cultural norms
surrounding pregnancy and childbirth shape maternal
health behaviours and health-care seeking practices, by
acting as modifiers of individual-level factors, such as age
to start a family, number of children to have, and to what
extent the partner is involved in care of the woman.69
Cultural factors also influence decisions on nutrition,
antenatal care practices, and childbirth practices. Societal
expectations and gender roles can affect pregnant women's
autonomy, access to education, resources, and health care,
and influence their decision-making power within their
households, as well as their ability to make decisions about
their own health, where they work, and what they do.70
Lifestyle patterns arising from social determinants can
influence individual-level factors by initiating or
exacerbating pre-existing conditions that have serious
effects on maternal health. For example, low-income
status can result in poor nutritional intake or unhealthy
dietary practices, and consequently increased risks of
pre-pregnancy deficiency anaemia or maternal obesity.
Maternal obesity can increase the risk of gestational
diabetes; and an unhealthy diet during pregnancy can
contribute to excessive maternal weight gain, leading to
various complications, including gestational diabetes.71
Similarly, unresolved anaemia during pregnancy has
detrimental effects on the growing fetus and predisposes
the pregnant woman to adverse outcomes, including
postpartum haemorrhage and death.72
Lifestyle pattern and the health-care system can also
affect the interaction of factors, and converge as a net
force that influences overall maternal outcomes. However,
lifestyles and the configuration ofa health system are also
products of the prevailing context and social forces; the
capacity and resilience of a health system reflect the state
of social development. Intersections between factors,
particularly gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class,
www.thelancet.com/lancetgh Vol 12 February 2024
Series
are highly relevant in determining inequities in income
(affecting the quality of care a woman can access),
education (affecting how informed a woman is about her
choices during pregnancy and childbirth), and personal
agency (affecting how able a woman is to advocate for
her needs).22
Thus, this complex interplay of forces might produce
concrete events that substantially disrupt maternal
physical and mental health. For example, take a woman
born and raised in poverty with little access to education,
income, good nutrition, and family planning methods.
At an older age, as a multiparous pregnant woman with
nutritional anaemia, she faces severe bleeding after
giving birth to a stillborn baby. Despite the use of
uterotonics, she only survives a postpartum haemorrhage
event due to an emergency hysterectomy. However, she
sustains prolonged disability related to severe maternal
morbidity, in addition to the grief of losing a child; her
family is forced further into poverty by the large out-of-
pocket expenses for the complications she experienced.
Thus, the whole process can be understood as a process
of embodiment, in which women internalise and embed
into their bodies and minds the interactions between
their being and the surrounding context and external and
internal forces.73 That is, the pregnant woman embodies
the intersections of complex, multidimensional forces.
Embodiment in the context of maternal health refers to
the integration of the physical, social, psychological, and
cultural aspects of a woman's lived experiences and how
these factors collectively influence her health and
wellbeing throughout the pregnancy journey and beyond.
The concept of embodiment recognises that maternal
health is not solely determined by biomedical factors that
underlie pregnancy events but is deeply shaped by the
broader context in which pregnancy occurs.
Specific factors associated with maternal mortality and
morbidity (ie, direct and indirect causes of mortality and
morbidity) represent concrete expressions of the context
and the forces described earlier, which might progress
with additional complications and organ dysfunctions—
the final common pathway to maternal mortality (panel).
Suicide, femicide, and other external causes of death
during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period
might follow a distinct and similarly complex path, but
also represent the embodiment of the interplay between
underlying social forces (eg, the patriarchy and other
gender social norms) and individual, family, and
community factors. This complexity highlights the
reduced agency many women still experience in their
maternal health trajectory, a constraint that is often
observed in low-income settings.
The various individual-level factors, lifestyles, social
forces, and their intersections affect the emergence of
biomedical and other factors that ultimately determine
maternal survival and wellbeing during a woman's
pregnancy journey. The resultant effect of all these forces

neutralising any detrimental forces and enhancing those
that are beneficial.
The role of the health system in maternal health
The health system plays a crucial role in shaping the
embodiment of the inter-related forces and contexts
presented earlier. Health services and commodities (eg,
quality-assured uterotonics to reduce postpartum blood
loss in a woman who presents with anaemia at the time
of birth) can modify the effects of eco-social forces that
lead to adverse maternal health outcomes. Therefore, the
health system can be considered a decisive protective
factor, able to neutralise or minimise the effects of
detrimental risk factors. Accordingly, the negative effects
of some risk factors, such as advanced maternal age or
low-income status, can be attenuated by well functioning
health services, particularly those with high-quality
preconception, antenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum
care.
In this context, quality of care emerges as a central
attribute of health services that can exert a protective
effect on maternal health. Quality is a multidimensional
concept translated into maternity services as the interplay
of available human resources, infrastructure, com-
modities, and effcient processes, producing a positive
care experience for the woman and favourable health
outcomes at an acceptable cost.74 However, and often due
to poor quality of care, health services might not be able
to modify or counterbalance adverse social determinants,
individual-level factors, lifestyles, and exposures. The
default health system configuration in many low-resource
settings features inadequate or suboptimal equipment for
screening and diagnosis, health-care worker shortages or
competency challenges, inadequate use of effective
maternal health interventions, or a combination of these
problems, which together coalesce into the so-called too
little, too late situation.ll Preventable deaths continue if
the chain of events leading to maternal mortality is not
interrupted. For instance, pre-eclampsia is easy and
inexpensive to diagnose, and potentially preventable with
health-care commodities (eg, aspirin); however, the
underdiagnosis of pre-eclampsia and underuse of
preventive measures continue to drive pre-eclampsia-
related mortality and morbidity in low-resource settings.
Furthermore, health services can be influenced by social
forces. For example, disrespect, abuse, and mistreatment
of women within maternity services often reflect gender,
ethnic, or social class biases against women and are
perpetrated by health-care providers, many of whom are
women and themselves affected by the same forces and
hierarchies within the health services.75
Although health systems have the potential to attenuate
adverse health factors, they can also cause hazards.
Complications of health interventions (ie, iatrogenic
factors) are an important contributor to all-cause
mortality and a substantial cause Ofor contributing factor
to maternal mortality.7677 Health interventions are
e311
designed and implemented to improve situations in
which the anticipated benefits outweigh potential risks.
For example, a medically indicated caesarean section can
be a life-saving intervention, and the underuse of
caesarean section is associated with poor maternal and
perinatal health outcomes. However, when health
interventions are implemented in situations with
relatively low risk of adverse outcomes, their benefits
might not outweigh their risks, and indeed could lead to
harm. The same intervention applied to a situation with
a lower risk of adverse outcomes might have a different
result. For example, the short-term and long-term
complications of a non-medically indicated caesarean
section outweigh the potential benefits for both the
woman and the baby.7S Ensuring rational use of caesarean
sections is of great importance, especially in settings
without reliable access to safe surgery.7S79 Promoting the
rational use of health interventions and preventing
interventions that are not medically justified (ie,
quaternary prevention) nor desired by the informed care
recipient can be a strong complement to quality of care,
good health outcomes, and a positive care experience.80
In addition, using non-medically indicated health
interventions can be a substantial resource drain (for
both society and the individual) that could further
complicate subsequent pregnancies, especially in
resource-constrained settings.7840
Maternal health determinants and transitions in
maternal mortality
Despite the substantial number of maternal deaths every
year, there is a slow but steady trend towards maternal
mortality reduction.6 This trend means that, over an
extended time period, the absolute number of maternal
deaths and the global MMR are gradually reducing. The
first worldwide estimates in the 1980s and early 1990s
indicated nearly 500000 maternal deaths per year. Three
decades later, the world has almost halved that incidence:
there were an estimated 287 000 maternal deaths in
2020.6 Countries with reliable maternal mortality data
since the mid-1900s or earlier also show similar trends.8182
Building on demographic,
epidemiological, and
nutritional transitions,83-S5 a transition model to describe
the gradual shift from a pattern of high maternal
mortality to a pattern of low maternal mortality at the
country level was developed by Souza and colleagues.18
Based on the notion that maternal health is the product
of a multifactorial process, as described earlier, this
transition model relates levels of maternal mortality to
social development, reproductive health indicators,
biomedical causes of maternal mortality, and the
organisation and quality of health care. The central
hypothesis of this transition model is that social
development offers protection from or mitigation of the
detrimental effects of distal and proximal determinants,
producing a trend towards maternal mortality reduction.
In other words, as social development advances, maternal

mortality tends to decrease. The maternal mortality
transition stage of a country could therefore be
conceptualised as the net result of the dynamic balance
between the predominant forces of determinants and the
advancements in social development to counteract these
forces.
Although the mortality transition model describes a
continuous process, stages within the model are used to
identify patterns associated with the level of maternal
mortality in various countries. To propose the stages of
the transition model, we adopted the MMR cutoffs used
in the WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, and the World Bank
report on trends in maternal mortality from 2000 to
2020.6 Stage 1 was proposed as a very high maternal
mortality stage (MMR 2500 maternal deaths per
100000 livebirths), stage 2 represents high maternal
mortality (MMR 300—499), stage 3 represents inter-
mediate maternal mortality (MMR 100—299), and stage 4
represents low and very low maternal mortality
(MMR <IOO). A theoretical stage 5, in which hypothetically
all preventable maternal deaths have been prevented, is
also included. The MMR cutoff for stage 5 is diffcult to
determine, but one could hypothesise it to be less than
one maternal death per 100 000 livebirths, since maternal
mortality enquiries in countries with low and very low
maternal mortality (ie, those in stage 4A and 4B) continue
to show potential preventability of maternal deaths.S6 The
Series
acknowledged as arbitrary, as they are principally used to
illustrate the flow of countries across typologies of social
and health development. Nevertheless, the depicted
stages are pointers to predominant eco-social forces and
levels of social development and can be useful to explore
broader, multifaceted strategies to tackle maternal health
challenges at the country level (table 1). Notably, several
stages of transition might co-exist within the same
country.
Table 2 shows the distribution of countries according
to the transition stages and years when global maternal
mortality estimates were reported. Between 2000 and
2020, the number of countries in stage 1 has steadily
decreased, whereas the number of countries in stage 4
has increased, particularly in stage 4B. Of the
185 countries with maternal mortality estimates during
the reported period, 43 were already in stage 4B in 2000,
leaving 142 that could potentially transition across
stages. 63 countries progressed at least one stage, with
nine countries transitioning two stages (eg, from stage 1
to stage 3). Angola, for instance, was in stage 1 in 2000,
moved into stage 2 in 2010, and was in stage 3 in 2015.
No country transitioned over four stages (ie, from stage 1
to stage 4A or from stage 2 to stage 4B). One country was
in stage 4A in 2000 and remained in stage 3 in
subsequent assessed years. Overall, 121 of the 185
countries remained at the same stage of transition
during the reported period.

Summary characteristics
Very high maternal mortality, with high neonatal mortality
rate, high fertility, and low life expectancy. The reach of the
health system is small (low universal health coverage, low
skilled birth attendance coverage, high risk of
impoverishing expenditure for surgical care, and very low
caesarean section rate). The human development index in
this stage is low, with increased gender inequality.
Stages 2 and 3 are transition stages with intermediate to
high maternal mortality, and intermediate levels of
neonatal mortality, life expectancy, health system reach,
and social indicators. Considering these characteristics,
stage 2 is closer to stage 1 and stage 3 is closer to stage 4.
A low maternal mortality stage. Stage 4 is associated with
low neonatal mortality, low fertility rate, and high life
expectancy. The health system has increased reach relative
to previous stages, with very high coverage of skilled birth
attendance. Medical interventions can occur without
medical indications. Social indicators are also favourable.
Stage 5 is a theoretical stage. The hypothesis is that it will
be an improved version of stage 4B.

Key attributes of maternal health determinants
Environmental and climate effects are moderate to serious, with low environmental protection and no
climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place. Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are prevalent. Violence, conflicts, internal displacements, and political instability are
common. The economy is weak and not resilient to external forces. Gender discrimination, structural
bias, and poor social development are common. The health system is weak and can be influenced by the
effects of social forces, allowing embodiment of overwhelming biomedical factors underlying maternal
death and morbidity.
Environmental and climate effects are moderate to serious, with some environmental protection and
few climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place. Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are less prevalent than stage 1. Violence, conflicts, internal displacements, and political
instability are less common than stage 1. The economy is more stable and resistant to external forces
compared with stage 1. Effects of gender discrimination and structural bias are increasingly addressed by
social development programmes. The health system is stronger and less permeable to the effects of
social forces compared with previous stages; however, the health system struggles with care for women
with obstetric emergencies, pre-existing risk factors, and exposures to external agents associated with
maternal death and morbidity.
Environmental and climate effects are moderate, with several environmental protection and some
climate adaptation and mitigation activities in place. Cultural practices that are unfavourable to
maternal health are rare. Violence, conflicts, internal displacements, and political instability are rare.
The economy is strong and fairly resistant to external forces. Gender discrimination and structural bias
are addressed by social development programmes, but gaps persist. Health system is stronger and more
resistant to the effects of social forces compared with previous stages.
Environmental and climate effects are minimal, with robust environmental protection and climate
adaptation and mitigation activities in place. Cultural practices that are unfavourable to maternal health
are non-existent. Violence, conflicts, internal displacements, or political instability are practically
non-existent. The economy is very strong, robust, and resilient to external forces. Social development
prevails over gender discrimination and other structural biases. The health system is very strong and
resistant to the effects of social forces, and it is configured to address rare or emerging complications,
leaving no one behind.

Table 3 presents the characteristics of the transition
stages. As the transition stage progresses to higher levels
and maternal mortality decreases, there are decreasing
trends for neonatal maternal mortality, fertility rate,
and risk of impoverishing expenditure for surgical
care. In addition, reduction of maternal mortality is
associated with increases in life expectancy, universal
health coverage, skilled birth attendance, antenatal care
coverage, and the human development index. The
neonatal mortality rate shows a strong correlation
with maternal mortality, suggesting that this indicator is
most probably a product of similar determinants.
Similarly, health-system indicators, such as universal

The maternal mortality ratio is indicated in parentheses for each stage and range

from the WHO-World Bank report on trends in maternal mortality from
2000 to 2020.6
Table 2: Distribution and number of countries per maternal mortality
transition stage and year (N=185)
correlate strongly with maternal mortality levels,
demonstrating the crucial role of health systems in
safeguarding maternal health against external forces. In
contrast, the less strong correlations between other social
indicators (eg, Gini index that measures national income
or wealth distribution) and maternal mortality suggests
that the relationship is more distant, possibly indirect, or
mediated by other factors.
Caesarean section rate as an indicator deserves further
consideration, which is beyond the scope of our analysis.
Notably, countries with high and very high maternal
mortality (in maternal mortality transition stages 1 and 2)
showed a very low median caesarean section rate at the
country level (ie, a caesarean section rate well below 10%).
This finding suggests that underuse of this intervention
might have a contributory role in maternal mortality.
However, the relationship between caesarean section rate
and maternal mortality at the country level is not linear.
The correlation between caesarean section rate and
maternal mortality is only moderate (R2=O • 59) and might
be subject to an upper limit, as countries with low and
very low maternal mortality presented similar median
caesarean section rates at the country level in the range
of 25—27% (table 3).
This multifactorial causal pathway makes the collective
goal to reduce maternal mortality a complex endeavour
due to the absence of a single solution. Although maternal
mortality is a complex issue, resources allocated to address
it are often disproportionately low.

countries according to MMR levels aims to identify
patterns of determinants that would be more influential
in each stage of transition. Such stratification might have
several limitations, which should be considered.
Nonetheless, a typology of transition stages (derived from
tables 2 and 3) is presented in table 1. These transition
stages, their characteristics, and key attributes of maternal
health determinants could be some of the several pieces of
information used in developing multisectoral strategies to
improve maternal health and wellbeing.
Conclusions and recommendations for policy
and research
Maternal ill-health and disability are social problems,
and maternal mortality is a social tragedy. The reduction
of maternal mortality and the promotion of maternal
health and wellbeing are complex endeavours. This
paper in the Series on maternal health describes the deep
connections between maternal health outcomes and
modifiable and unmodifiable factors that are often
ignored in intervention programmes because of their
complexity. Tackling maternal mortality will require
broader actions that go beyond biomedical causes, which
manifest at a late stage in the events between a healthy
state and severe morbidity or death. Policy makers,
particularly those in countries with high maternal
mortality burden, must recognise that the main
biomedical causes (eg, postpartum haemorrhage, pre-
eclampsia, infection, and abortion) of preventable
maternal deaths do not happen in isolation. That
121 countries have remained in the same mortality
transition bracket for the past two decades is therefore
unsurprising. For countries to progress across transition
stages in their mortality reduction efforts, there must be
renewed focus on strategies to address the underlying
determinants described in the previous sections.
Multisectoral action to promote social development and
gender equality is necessary for sustainable reduction in
maternal mortality. Although the implementation of
these strategies (eg, improvements in social infrastructure
and other social transformation programmes) is often
slow to realise, their longer-term benefits are reasonably
certain.
In this context, the health sector has a pivotal role to play.
Social aspects aside, actions taken by the health system, at
the health service level, represent a final opportunity to
save the lives and improve the health and wellbeing of
women who have birth-related complications. Expanding
the health sector ecosystem and care networks to mitigate
the detrimental effects of distal and proximal determinants
will substantively improve maternal health. Expanding
demand for and increasing access to high-quality
reproductive health services and commodities (eg, modern
contraception, safe abortion, and antenatal, intrapartum,
and postpartum care) are needed for primary prevention,
Series
coverage and strengthening the health system to provide
quality care is essential to reduce maternal mortality and
promote maternal health and wellbeing.
Future research should aim to establish the correlation
between key determinants and stages of the maternal
mortality transition at national or regional levels to
facilitate evidence-informed and individually tailored
strategies and rapidly accelerate countries towards a very
low maternal mortality transition stage.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Youth in foster care are often excluded from participating in planning for their permanent homes and making
other decisions about their lives. In the past decade, there has been an increasing call for laws, policies, and
practices that ensure a youth's right to participation in child welfare and other youth-serving systems. Child
welfare, which is often associated with trauma, lack of power, and other disadvantages for involved families, is a
complicated context for engaging youth in the processes intended to protect them. From the motivational
perspective of Self-Determination Theory (SDT), child welfare workers can understand promoting engagement as
creating conditions that meet a youth's basic psychological needs. The current study used SDT as a framework to
analyze in-depth interviews with youth about their experiences with family case planning meetings. Findings
explain why different family meeting practices promoted or undermined youth engagement by creating certain
contextual conditions (warm/caring, structured/predictable, and supportive of genuine preferences). Some
family meeting practices functioned differently in promoting youth engagement depending on the extent to
which youth experienced their needs being met. SDT offers both a way to understand casework practices in terms
of the conditions they create, and a framework for reflecting on why certain practices operate in different ways
for different youth. Workers who understand that engagement stems from meeting individual needs will be better
able to promote youth participation in family meetings and their well-being.
Historically, youth's opinions have not been highly valued nor seen
as necessary for making decisions about their futures (
Bell, 1995
). This is
especially pronounced for youth in foster care who are often excluded
from participating in planning for their permanent homes and making
other decisions about their lives (Salazar, Spiers, & Pfister, 2021;
Freundlich, Avery, & Padgett, 2007; Toros, 2021). In the child welfare
context, exclusion is often the result of well-meaning adults who believe
it is their duty to make and enforce decisions in the youth's best interest
(Jensen, Studsrød, & Ellingsen, 2020; Kosher & Ben-Arieh, 2020)
The past decade brought an increase in legislative actions to ensure
youth involved in the child welfare system are included in decisions
about their lives and futures
(Merkel-Holguin, Schwab-Reese, Drury,
Allan, & Hollinshead, 2020; Salazar et al., 2021). For example, the
Children' s Bureau in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF)
released an Information Memorandum calling for "engaging, empow-
ering, and utilizing family and youth voice in all aspects of child wel-
fare" as both a moral imperative and as developmentally supportive for

youth (Administration for Children and Families [ACF], 2019,
p. 1). The
purpose of the Information Memorandum was "to demonstrate that
family and youth voice are critical to a well-functioning child welfare
system," and it serves as a call to action for "public child welfare
agencies, dependency courts, and Court Improvement Programs to work
together to ensure that family and youth voice are central in child
welfare program planning and improvement efforts" (
ACF, 2019,
ACF's call for youth voice and inclusion in permanency planning
created an imperative for the child welfare workforce, outlining several
principles for improvement (e.g., prioritize youth voice, challenge
inherent power imbalances, enhance capacity of workforce to hear and
act on youth voice) that heavily depend on the understanding, skill, and
power afforded to workers. Child welfare workers (here referred to as
"caseworkers") are expected to create conditions that support youth
voice and inclusion, yet there is relatively little theory and empirical
evidence that explains how casework practices create conditions that
promote youth engagement in permanency planning, especially from
the youth's perspective (Dillon, Greenop, & Hills, 2015; Woodman,
). To address this gap, the purpose of this

research was to use the motivational lens offered by Self-Determination
Theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2008
) to analyze caseworkers' efforts to
engage youth in family child welfare case planning meetings, and to
center the youth's experience of the conditions that promoted (or
undermined) their engagement. This work stems from a larger evalua-
tion of Oregon's Title IV-E Waiver Demonstration intervention,
Leveraging Intensive Family Engagement (LIFE), which had family
planning meetings and youth engagement as central components.
1.1. Youth engagement as a best practice in child welfare
ACF's Information Memorandum names youth engagement in plan-
ning and decision-making as a child welfare best practice that also
supports youth development (
). Youth engagement and
ACF, 2019
participation are often discussed synonymously in the literature (e.g.,
Augsberger, 2014; Boel-Studt, Schelbe, Deichen Hansen, & Tobia, 2018;
Salazar et al., 2021); however, the spectrum of youth participation spans
from manipulation (adults represent their own agendas through the
guise of youth perspectives) to authentic participation (youth initiated,
shared decision-making with adults) (Ramey, Lawford, & Vachon,
). From a motivational perspective, engagement is conceptually
2017
similar to authentic youth participation, which requires sharing power
and information, ongoing participation in decision-making processes,
and a genuine consideration of a youth's perspectives (Franklin &
). Although engagement
Sloper, 2005; Vis, Strandbu, & Thomas, 2011
can be challenging in the hierarchal child welfare system where adults
(child welfare workers, attorneys, etc.) usually define concerns and
make decisions, it should be understood as a right for youth and as a
duty for child welfare workers (
Dillon et al., 2015)
Research suggests that youth participation in planning and decision-
making processes has developmental benefits when done in a support-
ive, trauma-informed manner — youth are given information, prepared
for what is going to happen, made aware of their options, and receive
help in expressing themselves during the proceedings (Checkoway,
2011; Simmons-Horton, 2017; Vis et al., 2011
). Engagement in decision-
making has been found to support a youth's sense of empowerment,
leadership, and competence (Forenza, 2016; Zeldin, Gauley, Krauss,
). Furthermore, youth participation in their
Kornbluh, & Collura, 2017
permanency planning may "increase feelings of well-being" and
"improve children's safety [and] increase the success of care arrange-
ments" (Vis et al., 2011, p. 333). More broadly, recent research on co-
regulation processes in child welfare (i.e., warm relationships, coach-
ing, and feedback between youth and caring adults) suggests that co-
created supportive contexts can promote a youth's self-regulation
skills (
). As such, it is important for caseworkers to
McKenzie, 2020
have a framework for understanding how to create conditions that
support youth engagement in family meetings.
1.2. Self-Determination Theory: A motivational framework
Self-Determination Theory (SDT;
Deci & Ryan, 2008; Ryan & Deci,
), a macrotheory of human motivation across the lifespan, offers a
2017
framework that helps explain engagement. SDT posits that interpersonal
Children and Youth Services Review 155 (2023) 107183
interactions (for example, between youth and caseworkers) create
conditions that support or undermine an individual's engagement based
on the extent to which they meet the individual's basic psychological
needs for relatedness, competence, and autonomy (
Deci & Ryan, 2008)
(see
Fig. 1)
Relatedness is the need for connection with others, feeling like
others care about you, and having a sense of belonging and worth.
Spending time with people who are warm and caring creates conditions
that meet one's need for relatedness, whereas indifferent, rejecting, or
hostile interactions with a social partner can thwart this need.
Competence is the need to feel effective in your ability to produce
desired outcomes, learn new skills, or to understand information. In-
teractions that offer structure and predictability (e.g., clear communica-
tion, reliability, responsiveness) create conditions that meet one's need
for competence. In contrast, experiences that create chaos and uncer-
tainty will fail to meet this need.
Autonomy is the need to express your authentic self, direct your own
action, and have a sense of control. Experiences that make room for and
support one's genuine preferences, worldview, and choices create con-
ditions that meet one's need for autonomy. On the other hand, feeling
coerced or disregarded by a social partner can frustrate this need.
SDT suggests that if an individual's three basic needs are met, they
are more likely to be emotionally, behaviorally, and/or cognitively
engaged in a given context and go on to experience greater well-being
). In the current study, we
(Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2017
define engagement as a youth feeling involved, persistent, focused, and/
or emotionally positive (e.g.,
Skinner, Kindermann, Connell, & Well-
) during their family case planning meetings. SDT's focus on
born, 2009
needs fulfillment implies that the process of engagement should be
individualized because caseworker practices (i.e., interactions with
youth during family meetings) function differently depending on the
extent to which the practices create conditions that meet the youth's
needs. For example, frequent in-person contact with their caseworker
might create warm and caring conditions for one youth, which meets
their need for relatedness and therefore encourages engagement. On the
other hand, another youth could feel overwhelmed with too much in-
person contact, which would thwart their need for relatedness and un-
dermine their engagement.
1.3. Using SDT to organize the current literature on promoting youth
engagement
As described, SDT defines contextual conditions that meet three
basic needs: warm and caring conditions will meet needs for relatedness,
structured and predictable conditions will meet needs for competence,
and conditions that are supportive of genuine preferences meet needs for
autonomy. These three contextual conditions offer a useful framework
for organizing existing research on caseworker practices.
1.3.1. Warm and caring conditions
Warm and caring conditions, characterized by a youth feeling like
they have trusted and caring adult allies with some power in the child
welfare system, are central in promoting youth engagement (Kennan,

Brady, & Forkan, 2018; van Bijleveld, Dedding, & Bunders-Aelen, 2015)
Having regular contact over time with a youth, listening, and following
through when a youth communicates a need or concern are examples of
caseworker practices that establish trust and demonstrate care
McGregor, Devaney, & Moran, 2019). A trusted adult is someone who
values a youth, recognizes their capacity to hear the truth and face
adversity, and does not speak negatively about the youth to others
). Caseworkers and meeting facilitators can also
McGregor et al., 2019
convey trust and care when they take time to familiarize themselves
with a youth's case, speak with the youth before a family meeting, and
develop a personal connection (Pölkki, Vornanen, Pursiainen, & Riiko-
nen, 2012; Augsberger, 2014)
1.3.2. Structured and predictable conditions
Structured and predictable conditions, in which a youth has the
experience of adults sharing information with them, explaining what is
happening, and educating them about the child welfare system, help
promote youth engagement (
Cashmore, 2002
). Research suggests that a
youth will feel more confident and willing to participate when they
know the structure and agenda of the meeting, their rights, the status of
their case, relevant legal and other system processes, policies around
privacy and confidentiality, and the role of attendees (Archard & Ski-
venes, 2009; Nybell, 2013; van Bijleveld et al., 2015). Moreover, a youth
will feel engaged in family meetings when the facilitator maintains a
consistent structure (e.g., agenda, ground rules), keeps the meeting
focused on the youth, clarifies parameters pertaining to privacy and
confidentiality, uses plain language (i.e., avoids technical language,
jargon, and acronyms), and brainstorms concrete steps to help the youth
meet their goals (Augsberger, 2014; Cashmore, 2002)
1.3.3. Conditions that support genuine preferences
Conditions support a youth's genuine preferences when the youth
feels they have the agency to speak or express their desires, opinions,
and authentic self. Caseworkers working to create these conditions
demonstrate their belief that the youth has the right to, and is capable of,
participating in their family's case planning (Archard & Skivenes, 2009;
van Bijleveld et al., 2015). Practices that support a youth's genuine
preferences include encouraging the youth to speak for themselves or
having a trusted adult speak for them, and/or offering alternative ways
for the youth to participate in family meetings (
Cashmore, 2002
Family meeting facilitators can center youth voice by designating time
for the youth to speak; insisting their opinions are thoroughly consid-
ered; not allowing other meeting attendees to dominate the conversa-
tion; and maintaining focus on the youth's needs and expressed desires
Augsberger, 2014). If a youth's preferences cannot be honored, case-
workers can help the youth understand the reasons behind the decisions
Archard & Skivenes, 2009; van Bijleveld et al., 2015; Kennan et al.,
). As such, supporting a youth's genuine pref-
2018; Pölkki et al., 2012
erences creates a space for them to "have a say" while not necessarily
youth "getting their way" (
Cashmore, 2002)
1.4. Study goals
Through an SDT lens, engaging youth in family meetings is a process
of centering youth's needs and creating conditions that meet them. As
evidenced in the previous section, caseworker practices that create
conditions that meet SDT's three basic needs are already reflected in the
literature. Indeed,
suggested that the most effective
Cashmore (2002)
ways to ensure young people are engaged in decisions that affect their
lives are for them to be able to talk with someone they trust (related-
ness), to be informed about what is happening (competence), and to
have the opportunity and choice to say what it is they want (autonomy).
The goal of this study was to use SDT to analyze youth's experiences
with family meetings to identify the conditions that met their three basic
needs, and to explain why certain practices created conditions that either
supported or undermined youth engagement. In doing so, we expected
Children and Youth Services Review 155 (2023) 107183
to find that some practices functioned differently for youth depending
on the extent to which the conditions met their unique needs. Thus, SDT
offers both a framework to organize family meeting practices and their
influence on youth engagement, and a tool for reflecting on why certain
practices functioned differently for different youth.
2. Methods
This research was part of a larger evaluation of Oregon's Title IV-E
Waiver Demonstration known as LIFE. The LIFE model combined
ongoing, monthly family case planning meetings with a dedicated,
trained facilitator (referred to as the Family Engagement Facilitator),
enhanced relative search techniques (i.e., efforts to identify and include
kith and kin), and peer parent mentors to increase parents' engagement
in family meetings (Child Welfare Partnership, 2020). LIFE was founded
on four practice values: (1) parent-driven, youth-guided, (2) strengths
based, (3) culturally responsive, and (4) trauma informed. As part of the
LIFE model, the youth-guided practice value required that facilitators
made efforts to include youth in all facets of family meetings (e.g.,
preparation, agenda development, scheduling and logistics, participa-
tion, and decision-making). Given the LIFE model's focus on youth
engagement, the evaluation team conducted a sub-study to better un-
derstand the experiences of youth as their LIFE team worked to include
them in monthly family meetings.
2.1. Recruitment procedures
Recruitment for the youth engagement sub-study took place January
2017 through April 2018. Forms and procedures were reviewed and
approved by a university human subjects review board and the child
welfare agency. All new LIFE cases during this period were screened for
youth between the ages of 10 and 18 years old. If both the facilitator and
the caseworker agreed that the youth was able to meaningfully (physi-
cally, cognitively, and emotionally) participate in a 45-minute inter-
view, and to understand what it meant to give consent/assent to
participate, the youth was invited to participate in the sub-study. As a
first step, the facilitator approached the youth, usually shortly after their
first family meeting, told them about the study, and asked them for
consent to share their contact information with the evaluation team. If
the youth agreed, the facilitator forwarded the youth's contact infor-
mation to a designated evaluation team member (n 79). Facilitators
told the youth that agreeing to be contacted by the evaluation team did
not ensure they would be contacted. Due to resource constraints, the
evaluation team aimed to interview a sample of 30 youth proportional to
caseloads across the three jurisdictions implementing LIFE services.
The next step was for an evaluation team member to contact the
youth and invite them to participate in the sub-study. An evaluation
team member reached out to the youth by phone, described the inter-
view in more detail, and answered their questions (if any). Youth 14
years old and older provided their own consent to participate. Youth 13
years old and younger also needed consent from their legal guardian,
typically their caseworker, prior to an evaluation staff contacting them.
Once contacted, the evaluation team member asked the youth to assent
to participate. If the youth agreed to participate, the evaluation team
member scheduled an interview at a time and place that felt comfortable
to the youth.
2.2. Interview procedures
Ideally, interviewers had observed at least one of the family's case
planning meetings before doing the interview so they had some infor-
mation about the meetings and the case, and had an opportunity to build
rapport with the youth. Due to delays in inviting youth to participate in
the evaluation, the logistics of scheduling interviews, and some youth
choosing not to participate in their family's meetings, this did not
happen for approximately 10% of the youth interviewed. Most
3

interviews took place within the first six months of the youth signing
their consent form, although some occurred up to 15 months after the
youth consented.
Interviews lasted up to an hour but most took 20 to 40 minutes, and
all were conducted in English. Youth were interviewed at a location of
their choice, typically their foster home or the child welfare office, and
received a $40 gift card for participating. Four members of the evalua-
tion team conducted interviews (three are authors of this research). One
evaluation staff (and author) conducted most interviews and the
remainder were split across three other staff (two authors). Interviews
were recorded with permission and transcribed for analysis.
2.3. Participants
Evaluation staff invited 39 youth to participate in an interview. Of
those, 27 youth whose families were receiving LIFE services participated
in interviews. On two occasions, sibling pairs requested that they talk
with the interviewer together. In addition, six youth were available to
participate in both an initial and a follow-up interview. As shown in
the evaluation team conducted 25 initial interviews (with 27
Table 1,
youth) and six follow-up interviews. Youth were 14 years old on
average, but ages ranged from 12 to 17 (missing age for one youth). Just
over half the participants identified as male (55.6%) and the remainder
identified as female. More than one-third of the youth interviewed
identified as African American/Black, American Indian/Native Amer-
ican, or Latine/Hispanic (37.0%), whereas two-thirds either identified
as white or their race/ethnicity was unknown. Most of the youth
(70.4%) lived in communities that met the federal criteria for rural
designation and the remaining resided in urban areas. Most youth
completed their first interview within six months of agreeing to be
contacted by an evaluation staff and, once interviewed, most (85.1 %)
had attended two or more of their family meetings.
2.4. Interview guide
The interview guide was semi-structured (i.e., questions were
designed more like prompts) to allow for flexibility in exploring topics
raised by youth and responsiveness to individual differences between
youth (e.g., age, gender, family configuration). This method allowed
interviewers to restate questions, speak in a developmentally appro-
priate manner, probe for additional information, and check for under-
standing. Moreover, members of the LIFE Youth Advisory Board (a
group of youth with lived experience in child welfare convened to
support the evaluation) twice met with interviewers to help them

practice their approach (e.g., language, rapport building) and provide
feedback for improvement.
The interview was organized into five broad categories that aligned
with SDT's three basic needs: personal goals, informational needs, voice
and choice, their LIFE team, and relationships. In the personal goals
section, the interviewer asked the youth to describe their personal goals
and the extent to which their LIFE team listened to and supported them
in pursuing their goals. Questions in the informational needs section
asked whether the youth was getting the information they wanted about
their case, from whom, and how helpful it was. Voice and choice ques-
tions explored whether the youth had opportunities to make choices
about their lives, if they felt like they had a say, and if their LIFE team
listened and responded to them. The LIFE team section included ques-
tions about how the family meeting team worked to support their
participation and engagement. Last, the questions about relationships
focused on the youth's feelings of connection, comfort, and trust with
people on their LIFE team. We invited the youth to talk about their ex-
periences of LIFE services and with child welfare more generally,
including what they found helpful/unhelpful and suggestions for
improvement.
2.5. Data analysis
We utilized thematic analysis (Braun, Clarke, Hayfield, & Terry,
) and used AtlasTi qualitative analysis software for data manage-
2018
ment, coding, and analysis. The person who conducted most of the in-
terviews did an initial review of five transcripts. Coding was both
inductive and deductive — the five broad categories that organized the
interview guide provided a starting point but the team added themes as
they emerged from the data, and an initial coding schema was devel-
oped. As the evaluation team completed additional interviews, dyads
(that included the interviewer) coded transcripts. Dyads first coded the
transcripts independently using the initial coding schema while being
open to the emergence of new themes; then they met to check for
agreement, identify emergent topics, and resolve any differences. After
they reached inter-rater reliability (agreement on all codes), the inter-
viewer coded the remaining transcripts and brought questions and new
topics to the evaluation team for discussion.
The evaluation team met regularly to troubleshoot the process and
we used constant comparison to generate and refine the themes (i.e.,
examining themes in relation to each other and to the original interview
data). For example, the initial five broad categories were personal goals,
informational needs, choice, the LIFE team, and relationships. As the
coding progressed, we added themes pertaining to well-being, youth
voice, and LIFE team responsiveness, and the meaning of other themes
evolved from their original definitions. The process was iterative and
multiple rounds of revisions occurred before the team finalized the
themes (
Braun et al., 2018)
3. Results
We organized findings using SDT's three supportive conditions: (1)
warm/caring, (2) structured/predictable, and (3) supportive of genuine
preferences. Within each condition, we explored how youth described
experiences that met their needs and promoted their engagement (see
). As expected, there were functional differences in the extent to
Table 2
which certain caseworker practices created conditions that met needs
and therefore supported engagement. This suggests the importance of
creating conditions that meet individual needs rather than universally
enacting practices that not all youth would necessarily experience as
supportive.
3.1. Warm and caring conditions
Youth described ways in which their family meeting team (i.e., LIFE
team) created warm and caring conditions and, in turn, met their need

Youth invited to participate in an
adult-focused family meeting
that didn't feel relevant to them
for relatedness and encouraged their meeting participation. Taking time
to build a trusting relationship (for example, by spending time preparing
the youth for their family meeting) was an important way in which
adults met a youth's need for relatedness. In many cases the presence of
just one trusted individual (e.g., relative, caseworker, facilitator, foster
parent) was enough to convince the youth to attend. Youth often
mentioned counselors, therapists, and Court Appointed Special Advo-
cates as people they trusted. They thought of these people as being "on
my side." One youth described how coming to know their LIFE team
members helped them communicate more openly during meetings:
'I just have a group of people that I know personally, that I have
known for some time now... It is not just a complete group of
strangers that I barely know.. .but I feel comfortable with them so I
don't really mind talking about stuff with them."
In another example, the facilitator helped a youth feel accepted by
the group which in turn promoted the youth's engagement:
"We had this one meeting, because I did something stupid and
[facilitator] asked if anyone would want to share anything they did
similar in their teenage years. And all of them did. It just made me
feel more close to them. .. they opened up to me so I thought I might
as well open up to them, too."
In contrast, sometimes youth did not experience interactions with
their LIFE team as warm and caring. A few youth did not feel comfort-
able speaking at the meeting because the team made them feel anxious,
confused, or fearful of saying something that might make things worse.
Children and Youth Services Review 155 (2023) 107183
This lack of trust in their LIFE team made it more challenging for youth
to participate in meetings. Moreover, participating in a meeting that
focused on what the youth had "done wrong," as one youth put it, made
them "feel like I am just in a meeting about people just criticizing me."
Conditions in which a youth felt criticized or rejected undermined their
need for relatedness.
Including siblings or other family members helped many youth feel a
sense of connection to the people present and therefore more willing to
participate in meetings. One youth chose to go to LIFE meetings because
'I take that as a time to see [my siblings]" and when the siblings stopped
going, the youth saw no point in attending. However, including family
members did not universally meet youth's need for connection and
therefore did not always encourage engagement. Some youth said they
avoided meetings because they did not want to see their parents or other
relatives, or they wanted to avoid conflict between family members. For
example, one youth explained how the presence of a family member
interfered with their ability to share their placement preferences:
"When [my relative] is on the phone [during a meeting] I can't really
talk... .1 want to make my [relative] happy. Whenever I am there she
says I wish you could just come stay with me. I don't want to hurt her
feelings, but I don't really want to [live with her]. I do want to go stay
with her just for the holidays and stuff."
This example highlights how a practice - inviting family members to
participate in meetings - that promoted warmth and connection for some
youth discouraged engagement for others because it did not create
conditions that met their need for relatedness.
3.2. Structured/predictable conditions
Family meeting practices that created structure and predictability,
such as having regular meetings, sharing information, transparency, and
preparing youth for meetings, helped meet youth's needs for compe-
tence and encouraged their participation. For some youth, having reg-
ular meetings helped them know what was going on with their family's
case. Access to information, according to SDT, can meet a youth's need
for competence and therefore encourage their participation in their
family meeting. One youth described it:
"I want to be there because I am the child that is in foster care and I
want to know what's going on, instead of just being outside of the
box and not knowing what is going on. I want to be inside of the box
and know."
In addition to hearing more about what was going on with their
family's case, regular meetings provided some youth with an opportu-
nity to ask questions of their LIFE team. One youth explained how
meetings were an opportunity for them to fill in missing information and
to discuss certain topics, "They go over every little bit of the case and if
they missed something, then you can tell them, and ask them if they can
talk about it, and most likely they will."
Regular meetings were also a way for youth to have transparent
conversations and develop a shared understanding of key issues with
their team. Illustrating this point, a youth described their experience
with meetings:
"It gets you on a plan, makes you more aware of what's happening,
gets everyone together so they are in the room discussing stuff. It just
feels better to have everyone at once instead of going individually to
talk to people. Everyone gets the picture and the idea all at once."
Youth did not uniformly experience information sharing and trans-
parent conversations as creating structured and predictable conditions,
and therefore did not meet their needs for competence and encourage
participation in family meetings. For example, some youth did not want
to hear about the "bad stuff' going on in their family because it led to a
loss of hope and feelings of apathy and helplessness, especially if the
youth had a long history in child welfare. One youth said, "I don't really
5


C.J. Furrer et al.
like to go to the meetings. It is just [that] I don't really like talking about
some of the stuff that is going on." Furthermore, not all youth were able
to get their questions answered during meetings. One youth said that
their "caseworker doesn't know sometimes, so it is kind of difficult
getting answers." Together these findings underscore the importance of
learning about a youth's needs before enacting a practice.
Meeting preparation practices often created structured and predict-
able conditions by giving youth advance information about the agenda
and who would attend, and by providing opportunities for them to ask
questions, request information, and express needs. These conditions,
according to SDT, can support a youth's need for competence and
encourage engagement. One youth described how their facilitator met
with them before their first meeting and explained "what was going to
be talked about, who all was going to be there. .and anybody that I
wanted to be there to support me .
In contrast, some youth had negative experiences during meetings
because they were not prepared by their facilitator, or the facilitator did
not follow through on what had been discussed during preparation.
Youth who were not prepared sometimes experienced their LIFE team as
demanding information and explanations they weren't prepared to
provide. These more chaotic conditions did not meet the youth's need
for competence and made them feel pressure to share more information
than they wanted. One youth explained, "When we talked about me
running away I felt a lot like people did get really needy... They needed
to just know everything about why, when I don't know."
3.3. Conditions that support genuine preferences
One of the LIFE model's underlying values was "youth-guided" and
meetings were designed to encourage youth participation and involve-
ment in decision-making. Having a voice and opportunities to make
choices, being listened to, getting explanations for why decisions were
made, and participating in meetings that feel relevant are practices that
can create conditions supportive of youth's genuine preferences, which
meet their need for autonomy and encourage engagement. Some youth
described how their LIFE team listened to them, responded to their
needs, and acted upon their requests. One youth said ..they actually
listen, especially when we are all in the meetings. So actually hearing
what we have to say, they can put it into action." Another youth
described how their LIFE team was responsive to their needs, "It is nice
to get with everybody, especially when I need something. Everyone is
there and I can tell them all straight up what I need so they all work on it.
That is pretty helpful."
Including youth in decision-making about permanency options,
especially if the plan shifted away from reunification, felt supportive for
many youth. For example, some LIFE teams spent time exploring per-
manent placement options, allowing youth to have a say about their
future. One youth described that the agency let them choose where they
wanted to live:
..we can stay if we want to with [relative]. I think she is trying to
get DHS out of it with us, plus we really don't want to go back with
our [parent] yet, or at all, if that. I wanted to stay here, and my
[parent] finally gave custody to my [relative] for us so we can go
wherever."
It was important for youth to feel like their family meetings were
relevant to them, and that they had some say about the content. Some
youth said their facilitators offered them choices about what would be
discussed. For example, a youth described how "before the meetings
[facilitator] will call me and ask me what we can talk about and what we
can't talk about." In contrast, some youth described meetings as too
parent-focused, and said that they felt tedious, repetitive, uninforma-
tive, and pointless. One youth described their family meetings as
"parent-centered," which discouraged their participation:
Children and Youth Services Review 155 (2023) 107183
"So, I don't go anymore because.. .the meetings were very parent-
centered. .. .and on top of that it was the same thing every time. It
was all about Mom and it was super irritating. I am being dragged out
of school, where I want to be. ... We would go and it would be Mom,
Mom, Mom. 0K, now let's talk about the kids for the last 15 min. I
was like, 'I don't care about what she's doing.' I thought it was going
to center around us and how we were feeling and what we need. It is
more revolving around my mom."
Youth also described practices that created conditions that made
them feel coerced or disregarded, thereby thwarting their need for au-
tonomy and undermining their engagement in family meetings. For
example, some youth noted that their LIFE team was unresponsive or
even went against their wishes; others felt the team was judgmental or
critical. Another youth described a lack of follow through, "I just feel
when I ask to know something, people say they are going to find out but
they don't really do it that much." Youth also described being inter-
rupted when they spoke, and others felt a lack of support for goals,
choices, and desires. One youth said:
"All the meetings — nobody ever listened to me on any of my opinions
on things. They would ask how I felt about certain things that
happened in the case and I said I don't really like it, but they would
do it anyway."
Some youth said that their LIFE teams disregarded their input, ideas,
and preferences. As one youth put it, "Just because I'm a kid doesn't
mean I don't know what I am talking about. I do know what I'm talking
about. I have been through enough to know what I'm talking about."
Beyond feeling disregarded by their team, some youth felt that the child
welfare system more generally discounts the notion that youth know
what is best for them. One youth asserted that they knew what was best
for them in terms of a permanent placement:
'I knew what was best for me, and I knew it was not going to [city]
and being put in some other random foster care with some people I
had no idea who they were. I don't do very well with strangers."
Yet another youth pointed to the power differential that youth
experience in foster care:
' .1 don't think that they think that anybody that is not an adult has
a very good opinion on what they need in life because they are adults
and they have been trained in this kind of thing, so obviously they
know best."
These results suggest that some practices created conditions that
youth experienced as coercive and dismissive, which failed to meet their
needs for autonomy and undermined their engagement in family
meetings.
4. Discussion
This research brought SDT's motivational lens to the process of
engaging youth in child welfare family case planning meetings. It also
centered youth's experience of family meeting practices and how they
functioned differently in creating conditions that supported their
engagement depending on the extent to which their needs for related-
ness, competence, and autonomy were met. Findings suggest that SDT is
consistent with other literature on youth involvement in family decision
), and adds value by offering an orga-
meetings (e.g.,
Cashmore, 2002
nizational framework for explaining why practices that create certain
conditions (warm and caring; structure and predictability; and sup-
portive of genuine preferences) can meet youth's basic psychological
needs and encourage their engagement in family meetings.
4.1. Three conditions that promote engagement
A key finding was that youth were more engaged in their family
6


C.J. Furrer et al.
meetings when they experienced warm and caring conditions. Indeed,
SDT suggests that warm and caring relationships support the funda-
mental need for relatedness, which in turn encourages engagement in
that context. This finding is consistent with previous research that points
to the importance of having trusted and caring adults who are seen as
allies (
Augsberger, 2014; Kennan et al., 2018; van Bijleveld et al., 2015)
It was found that having someone who knew and could advocate for the
youth helped them feel more willing to participate in meetings and
openly share their thoughts. Spending time getting to know LIFE team
members, both through regular family meetings and outside of meet-
ings, helped to build warm and caring relationships.
In contrast, when youth did not have a relationship or connection
with their LIFE team members, or if they experienced indifference or
rejection during their family meetings, their need for relatedness was
not met, which undermined their engagement. This finding extends the
current literature by suggesting that there are multiple pathways to a
youth's experience of warmth and care, and that a strategy that is sup-
portive for one youth may undermine another youth's experience. One
example is involving family members. For some youth, having family
members participate in family meetings created warm and caring con-
ditions, which met their need for relatedness. For other youth, having
family members participate led to conflict, which undermined their need
to connect and therefore their willingness to engage. As such, the sub-
jective experience of needs satisfaction, rather than a specific practice,
predicts engagement (
Ryan & Deci, 2008)
As a child welfare practice, LIFE meetings offered regular opportu-
nities to gather a team of people to share information in a clear and
transparent way, and develop a common understanding of goals and
plans. Meeting preparation and facilitation practices that created
structured and predictable conditions included having the informa-
tion needed to plan, act, and ultimately find permanent placements for
youth. Indeed, many youth participants experienced their need for
competence being met through meeting preparation and participating in
regular family meetings (see also
Augsberger, 2014; Merkel-Holguin
et al., 2020
). The importance of structure and predictability aligns
with characteristics of trauma-informed practice in social work (e.g.,
trust, safety, worker-client collaboration) (Knight, 2019; Levenson,
), as well as research suggesting that consistently implementing
2020
expectations and norms contributes to youth's experiences of safety and
reliability, comfort, and attention (
Giboney wall, 2022; Nealy-oparah &
Scruggs-Hussein, 2018)
From a youth empowerment perspective, including youth in their
family meetings counters a common narrative in child welfare about
protecting youth from information about their family, that they are too
young to understand what is happening, and that certain topics (e.g.,
legal or policy issues) may not be relevant or appropriate for youth to
hear (e.g.,
Dillon et al., 2015; Toros, 2021; van Bijleveld et al., 2015)
Beyond including youth, findings from the current study suggest that
protecting youth from or withholding information, at least for the older
youth interviewed, created conditions that thwarted their need for
competence and undermined their engagement in family meetings.
Moreover, family meetings that did not offer structured and predictable
conditions (e.g., lack of preparation, lack of transparency, demands or
pressure from family team members) also served to undermine youth's
engagement. Taken together, these findings imply that the challenge of
engaging youth in family meetings may be less about youth's ability to
be involved than it is about the willingness and capacity for adults to
engage youth (
Toros, 2021)
Last, youth often experienced LIFE meetings as youth-focused, rele-
vant to what they wanted to discuss, and as opportunities for them to
make choices or have some say over what was happening with their
family's child welfare case - all conditions that supported youth's
genuine preferences. Many youth also described having a LIFE team
that listened to them and responded in a timely manner by following
through on promises, fulfilling requests, and providing requested in-
formation. These practices created conditions that supported the youth ' s
Children and Youth Services Review 155 (2023) 107183
need for autonomy, which helped them feel more engaged in their
family meetings (see also Kennan et al., 2018; Pölkki et al., 2012) ThlS
finding is consistent with characteristics of trauma-informed practice,
empowerment and choice, which are intended to help clients experience
a sense of control and agency
(Levenson, 2020; Knight, 2019
). Previous
research similarly points to the need for caseworkers to use strategies
that make space to hear a youth's authentic voice, thereby addressing
the imbalance of power that youth experience in the child welfare sys-
Archard & Skivenes, 2009; Augsberger, 2014; van Bijleveld et al.,
tem (
2015)
The child welfare system, which encourages adults to quickly make
decisions for youth, makes it challenging for caseworkers to practice in
ways that support youth's need for autonomy. Indeed, youth inter-
viewed for this research described experiences when their LIFE teams
ignored their preferences, and made decisions on their behalf without
their input or an explanation for the thinking behind the decision.
Failing to educate youth about their permanency options consistently
undermined their need for autonomy. Despite these challenges, results
suggest that facilitators and LIFE teams found ways to support youth's
genuine preferences. This is consistent with research underscoring that
even in a mandatory child welfare environment, adults can create op-
portunities for youth participation and choice, and for youth to share
their ideas without fear of manipulation and pressure (Caffrey &
Browne, 2022)
4.2. Limitations
The power imbalance that youth in foster care experience in the child
welfare system can limit researchers in their ability to fully represent
their voices. Incorporating voice, through interviews for example, does
not automatically empower youth; rather, systemic issues, such as
power differences, can shape what youth in foster care say and their
ability to express themselves (
McGregor et al., 2019; Nybell, 2013) and
affect the research process (
). Despite the evaluation
Spyrou, 2011
team' s efforts to establish rapport with youth, it is likely that some youth
withheld information or selectively shared what they thought might be
more socially desirable during interviews. Moreover, a youth's famil-
iarity with the interviewer could have influenced what youth shared,
although it is challenging to know how it affected any given youth. For
example, having an interviewer observe their family planning meeting
could have helped build rapport with one youth, and it could have
contributed to another youth feeling embarrassed or uncomfortable
during their interview. As another example, six youth had follow-up
interviews and two interviews involved sibling pairs. Either of these
situations could have contributed (positively or negatively) to what
youth felt comfortable talking about during their interview. Other fac-
tors that could have influenced what a youth shared during their
interview include individual differences between youth (e.g., age,
gender, culture, family composition) and the extent of their experience
in the child welfare system.
Interviewees were unevenly distributed across the three child wel-
fare jurisdictions implementing LIFE. Participating youth were 12 years
old and older, English speaking, and predominantly white living in rural
areas. As such, our data may not be indicative of youth experiences
(particularly Black, Indigenous, and other Youth of Color) and child
welfare practices in other settings. Although the evaluation team
worked hard to recruit youth with varying levels of engagement in LIFE
services, those who were most disengaged or never participated in
family meetings, perhaps due to having more negative experiences with
child welfare, are not represented. Therefore, these findings likely lack
nuance about working to engage youth in instances when there is a need
to repair relationships or if the youth experienced harm resulting from
child welfare agency decisions (e.g.,
O' Keeffe, Martin, & Midgley,
2020)

4.3. Using a motivational framework in the context of child welfare
practice
Understanding how to constructively promote engagement is foun-
dational for casework. SDT explains that youth engagement reflects the
extent of an individual's needs fulfillment and offers various pathways
to facilitate engagement. As such, the results of this study have impli-
cations for child welfare practice as it pertains to youth engagement.
Knowing the importance of a youth's subjective experience, one key
implication for practice is that caseworkers need to spend time devel-
oping relationships with youth to learn about their needs and ways in
which they can strive to meet them (e.g.,
). It also
Ryan & Deci, 2008
suggests the importance of routinely asking youth for feedback to better
understand whether their needs are being met (
). Priori-
Crowe, 2007
tizing relationships in the child welfare system might also require
creating accountability structures for caseworkers (e.g., required face-
to-face contact) and shifts in resource allocations (e.g., lower case-
loads, reduced administrative burden) to allow caseworkers to spend
time doing this type of work (Gibson, Samuels, & Pryce, 2018)
A second key implication for practice is the need for caseworkers to
shift their thinking away from a compliance orientation toward a needs-
based approach to understanding youth engagement. SDT explains
that a youth whose basic needs are not being met might respond to their
caseworker by refusing to participate in family meetings, with ambiv-
alence, or by avoiding them. A caseworker with a compliance orienta-
tion might interpret these types of disaffected behaviors as
noncompliance or opposition, rather than as a signal of unmet needs
requiring additional support. This dynamic is similar to the assertion
that caseworkers who lack trauma-informed training might fail to
recognize youth's emotional and behavioral problems as trauma
symptoms (e.g., Conners-Burrow et al., 2013)
A third key implication for practice pertains to the need for case-
workers to both value and practice redistributing power with youth as
they navigate the child welfare system. Previous research has high-
lighted that when youth are empowered (i.e., autonomy is supported) to
participate in processes intended to protect them, their participation can
promote their well-being (Vis et al., 2011; van Bijleveld et al., 2015). As
we previously noted, youth involved in the child welfare system often
experience additional trauma, lack of access to needed supports and
services, and challenges to their basic right to participate in their fam-
ily's case planning. Caseworkers who lack the time, practice experience,
and skills to work with youth may unintentionally reinforce power dy-
namics that exist in the child welfare system (
Kosher & Ben-Arieh, 2020;
Pölkki et al., 2012
). On the other hand, caseworkers who understand
how to create conditions for youth to authentically engage in protective
processes, such as family case planning meetings, can also contribute to
youth well-being.
A final implication is the need for the child welfare system to
support caseworkers as they strive to do youth-centered casework. For
example, high caseloads and the focus on procedural tasks and paper-
work can be significant sources of burnout for caseworkers and get in the
way of the relational work that is necessary to promote engagement (e.
Leake, Rienks, & Obermann, 2017; Ferguson, 2017; Seim & Slettebø,
). Systemic issues, such as caseworker turnover and an organiza-
2017
tional culture that does not prioritize youth voice, are also barriers to
youth engagement work (Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2021)
Supportive organizational climates help caseworkers feel more engaged
in their work (e.g.,
Van den Broeck, Ferris, Chang, & Rosen, 2016)
which in turn promotes more positive long-term outcomes for youth
(Glisson & Green, 2011)
5. Conclusion
The child welfare system struggles to promote authentic youth
engagement. Trauma, lack of power, and other disadvantages experi-
enced by youth in foster care profoundly constrain their ability to
Children and Youth Services Review 155 (2023) 107183
identify and express their needs and wants. SDT suggests that engage-
ment reflects needs fulfillment, and therefore it is crucial that individual
youth's needs are understood. Of central importance for youth
engagement was the LIFE team's ability to recognize and authentically
respond to youth, and to hold space (which requires time, relationship-
building, and redistributing power) for youth with very little control
over their lives to discover and articulate what they need. Creating
conditions that encourage youth engagement in their family's case
planning meetings requires caseworkers to practice in ways that coun-
teract the power imbalance that youth face, as well as a commitment to
centering youth experiences and contributing to their overall well-being
and development. It also requires a child welfare system that creates
supportive conditions for its workforce.

Abstract
Background: Computerized clinical decision support (CDSS) —digital information systems designed to improve
clinical decision making by providers - is a promising tool for improving quality of care This study aims to
understand the uptake of ASMAN application (defined as completeness of electronic case sheets), the role of CDSS
in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery outcomes.
Methods: We have conducted secondary analysis of program data (government data) collected from 81 public
facilities across four districts each in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The data collected between
August —October 2017 (baseline) and the data collected between December 2019 — March 2020 (latest) was
analysed. The data sources included: digitized labour room registers, case sheets, referral and discharge summary
forms, observation checklist and complication format. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate and interrupted time
series regression analyses were conducted.
Results: The completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period (40.5%), and in facilities with
more than 300 deliveries a month (20 9%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the introduction of technology
yielded significant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices. We have observed reduction in fresh still
births rates and asphyxia, but these results were not statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis.
However, our analysis showed that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of
program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased.
Conclusions: Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care and delivery
outcome. Future studies with rigorous study design is required to understand the impact of technology in
improving quality of maternity care.

Usmanova et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Introduction
Globally, it has been proven that effective and quality of
care at the facility level, particularly around childbirth
and immediately after the birth, can significantly con-
tribute to the reduction of maternal deaths, stillbirths
and neonatal deaths [1, 2]. Over the last decades, efforts
in ensuring skilled birth attendance resulted in increased
institutional deliveries, this in turn moved higher pro-
portion of avoidable maternal and neonatal mortality to
health facilities [2]. Therefore, improving quality of care
around childbirth and immediately after birth is impera-
tive to prevent adverse outcomes for pregnant women
and new-borns [2].
In India, despite a tremendous increase in rate of insti-
tutional deliveries [3], maternal and neonatal deaths did
not show equivalent reduction [4] in the last decade. It
was found by few studies that the increase in the rate of
institutional deliveries was not matched with overall im-
provement in quality of maternity care [4—6]. Quality of
care is a multi-dimensional concept that incudes avail-
ability of evidence based guidelines, strengthened infra-
structure, resources, enabling environment, attitude of
health providers; all these in turn result in patients' and
providers' satisfaction and improved health outcomes
[2]. To address these issues the, Government of India
(GOI), launched the quality improvement initiative under
the name 'Dakshata' (means adroitness) [7], to build pro-
vider adherence to key evidence based clinical practices
during intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods.
Dakshata uses the World Health Organization's Safe
Childbirth Checklist (SCC) as a framework for
improving providers' competency. Although, Dakshata
intervention has not been evaluated, other quality of
intrapartum care improvement initiatives using SCC in
Rajasthan [8], Uttar Pradesh [9] and Karnataka [10]
demonstrated significant improvement in adherence to
evidence based clinical practices. Moreover, a study from
Rajasthan showed reduction in perinatal mortality,
which fell by 11% [11]. However, these studies detected
certain clinical practices that either did not improve sig-
nificantly (initiation of partograph, counselling on dan-
ger signs), or declined over 12 months' period (use of
SCC, administration of oxytocin soon after delivery).
Thus, it is imperative to identify and test innovative so-
lutions for improving quality of care in order to acceler-
ate reduction in maternal and neonatal death in India.
One such solution is computerized clinical decision sup-
port (CDSS) —digital information systems designed to
improve clinical decision making by providers — a prom-
ising tool for improving quality of care by improving ad-
herence to clinical guidelines [12, 13], practitioner's
performance [12, 14], patient outcomes [15—17], and
quality of clinical documentation [18], thus contributing
to quality improvement and overall efficiency of health

care delivery. While there is significant research on
CDSSs generally, but evidence of use of CDSS for mater-
nity care is limited. In rural health facilities in Burkina
Faso, Ghana and Tanzania, CDSS was not found to sig-
nificantly improve quality of antenatal and delivery care
[19]. A study conducted in South Africa showed that
CDSS lead to overall improvement in adherence to clin-
ical guidelines, but it was not statistically significant [20].
In Nigeria, McNabb et al., reported that decision support
via mobile phones led to significant improvement in
health counselling, technical services, quality of health
education and patient satisfaction [21].
ASMAN intervention
In this paper we describe the findings from implementa-
tion of "ASMAN" (The Alliance for Saving Mothers and
Newborns) a provider-focused package of interventions
that leverages technology to reduce maternal and early
neonatal mortality through the adoption of key tech-
nologies that improve capacity-building and service de-
livery efforts focused on the provision of quality care
during childbirth and the first 48—60 h after delivery.
The ASMAN project takes an integrated quality im-
provement approach:

and quality of care as per the established labour
room protocols and standards. For this purpose, the
project adopted GOI approved Dakshata training
package for building the capacity of service
providers. Post training follow up and on-site men-
toring were conducted by the program team to en-
sure translation of skills into practice.
Introduction of technology intervention to facilitate
timely and correct clinical decision-making by pro-
viders. For this purpose, ASMAN, an android based
application for electronic recording of intrapartum
and immediate postpartum care, integrated with
Clinical Decision Support, e-partograph, knowledge
enhancement and other features was introduced at
project sites. The ASMAN application runs on a
tablet stationed in several important areas of the
health facilities, including registration, triage, the
labor room, postpartum areas, operation theatre
and post-operative wards.
The ASMAN application had the following
components:
• Case management: Digitized case sheet from
admission until discharge with integrated clinical
rules (admission notes, e-partogram, Safe Childbirth


Usmanova et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Checklist, delivery notes, post-delivery monitoring,
post-natal care, discharge slip, referral slip, events
section, alerts & notifications).
• Dashboards and reports: System generated
dashboards and reports for respective health facility,
district and state level managers.
E-learning content: All Gol training modules,
guidelines and tutorials. Available in audio, video, or
readable format in English or in Hindi
ASMAN Complication Management Game: a case-
based game designed to improve management of
intrapartum and immediate postpartum/ postnatal
complications for developing critical thinking skills
of health workers around safe child delivery
• Safe Delivery App: which provides evidence-based
clinical guidelines on Basic Emergency Obstetric and
Neonatal Care
• Remote support center: staffed 24/7 by senior
residents at the medical college for provision of
support in cases of unclear management. Staff at the
remote support center have access to all cases
ASMAN program implementation took place across
81 public facilities in four districts each in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh states of India. The key stakeholders of
ASMAN were Governments of Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan. This project was piloted between June 2017
to May 2020, with support from Reliance Foundation,
Tata Trusts, MSD for Mothers, Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID). Jhpiego was the lead implemen-
tation agency. The respective state governments were
consulted to select specific intervention districts that
had higher neonatal and maternal mortality rates as
compared to the state average, districts without ongoing
intervention for improving quality of intrapartum and
postpartum care. Within those districts, government
health facilities that had a relatively high case load of 50
or more deliveries per month and therefore, greater need
for intervention, were selected.
This program implementation offered an opportunity
to evaluate the role of a CDSS in improving quality of
care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum
periods, assess its impact on delivery outcomes, identifi-
cation and referral of key maternal and neonatal compli-
cations in selected public facilities.
Methodology
Research aims
To our knowledge, no studies from India have described
the impact of CDSS on clinical outcomes during the
intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods. Along
with the lack of evidence on effect of CDSS in improving
quality of maternity care, this gap represents a crucial
Page 3 of 12
research priority for India with global relevance.
Through this analysis, we attempt to answer the follow-
ing questions:

What was the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers?
How did the ASMAN application affect adherence
to key clinical practices?
What was the trend of maternal (pre-eclampsia,
eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage) and neonatal
(fresh still births, birth asphyxia) complications
during the project implementation?
What was the trend of identification and referral of
maternal complications (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia,
postpartum haemorrhage) during the project
implementation?
Study design, and study setting
We have conducted secondary analysis of program data
(government data) collected from 81 public facilities
across four districts each in two states of Madhya
Pradesh (Jabalpur, Khargone, Ratlam and Vidisha) and
Rajasthan (Ajmer, Bhilwara, Kota and Jhalawar). This
de-identified dataset was provided by the government of
both states. The data collected between August —Octo-
ber 2017 was considered as a baseline and the data
collected between December 2019 — March 2020 was
considered as a latest assessment. The study was per-
formed in accordance with ethical principles outlined in
the World Medical Association (W MA) Declaration of
Helsinki [22] where privacy and confidentiality of per-
sonal information was assured by getting access to de-
identified data.
Study tools and data collection
The following tools were used to collect data:
• ASMAN application data- has digitized all labour
room registers, case sheets, referral and discharge
summary forms of Government of India. Every
woman who comes to any ASMAN facility for
delivery is registered in the application. All forms
are filled by the health providers at the 81 project
facilities in real time. Details from patient history,
labour room case sheets, partograph, until
discharge is collected in the ASMAN application.
We have used data from ASMAN application to
understand filling ratio at admission, delivery,
post-delivery, postnatal care (PNC) and discharge.
Data of all those women who had delivered at
ASMAN facilities and their newborns between
November 2017 and March 2020 in Rajasthan
and Madhya Pradesh states are used for this ana-
lysis. Till March 2020, data of 266,992 women


Usmanova et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
who delivered and 228,807 newborns were en-
tered in ASMAN application.
• The observation checklist was developed based on
WHO SCC [23] and was approved by GOI as part of
monitoring activities under Dakshata program [24].
This checklist was designed to measure adherence
to essential practices around childbirth. These
practices were divided by pause points: practices
that are necessary to perform on admission, just
before pushing (or before caesarean), soon after
birth (1 h) and before discharge. This tool was used
to explore adherence to practices at the baseline and
latest assessment periods. The program officers,
with medical background, collected this information;
the observation assessment on average took 2—4 h.
• Complication format: Maternal and New Born
Complications Identification and Referral
Monitoring System. Since, there is no formal
mechanism in the government systems to monitor
childbirth and new born related complication and
management, complication format was introduced
by ASMAN program team with the support from
the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
The complication reporting format captured data on
key maternal and newborn health indicators from
the labour room, postpartum ward, Sick Newborn
Care Unit (SNCU), admissions and discharge
department of the facility. This format captured data
on total deliveries, type of deliveries, fresh stillbirths,
preterm births, maternal and neonatal death,
maternal complications (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia,
sepsis, postpartum haemorrhage, sepsis), neonatal
complications (neonatal asphyxia and sepsis), refer
in and refer out data for maternal and neonatal
complications. One nodal person, preferably a
labour room staff, was selected from each
intervention facility to act as the key contact person
for this initiative and was validated regularly by
ASMAN program team. This tool was used to
explore effect of ASMAN application on delivery
outcomes.
Data analysis
To describe uptake of ASMAN application, we com-
puted the filling rates of 75 key data fields of the applica-
tion and analysed the differences by pause points, level
of health facility and average annual delivery load at the
health facilities.
To analyze the change in adherence to evidence based
practices after roll out of the intervention, we combined
the baseline assessment and last periodic assessment
data sets. For overall univariate analysis of adherence to
key clinical practices before and after comparison, we
computed means for before and latest intervention
Page 4 of 12
periods and compared them using chi square test. For
adherence to evidence based practices, we also per-
formed multivariable logistic regression analysis for each
practice while adjusting for level of facility, average de-
livery load at the facility and availability of resources re-
quired for each key practice.
To analyze trends in maternal and neonatal complica-
tions, and referrals we utilized the monthly complication
format data which was shared by all ASMAN interven-
tion facilities. As the intervention was rolled out in a
staggered manner at different time points across project
health facilities, we categorized the complication data of
each facility into two time periods corresponding to be-
fore and after intervention roll out.
Within each time period, we further grouped monthly
data into quarterly data (3 months' data), such that each
quarter represented a time interval relative to the inter-
vention roll out. For example, Q-1 and Q + 1 denoted
the periods corresponding to 3 months before and 3
months after intervention rollout respectively. The
month of intervention roll out together with subsequent
2 months were denoted as QO or quarter O or the time
interval corresponding to intervention roll out. Data of
corresponding quarters was combined for all facilities
and this dataset was used for generating simple time
series plots (line/bar) for analysing the trends before and
after intervention roll out.
Single group interrupted time series regression analysis
was performed on two dependent variables 1) fresh still
birth rate and 2) incidence of neonatal asphyxia. We
have conducted interrupted time series analysis for these
two outcomes as these were primary outcomes of the
intervention. Monthly data was utilized for carrying out
this analysis, yielding data for 12 time points before and
after intervention roll out respectively (M — 12 to M-1
before roll out and M + 1 to M + 12 after roll out). Coef-
ficients or parameters which represented a shift in the
level (intercept) of the dependent variable and a shift in
the rate of change (slope) of dependent variable, after
intervention, were computed along with 95% confidence
intervals. Newey west standard errors were utilized to
account for autocorrelation.
For all statistical tests of significance, p value < 0.05
was considered significant. We used Statistics package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 24, Stata version
14 and Microsoft Excel, for data analysis.
Results
Characteristics of facilities
Sixty-three percent of 81 intervention facilities were
community health centres. More than half of interven-
tion facilities had average monthly delivery load less than
100 (Table 1).

The analysis of filling ratio of ASMAN application re-
vealed that filling ratio was lowest at the PNC period
(40.5%), followed by admission (80.2%), discharge
(82.9%), post-delivery (93.1%) and delivery (93.7%)
(Table 3). Further, it was also found that filling ratio was
low in high delivery load facilities compare to low and
medium delivery load facilities (Table 2). However, fill-
ing ratio was not statistically significant by facility type
and by delivery load.
Adherence to key clinical practices
Table 3 illustrates providers' adherence to key clinical
practices across all pause points at the baseline and lat-
est assessment. In univariate analysis, statistically signifi
cant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices
was observed in 18 of 20 key clinical practices.
Page 5 of 12
Measuring birth weight and breastfeeding initiation were
the only practices that did not show statistically signifi
cant change in univariate analysis; both of these
practices were above 70% at the time of baseline assess-
ment. However, after adjusting for level of facility, aver-
age annual delivery load and resource availability all
clinical practices showed significant improvement (Table
3).
Delivery outcomes
Figure 1 depicts the trend of fresh still birth rates in
intervention facilities through the study period. There
was a steady decline through the period and the differ-
ence between mean still birth rate of four quarters
before intervention roll out and four quarters after inter-
vention roll out, was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
The interrupted time series regression analysis on
monthly data revealed that there was a decrease in fresh
still birth rate after intervention roll out [— 0.92 (95%
confidence interval: — 3.00 — 1.1.4)], though this change
was not statistically significant. The trend over time did
not change significantly either [0.12 (95% confidence
interval: — 0.13 — 0.38)] (supplementary file 1).
Figure 2 depicts the trend of neonatal asphyxia cases
(per 1000 live births) in intervention facilities through
the study period. There is a clear decline observed in
number of cases after ASMAN application roll out. The
difference between the mean number of cases in time
periods before and after application rollout, found to be
statistically significant (p < 0.05).
The interrupted time series regression analysis on
monthly data revealed that there was a decrease in num-
ber of neonatal asphyxia cases after intervention roll out
[— 3.12 (95% confidence interval: — 9.73 — 3.47)], though

this change was not statistically significant. The rate of
decline (slope) increased [— 0.36 (95% confidence inter-
val: — 1.09 — 0.36)], though this too was not statistically
significant (Additional file 1).
Maternal complications
Figure 3 illustrates the trend of pre —eclampsia /eclamp-
sia cases and refer out in intervention sites before and
after ASMAN application rollout. There is an increase in
identification of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia cases after
application roll-out, while referral out declined over the
same time period.
Analysis of postpartum haemorrhage cases and refer
out trends in intervention sites before and after ASMAN
application rollout revealed an increase in identification
of postpartum haemorrhage cases and decrease in refer-
ral out (Fig. 4).
Discussion
Our study described the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers, the role of ASMAN appli-
cation in improving adherence to key clinical practices,
delivery outcomes and maternal complications. We have
observed that, introducing ASMAN application resulted
in statistically significant improvements in adherence to
key clinical practices. However, overall completeness of
case sheets in ASMAN application was low across all
levels of facilities. We have observed reduction in fresh

On the other hand, our analysis showed that identifica-
tion of maternal complications has increased over the
period of program implementation and at the same time
referral outs decreased.
Uptake of ASMAN application
We have included completeness of case sheets in appli-
cation as a measure of data quality as it is a commonly
assessed dimension of data quality mentioned in a re-
view [25]. Although, using medical records has been
criticized for measuring quality of record keeping prac-
tices instead of quality of care, it was argued that patient
case records should be part of quality of care assessment;
because individual case records are essential not only for
case management and peer review but also for assessing
the impact of health interventions [26]. Additionally, it
was noted that clinical record keeping enables continuity
of care and improves communication between different
health providers [27].

Our results indicated that the filling ratio during the
post-partum period was low across all type of facilities.
The poor clinical documentation was reported in a re-
view of obstetric records conducted in India [28], with
the extent of documentation varying between 1.3% (as-
sessment of mother's condition at the discharge) and
99.1% (admission date). Similarly, a multicenter retro-
spective review of clinical records of cesarean delivery in
five low-income countries identified poor-quality record
keeping with missing information on key events, man-
agement of complications, and delivery outcomes [29].
Furthermore, we have found that the filling ratio across
all pause points was low at the district hospital level and
high delivery load facilities. In our qualitative study [30],
health care providers mentioned that staff shortage, pa-
tient urgency, high caseloads prevented staff to complete
all fields in the application. According to a study
conducted by Chaturvedi [28] and colleagues, Madhya
Pradesh state of India, documentation was better at dis-
trict hospitals due to higher qualification of the staff in
those facilities and availability of forms at the district
hospitals. Although, the present study did not conduct

comparison of documentation before and after ASMAN
application roll out, due to the unavailability of data be-
fore application rollout, respondents in our qualitative
study [30] reported that ASMAN application improved
documentation. Additionally, a study conducted in Aus-
tralian tertiary maternity facility [31] found that the use
of electronic health records resulted in significant im-
provements in completeness of data captured. Further-
more, it was noted by the same study that the data
captured electronically was easily available to providers
compare to paper based records. Understanding the rea-
sons for the low filling ratios at the PNC period would
require further research. The low filling ratio at facilities
with delivery load more than 300 could be explained by
bigger client -provider ratio could be reasons as per an-
ecdotal experience.
Adherence to key clinical practices
Our study revealed that quality of care across all pause
points improved during the implementation of ASMAN
application. Furthermore, labor room staff in the
1.8
qualitative study mentioned that ASMAN application
improved their ability to take a complete history and
physical exam, identify high-risk patients, manage cases
confidently, facilitate provider communication, improve
reporting processes, and ensure continuity of care for re-
ferral patients [30]. In our study we have observed that
examinations around identification and management of
complications, initiation of partograph, identification of
post-partum haemorrhage increased significantly. These
results indicate that ASMAN application has the poten-
tial to improve quality of care provided around the
childbirth. These are very encouraging results, as timely
identification of complications is crucial because over a
third of maternal deaths, a significant proportion of
pregnancy-related life-threatening conditions; approxi-
mately half of all stillbirths and a quarter of neonatal
deaths are attributed to complications that occur during
labour, childbirth or the immediate postpartum period
[32—34]. Our findings are in line with the results of three
systematic reviews on the role of CDSS use on providers'
adherence to clinical practices [12—14]. According to

Garg and colleagues [12], better performance of pro-
viders was observed in studies where users were auto-
matically prompted to use the systems compared with
studies in which users were required to actively initi-
ate the system. Additionally, the same review ob-
served better performance in studies in which the
trial authors also developed the CDSS software [12].
Moreover, a synthesis of high quality systematic re-
views [14] showed that the positive effect of CDSS
depends on the services which it was used; CDSS
positively impacted providers' performance in studies
on drugs ordering and preventive care measures.
Kawamoto et al., [13] identified four features strongly
associated with a decision support system's ability to
improve clinical practice—(a) decision support pro-
vided automatically as part of clinician workflow, (b)
decision support delivered at the time and location of
decision making, (c) actionable recommendations pro-
vided, and (d) computer based. Additionally, CDSS
should also provide periodic performance feedback,
request documentation of the reason for not following
system recommendations, and share decision support
results with patients.
While there are studies on benefits of CDSS in general,
there is very limited research on benefits of CDCC in
maternity care. Duysburgh et al., [19] did not find a sig-
nificant improvement in quality of antenatal and delivery
care with the use of CDSS assessed in Burkina Faso,
Ghana and Tanzania. They have concluded that, history
taking, counselling, health education, laboratory investi-
gations, and examination and monitoring of mothers
and newborns during childbirth were not performed ac-
cording to the standards. A study conducted in South
Africa for improving compliance of health care workers
with antenatal care guidelines found overall improve-
ment, but it was not statistically significant [20].
McNabb et al., reports significant improvement in health
counselling, technical services, quality of health educa-
tion and patient satisfaction as a result of a mobile
phone decision support during antenatal care in Nigeria
[21].
Furthermore, studies conducted in India on the role of
CDSS in the management of cardiovascular diseases [35]
and hypertension [36] demonstrated positive role of
CDSS in improving care, adherence to guidelines, coun-
selling and follow up with patients that resulted in blood
pressure reduction.
Delivery outcomes and maternal complications
Improved practices around childbirth have a potential to
prevent birth asphyxia and complications due to prema-
turity, which are some of the main causes of fresh still
births and early neonatal deaths [34, 34, 37]. Our results
revealed that there was a significant decrease in fresh
Page 9 of 12
still birth and asphyxia, however this decrease wasn't sta-
tistically significant in interrupted time series analysis.
These results are in line with the global evidence on the
lack of evidence of potential impact of CDSS on patient
outcomes [12—14, 37, 38]. Thus, according to the sys-
tematic review, majority of the studies assessed patient
outcomes often without adequate statistical power to de-
tect clinically important differences [12]. Jaspers and col-
leagues found only few studies on impact of CDSS on
patient outcomes, though many of these have been too
small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinic-
ally important effect [14]. Furthermore, a systematic re-
view and meta-analysis found that CDSS linked to
electronic health records did not detect statistically sig-
nificant reduction in morbidity and mortality [38].
The lack of statistically significant improvement in de-
livery outcomes could be attributed to the small sample
size and short follow-up periods which is not long
enough to assess the impact of CDSS on patient out-
comes [14].
During the course of the program implementation,
we have observed that identification of pre-eclampsia
is increased while referrals for the same conditions
decreased. This change could be attributed to the
improved assessment at the time of admission.
Moreover, we have observed the same trend in iden-
tification and referral of postpartum hemorrhage that
could be explained by increased administration of
oxytocin within 1 min of delivery.
Strengths and limitations
The results of our study contributes to the dearth of lit-
erature on the role of CDSS in maternity care. From the
onset of the program our team trained and worked
closely with the focal point in each facility to ensure
quality of data and timely reporting. Furthermore, as a
part of program implementation, all providers were
trained in distinguishing and reporting fresh still births.
Additionally, data reported from facilities were regularly
validated by our team. The availability of data before
and during the program implementation allowed us to
estimate the role of CDSS in improving quality of intra-
partum care and delivery outcomes. Our study has few
limitations. Firstly, it is possible that providers carried
out the patient management according to the standards
but didn't record it in application. Secondly, our assess-
ment involved direct observation of provider practices,
as a result potential Hawthorne effect would have hap-
pened. To minimize Hawthorne effect we trained our
project officers using standard observation checklist and
standard operating procedures. Lastly, due to utilization
of program data in our analysis, establishing causal claim
is limited.

Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides
and evidence on the role of technology to improve the
quality of intrapartum care and delivery outcomes in
India. However, the results of this study could be gener-
alized to another country with similar settings. Our
study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality
of intrapartum care and delivery outcome. Future studies
with rigorous study design are required to understand
the impact of technology in improving quality of mater-
nity care. These studies could provide evidence on redu-
cing the burden of maternal and neonatal death
attributable to inadequate quality of care in India and
globally.

Abstract: The objective of the present paper is to review how pregnant women over 35 years have been described in
previous research, and to review the risks associated with pregnancy in those of advanced maternal age. Computerized
searches of the Cinahl, PubMed, Medic and Cochrane Library databases were undertaken. Research articles in scientific
journals, relevant to the objective, and published in English between 2000 and 2008, were included. Data were extracted
based on the aims, sample, authors, year and results.
Results: Advanced maternal age is associated with certain pregnancy-related risks. Being "at risk" causes anxiety and
concern, which older pregnant women try to ease by being as well-informed as possible. This may be overwhelming to
some women due to the large amount of information available.
Conclusions: It is important for healthcare providers to be aware of the different feelings and experiences of older
pregnant women in order to meet their individual needs within the maternity services.
Keywords: Maternal age, risk, advanced maternal age.
INTRODUCTION
In developed countries, such as Finland and Sweden,
childbearing later in life is a phenomenon which has become
increasingly evident in the last three decades [1]. For
example, in Finland in 1997, 8.3% of primigravida women
were over 35 years old. By 2007, this had increased to 10.4%
[2]. The situation is closely comparable with Sweden, where,
in 2007, 10% of primigravidas were 35 years of age or older
[3]. In 2007, 19.2% of all women giving birth in Finland
were over 35 years old, whereas the figure in 1997 was
The risks related to pregnancy in those over 35 years old,
especially primiparity, can be understood from two
perspectives: first, the actual medical risks, and second, the
acceptability of the risks as defined through social discourse
among different groups within society [4]. Medical risks are
related to an ageing reproductive system and an ageing body,
whereas social discourse prescribes the way in which older
pregnant women are regarded as mothers, and when it is
"considered" that women "should have" children [4]. It has
been said that pregnant women and healthcare providers
understand the risks differently: pregnant women evaluate
the risks subjectively, through their own experiences,
whereas healthcare providers assess the risks in an
apparently more objective way [5].
Advanced maternal age (AMA) is seen by patients and
healthcare professionals, to be correlated with poorer
outcomes to pregnancies. This is largely because of the
higher incidence of chronic medical conditions among older
women. Women of AMA are often treated as if they are in
need of the level of care necessary for any high-risk

pregnancy; and they are treated differently even if there is no
scientific basis for different treatment and there are no
medical problems evident [6]. However, pre-existing and
pregnancy-related morbidity, combined with high maternal
expectations, does put these women in greater need of
intervention during pregnancy and birth [6]. Despite the
perceptions of increased risks related to AMA, it has been
suggested that the risks are manageable and positive
outcomes can be expected [7].
In recent years, several reviews concerning pregnant
women aged 35 years or older have been conducted, which
have focused on: the risks associated with AMA [8]; the
relationship between AMA and pregnancy outcomes [7, 9];
the evidence of risks faced by women of AMA [10]; and the
association between maternal age and still-birth [11]. Fewer
studies have focused on women's own experiences of later
childbearing and age-related pregnancy risks. The purpose of
the present review article is to provide an overview of how
previous research has described pregnant women aged over
35, and what the pregnancy risks related to AMA are.
DATA AND METHODS
Research articles for this review were retrieved from
searches of the Cinahl, PubMed, Medic and Cochrane
Library databases. Keywords used in the search were
"Maternal age 35 and over" and "advanced maternal age".
The assistance of an information specialist librarian was used
to confirm the adequacy of keywords used in the search
terms. The search was limited to the period between 2000
and 2008, in order to focus on the most recent information
available. We searched for original research articles
reporting studies conducted using qualitative or quantitative
methods, and which had been published in English. Other
review articles were omitted from the present review.
Studies focusing on both primi- and multiparous women
were included.

Searching Cinahl with the keywords "maternal age 35
and over" returned 66 references; searching PubMed with
"maternal age over 35" returned 316, and with "advanced
maternal age" 425 references. Searching the Medic and
Cochrane Library databases provided no relevant references.
Following retrieval, the first phase of the review process
involved reading through the titles of all 807 references, in
order to delete references from the selection, based on the
exclusion criteria listed below. In the second phase, abstracts
of all the remaining, non-excluded references were read
through.
The exclusion criteria were: 1) the topic was irrelevant to
the objective of this study; 2) there was no abstract available;
3) the study was focused on only a particular medical
problem related to pregnancy in older women, for example
genetic
screening, amniocentesis, trisomies,
foetal
abnormalities,
different medical
conditions,
or
developmental disorder with the foetus; 4) the study referred
to postpartum and maternity issues; and 5) the full research
article was unobtainable with reasonable effort.
In the third phase, when the final selection of articles had
been made, all available full-text versions of the selected
articles were read through. A further manual search of cited
references in the selected research articles was also made,
using the same exclusion criteria mentioned above. This
provided two more articles for inclusion in the present
review. PubMed produced five and Cinahl eight relevant
research articles, so that finally, a further 15 articles were
included in the analysis (Table 1).
Qualitative studies were examined using content analysis.
This inductive analysis revealed certain themes and subjects
within the selected articles, which addressed the research
questions, and which could finally be grouped together
thematically. Quantitative studies, which were mainly
focused on the medical risks associated with AMA, and
which had been analysed statistically, were analysed in the
present review by collating common subject areas, and
grouping them together thematically with the articles from
the papers describing qualitative studies.
RESULTS
Women's Knowledge of Pregnancy-related Risks and
their Decisions concerning the Timing of Childbearing
The knowledgability of older pregnant women
concerning pregnancy-related issues has not been the focus
of many studies: we found only three research articles that
described women's knowledge of pregnancy risks related to
delayed childbearing, and their knowledge base for making
decisions about the timing of motherhood [12-14]. These
studies revealed that women were well aware of the age
related decline in fertility [12-14], but they relied on the
expectation of the assistance of reproductive technology
being available if needed [12, 13]. Some researchers found
that women recognized there to be a higher likelihood of an
older mother giving birth to a baby with Down's syndrome
[13, 14] and of there being a greater risk of miscarriage, and
having high blood pressure [13]. However, the probabilities
of needing to deliver by Caesarean section [13, 14], having a
premature or low-birth-weight baby, stillbirth [14] or of
Lampinen et al.
multiple births, were not as well identified [13, 14]. It has
been suggested that neither women nor men fully recognize
the link between increased maternal age and the
developmental and health related risks of low birth weight or
pre-term infants [14]. Moreover, both men and women lack
knowledge concerning conception, pregnancy complications,
and infant outcomes as related to delayed childbearing [14].
In general, both men and women should be much better
informed about the complications and declining fertility
associated with a first pregnancy at an AMA [15].
Few studies discussed the timing of childbearing.
Maheswhari et al. (2008) found that sub-fertile women
thought 40 and 45 years more acceptable as an age at which
to become a first-time mother, than pregnant women did.
Another study revealed that, while most women were
satisfied with their decisions of postponing childbearing,
women of 35 years of age and older would, in retrospect,
have started having children earlier in life [12]. A stable
relationship, education and developing a career before
having a family, influenced women's decisions concerning
the timing of childbearing [12]. Financial security and their
partner's suitability to be a parent were also important
factors [12, 14]. In addition, women described having a
feeling of "a biological clock ticking away", which affected
their decisions concerning the timing of motherhood [12].
Information Gathering and Women's Preparation for
Pregnancy
Issues related to a woman's preparation for pregnancy
were described in five studies [4, 13, 16, 17, 18]. These
indicated that being well-prepared for pregnancy seemed to
be a characteristic more typical of older pregnant women.
Being considered "at risk" causes women anxiety, which
they try to ease by preparing themselves for pregnancy and
seeking information. Carolan (2007a) showed that women
aged over 35 years approached pregnancy as a project which
should be preceded by a stage of careful planning. These
women described their main health concerns as the
likelihood of foetal genetic problems or maternal
complications during pregnancy e.g. gestational diabetes,
postpartum depression, multiple births or miscarriage [16].
Prior to conception older women also prepared
themselves for pregnancy both mentally and physically.
Such preparation often meant losing weight, going on diets
and taking exercise [17]. Some women visited specialist
doctors to discuss existing health issues, such as blood
pressure [17]. Choosing hospitals and birth-care options was
another way in which women prepared for pregnancy, and
being aware of the increased risks associated with their age,
they especially valued the availability of emergency services
at hospitals [17]. Having become pregnant, women adopted a
different range of health promoting activities in response to
their concerns and needs in relation to their pregnancy.
These activities included following a healthy lifestyle and
taking special care of their nutritional status [16].
Women also approached pregnancy by searching for
information from multiple sources, which they sometimes
found offered contradictory advice [16, 17]. Women
searched for information from the internet, journal articles,
childbirth educators, and hospital telephone information

Results
Levels of amniocentesis, ceasarean section, assisted
delivery, induction and augmentation were all higher
among older women. Maternity service use also
increases significantly with age.
Independence, a stable relationship, and declining
fertility influenced women's decisions about timing of
motherhood.
Four risk-related themes: realizing the status "at risk",
hoping for reassurance, dealing with uncertainty, and
getting through it/negotiating risk.
Percentage of mothers approached childbearing as a
major project in their lives. Project progressed through
clearly defined stages of: information gathering,
planning and preparing and finishing up tasks prior to
the birth.
Mothers were found to have access to large volumes of
health information. Midwives and maternal and child
health nurses revealed a tendency to provide older first-
time mothers with considerable health information of a
medical orientation, understanding that this is what the
women required.
Increasing age was significantly associated with
miscarriage, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital
anomalies, gestational diabetes, placenta previa and c-
section.
Perinatal death, intrauterine fetal death, and neonatal
death increased with age. Also intercurrent illnesses
and pregnancy complications increase with increasing
age.
Pregnant women aged 35 or older are at increased risk
of complications in pregnancy compared with younger
women.
Older women were more likely to have hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, placental abruption, or placenta
revia, but they were less likely to be nulliparous and to
smoke. Also preterm birth and small for gestational age
rates were higher.
Despite awareness of the impact
of age on fertility, 85% of the subfertile group expected
IVF to overcome the effects of age compared with 770/0
of the pregnant population. Knowledge about age-
related obstetric risks, such as trisomy 21, was similar
in both groups (86.3% vs 85%). Almost all participants
(94.5%) believed that women should be informed about
the implications of delaying childbearing at an early
age.
This study emphasises the increased maternal and fetal
risks for pregnancies at these extreme age groups in a
retrospective way.
Older primigravidas took more time in antenatal
consultations. No significant difference was found
between the groups of women, although a small
number in both groups were very anxious.

networks [16]. Carolan (2007a & b) found that career-
oriented, educated women, preferred information written for
a medical and midwifery audience, rather than popular
reading material such as magazine articles. Carolan (2007b)
also found that pregnant women over 35 years old
sometimes felt they had too much information concerning
age-related pregnancy risk and foetal disorders, which made
them anxious and made it difficult for them to focus on
positive outcomes. However, these women still wanted to be
as fully-informed as possible [4, 18].
In one study, Carolan (2007b) found that healthcare
providers gave a lot of medically-oriented information to
pregnant women aged over 35, presuming that this was what
these older, educated women needed and wanted. However, the
recipients found such information to be more overwhelming
than empowering, and midwives, and maternal and child health
nurses found it quite challenging to provide the right level and
type of advice to these women [18]. However, although these
women felt themselves to be over-informed, which increased
their concerns [18], they still thought that information about the
risks and benefits of delayed childbearing should be provided,
and that the ideal time would have been at an age when they
were in their early 20s [13].
Manifestation of Risks and Women's Experiences of
Risks, Pregnancy and Care
It has been shown that AMA increases pregnancy-related
risks and the probability of obstetric complications. Six
studies described the risks, complications and obstetric
outcomes related to pregnancy in women aged over 35 years
[19-24].
Compared to younger women, the types of complications
that women over 35 years are at increased risk of during
pregnancy include gestational diabetes, placenta praevia [20-
22], pre-eclampsia [21, 24], miscarriage [20] and pregnancy-
induced hypertension [21] as well as Caesarean sections [20,
21, 23]. Induction of labour [19, 21, 23], augmentation with
primiparae and assisted deliveries are also associated with
women of AMA [19]. Perinatal mortality, perinatal and
neonatal death, and intra-uterine foetal death also increase
with increasing age [21]. Older women are also more likely
to have been diagnosed with conditions such as hypertensive
disorders, diabetes mellitus and other chronic diseases, for
which they are already taking medication [19-21, 23]. These
chronic medical conditions may further complicate their
pregnancies [24].
However, some risks should be interpreted with caution
[20]. Bell et al. (2001) found that age-related increased
intervention rates were
independent of maternal
complications during pregnancy, complications during
labour, a history of infertility, and other confounding factors.
Age alone was not responsible for gestational hypertensive
disorders, although chronic hypertension was found to be
more common among women of advanced maternal age
[20]. Adverse outcome rates were in fact higher among older
women, even when there were no complications in their
pregnancies [23]. Interestingly, the increased occurrence of
pre-existing diagnoses or complications among older women
was not related to the increased risk of an adverse perinatal
outcome [21]. Despite the fact that increased risk with
increasing age has been clearly demonstrated, studies
suggest that, overall, pregnancy outcomes are favourable
because perinatal death is such a rare event, even with AMA
mothers [20, 21, 23].
Being "at risk" is not always obvious to pregnant AMA
women. Carolan and Nelson (2007) showed that AMA
women who were in good health during pregnancy, were
surprised to learn that they were in fact, classified in a high
risk category due to their age. As already stated, knowing
themselves to be in a high risk group can have a negative
impact on older pregnant women, causing them additional
concern and leading them to seek higher levels of health
monitoring during pregnancy [4]. Zasloff et al. (2007) found
that women over 35 years were more worried about the baby
compared with younger women. However, knowing
themselves to be "at risk" does not necessarily prevent the
natural positive feelings of pregnancy from being
experienced, although older women do seem to need to be
reassured more often that everything is well [4]. Pregnant
women 35 years of age or older often wanted additional
ultrasonic scans and genetic testing to be assured that
nothing was wrong [4]. Robb et al. (2005) found no


A Review of Pregnancy in Women Over 35 Years of Age
correlation between maternal age and emotional distress in
primigravidas when comparing pregnant women aged 35 and
over to those aged 20-30 years. Feelings during pregnancy
were mainly positive or anxious, described using phrases
such as being 'delighted', 'overjoyed' and 'extremely lucky'
or 'worried' about the baby [25]. AMA women also
appreciated the support received from healthcare providers
during the genetic testing process [16].
Carolan and Nelson (2007) found that although AMA
women were generally pleased with the care received, they
considered healthcare providers' attitudes towards their
concerns to be somewhat insensitive and dismissive. Older
pregnant women also expressed a need for more time for
discussion during maternity care visits [25]. Robb et al. (2005)
again highlighted the importance of healthcare providers being
aware how the concept of risk is assimilated by AMA mothers,
since the apparent over-concern of health care professionals
towards maternal and foetal well-being, can increase the stress
levels of pregnant women. Older pregnant women also benefit
from being given some favourable or positive information
related to delayed childbearing and motherhood as the
reassurance derived from this decreases stress [4]. Women over
35 years did not generally have negative feelings about the
forthcoming birth of their children, but they did find childbirth a
more difficult experience compared with younger women [15].
DISCUSSION
In the Western world, the average age at which first time
mothers give birth is continually rising [15]. Complications and
risks associated with pregnancy among women of AMA have
been addressed in numerous studies from different viewpoints,
mostly focusing on the medical risks associated with higher
maternal age. The purpose of this review was to profile how
women over 35 years and the associated pregnancy-related risks
have been described in previous research.
Studies examined in this review have shown an increased
likelihood of certain medical complications among women
of AMA. However, when exploring the risks associated with
AMA, it is important to consider the influence of
confounding variables such as marital status, economic
status, smoking, parity, BMI, pre-existing diagnoses, history
of using medications before conception, and previous
adverse prenatal outcome [20, 23].
While the experiences and knowledge of the older
pregnant woman are described in the present review, the role
of a father and family is not covered. Although it was not in
the search terms for this review, it appears to be a subject
area that has not been well addressed in the literature; thus,
how fathers experience later childbearing is not well-known.
Most studies reviewed here focused on the association
between AMA and its related risks, while only a few focused
on the experiences of pregnancy in general.
In summary, during pregnancy, women over 35 years
prepare for pregnancy, gather information, receive
information from healthcare providers, and worry about their
pregnancy and their status of being "at risk". Nevertheless,
these women also experience positive feelings. One of the
major difficulties to address is that while these women want
to be as well-informed and prepared as possible, the
information they receive can cause more anxiety rather than
alleviate their concerns [4, 17, 18, 25]. There are, therefore,
The Open Nursing Journal, 2009, Volume 3 37
challenges for maternity care workers to understand the
importance of a holistic approach, which takes into
consideration the individual, physical, emotional, and social
needs of older childbearing women [10].
Included in the present review are studies that were
conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The
original data varied from responses to small qualitative
interviews, to large data sets obtained from birth certificates or
other archived records. The majority of the studies reviewed
here were carried out in the USA, Canada, UK and Australia;
but interestingly, among these, the number conducted in nursing
science was relatively small. Although the phenomenon of later
childbearing is common in developed countries, an analysis of
the experiences of pregnant women in Europe is still needed in
order to determine the most suitable ways in which maternity
care should be structured to meet the individual needs of AMA
women.
This review is limited to the small number of relevant
studies that the literature search, which focused on advanced
maternal age, was able to retrieve. Although AMA is
associated with increased pregnancy-related risks and other
complications, by excluding these and other specific search
terms, the search results may have been constrained.
However, the principal aim was to gather information
specifically on older pregnant women, for which purpose the
terms used in the search were relevant, and verified by a
specialist librarian. The search terms used should have
returned literature that encompassed the specific risk issues
related to AMA; but they may not necessarily have done so.
As already stated, the number of studies included in this
review was quite small. This was partly due to the fact that
all studies relating to either postnatal issues, or to specific
medical problems associated with pregnancy in older
women, were excluded. Any literature not published in
English would also have been excluded from the search. It
may be fair to criticise the exclusion criteria used for the
present review, however, the studies that were finally
included formed quite a diverse selection, and the overall
breadth of issues covered in them means that the conclusions
that can be drawn from the present review are valuable,
relevant and usable.
It is important to remember that most women of AMA
give birth, at term, without experiencing adverse maternal or
prenatal outcomes [20]. Furthermore, the fact that absolute
rates of prenatal mortality/morbidity are low, suggests that
the majority of older women do have a desirable outcome to
their pregnancy [23]. The level of information provided to an
AMA woman, concerning the risks that similar women
might experience during pregnancy, and the manner in which
such information is given during maternity care, should
depend on her health status, her existing knowledge, and her
need for information. This requires careful judgement by a
sensitive, communicative healthcare professional, who is
able to develop a good patient-provider interaction, and who
can allow and make available sufficient time for discussion.
Older pregnant women must be made aware of the risks
related to later childbearing, in order that they might be able
to make informed decisions about whether or not to become
pregnant; but they should also be made aware of the
probability of successfully reach full term and of having a
completely problem-free pregnancy and birth.


38 The Open Nursing Journal, 2009, Volume 3
CONCLUSION
Pregnant women over 35 years old, have issues and
concerns to which healthcare providers must pay attention
when in professional contact with these women. In order to
meet the needs of older pregnant women, healthcare
providers themselves, need more information concerning the
experiences of older women during pregnancy, in order to
increase their understanding and knowledge of age-related
pregnancy risks. Healthcare providers should remember that
pregnancy can evoke a broad range of feelings in women of
advanced maternal age, which can vary from happiness to
anxiety.
This review illustrates the importance of the nature of
available information, and how it is given to older pregnant
women. Older pregnant women have a desire for knowledge
and they are active information seekers. Information given
by healthcare providers is, therefore, important for older
pregnant women during their process of becoming mothers.
It is especially important that each woman of AMA should
be treated as an individual, and not simply as a member of a
certain group. Being aware of the diverse experiences of
older pregnant women can help healthcare providers to
understand better the needs of these women. Such awareness
can also help health care providers to realize that it is
important to offer AMA women not only risk-oriented
information, but favourable information concerning later
childbearing as well. In order to be a successful healthcare
provider, they should consider their own, personal and
individual way of approaching older pregnant women, as
well as being up-to-date and well informed of all the risks
related to AMA.
More studies, involving larger samples are needed in
order to define the actual risks during pregnancy, and the age
to which the term "advanced maternal age" could properly
be used. It has been shown that there is an inconsistency in
the literature between the definition of, and the risk
assessment of, the older pregnant woman [26]. In addition,
healthcare providers' perceptions and experiences of caring
for women of AMA, would also be an invaluable resource if
it were to be documented. Healthcare providers would then
be able to find out how other members of their profession
have managed the wide range of situations that occur when
in contact with older pregnant women.

Abstract Recent upsurge of social working couples, low income levels of welfare support for children, etc. As the country
expanded, most of the home by parents entrust their children to kindergarten or preschool child's growth, education, and has
commissioned. As a result, shipments of kindergarten children or helping with school bus accidents occur frequently in and
out, and also a national problem of low birth rate due to the increase in child or family members, including two children
and their children too much attention on the increase due to the obese children that is no drill. Thus, children in the park in
order to maintain a safe and healthy life, safety and growth of children by building management systems with their parents
and their teachers hayeogeum park comfortably and safely establish a system to manage children hayeoteum.
I . Introduction
A Children in govemment health care continues to rise,
many govemment policies, such as obesity management are
suggested. However, the management of this series is
entirely parent or the kindergarten, nursery school teacher's
duty of care of business due to a unique addition to the
existing restaurant that is more burdened. Childhood
obesity-related youth (2-18 years) when the prevalence of
obesity in 1998 to 9.1% from 8.5% in 2009 has shown an
increasing phenomenon. In addition, the relationship
between the park with a large number of children living
disease caused by a large number of children is expected
to spread, and also as a kindergarten school bus accidents
is steadily and rapidly. School children and the vehicle in
front of the house before you alTive to pick you and your
child must be pre-waiting, and waiting for the vehicle to
inclement weather has been caused inconvenience.
Therefore, these social problems and to manage and protect
children from parents and teachers while reducing the
workload of infants comfortably and safely manage the
introduction of a system that can be kept safe and
comfortable life in the system was applied.
Applying such a system to spread ETRI (Korea
Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute)
oversees the competent authorities, Gyeongnam Techno
Park, with the participation of the "intelligent home
network, the construction of industrial infrastructure" was
perfomed. Heating company in Techno Park, Kyungnam

Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDPs) are no longer seen as "transitory diseases cured by delivery." It accounts for up to
50% of maternal deaths. Information concerning HDPs is less in developing countries like Ghana. This study was conducted to
find out the prevalence, awareness, risk factors, control, and the birth outcomes of HDPs. This was a retrospective cohort
study conducted among pregnant women seeking care in selected health facilities in the Ashanti Region. Data on
demographics, HDPs, and its associated birth outcomes were collected. Logistic regression models were used to examine the
association of the independent variables with HDPs. The burden of HDPs was 37.2% among the 500 mothers enrolled with
chronic hypertension superimposed with preeclampsia accounting for 17.6%, chronic hypertension, 10.2%, and preeclampsia
6.8% whilst gestational hypertension was 2.6%. It was observed that 44% (220) of the mothers had excellent knowledge on
HDPs. Oral nifedipine and methyldopa were frequently used for HDP management, and it resulted in a significant reduction
in HDP burden from 37.2% to 26.6%. Factors that influenced the increased risk of HDPs were grand multigravida
(AOR = 4.53; CI = 1.42—14.42), family history of hypertension (AOR = 3.61; CI= 1.89—6.90), and the consumption of herbal
preparations (AOR = 2.92; CI= 1.15—7.41) and alcohol (AOR = 4.10; CI= 1.34-12.62) during pregnancy. HDPs increased the
risk of preterm delivery (AOR = 2.66; CI = 1.29—5.89), stillbirth (AOR= 12.47; CI = 2 72—57.24), and undergomg caesarean
section (AOR = 1.70; CI = 1.10—2.61) amongst mothers during delivery. The burden of HDPs is high amongst pregnant
mothers seeking care in selected facilities. There is the need for intensified campaign on HDPs in the Ashanti Region of Ghana.
1. Background
Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDPs) are the leading
cause of maternal mortality [1]. It contributes to 14% and
16% maternal mortality worldwide and in Sub-Saharan
Africa (SSA), respectively [2]. Chronic hypertension, pre-
eclampsia-eclampsia, gestational hypertension, and chronic
hypertension-superimposed preeclampsia are the four cate-
gories of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy [3]. In Ghana,
it is estimated that the maternal mortality rate is 319 deaths
per 100,000 live births [4]. This is about 4.3 times higher
than the UN recommended rate. One of commonest cause


2
of direct maternal death identified was severe preeclampsia/
eclampsia which accounted for 23% of all direct maternal
deaths and 16% of all maternal deaths in 2011 [5].
Factors such as educational level, age, higher parity,
occupation, family of HDPs, gravida, complications of preg-
nancy, and others such as healthcare systems and social, cul-
tural, and economic factors are seen to be associated with
HDPs [6]. Studies have shown that a woman's knowledge
about her condition can influence early health seeking
behaviour and compliance to treatment which would result
in early diagnosis and prevent pregnancy complication
including death [7]. Lack of knowledge on HDPs could lead
to misconceptions which may include interpretation of
warning signs as normal occurrence during pregnancy or
as "spiritual attacks" [8]. Although maternal serum AQP9
concentrations have been found to be associated with
early-onset preeclampsia [9], the cause of HDPs remains
unclear, and treatment remains symptomatic with the pri-
mary objective being the safety of the mother. Over the
years, HDPs have being controlled with regular blood pres-
sure monitoring, use of approved pharmacotherapeutics,
and other nonpharmacological preventive measures.
Target 3.1 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)
as set by the United Nations is aimed at reducing the mater-
nal mortality ratio to 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030 [10].
However, the burden of hypertension has been increas-
ing over the past few decades in SSA, and a large percentage
of the population with hypertension remains untreated, inef-
fectively treated, or even undiagnosed [11]. Furthermore,
this study is important because much research has studied
the prevalence, awareness, and control of hypertension
among the general population; however, there is a need for
studies focused on pregnant women as the effect of HDPs
include risk of harm not only to the mother but also to the
unborn child. HDPs are no longer seen as "transitory dis-
eases cured by delivery," but as windows into the woman's
future health that needs integrated care, coordinating treat-
ment to identify risk factors and correct them [12]. This
study is aimed at identifying the prevalence, risks awareness,
control, and the birth outcomes of HDPs among pregnant
women in some selected health facilities in the Ashanti
Region of Ghana.
2. Methods
2.1. Study Design and Site. This was a retrospective cohort
study, which employed a well-structured, pretested, close-
response questionnaire to obtain data from pregnant women
who were seeking care at four hospitals in the Ashanti
Region. The Ashanti Region is the second most populous
region in Ghana (GSS 2019) with over 100 hospitals, both
private and public hospitals. The study sites included the
Ejisu Government Hospital (Ejisu Municipal), Kwame
Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST)
Hospital (Oforikrom Municipal), Kumasi South Hospital
(Asokwa Municipal), and the Komfo Anokye Teaching
Hospital (KATH) (Kumasi Metropolis, Bantama sub-metro
district). These facilities were chosen because of their loca-
Journal of Pregnancy
tion in the region and the large coverage of patients they
cater for.
2.2. Sample and Sampling. This study included pregnant
women above the ages of 18 years who had been admitted
for delivery and those who had delivered at the hospital dur-
ing the period of the study. Pregnant women who were on
admission for other reasons besides delivery were excluded.
At a significance level of 5%, the Yamane method was
used to determine the sample size [13]. The estimated num-
ber of live births in the Ashanti Region in 2010 was 122878
[14]. If the number of live births equals the number of preg-
nant women for the year, a sample size of 440 pregnant
women would be suffcient. Considering nonresponse rate,
a minimum of about 500 pregnant women were recruited.
From this figure, 105 (21%), 125 (25%), 120 (24%), and
150 (30%) mothers were recruited from the Ejisu District
Hospital, KNUST Hospital, Kumasi South Hospital, and
KATH, respectively. Employing quota, sample size for each
facility was determined using the documented average
monthly delivery at each hospital.
Consented participants were screened for eligibility. Par-
ticipants who were eligible for this study were numbered and
randomly sampled using an online number generator. Par-
ticipants whose numbers were generated were included in
the study.
2.3. Development and Validation of Questionnaire. The
questionnaire was developed after reviewing several litera-
tures to ensure that the items capture a meaningful construct
to have causality to the outcome of interest. The question-
naire was piloted within a selected hospital. To assess the
reliability of the construct of composite variables such as
the level of knowledge, a Cronbach alpha test was con-
ducted. For the Cronbach alpha test for level of knowledge,
the score was 0.73 which indicates that the composite vari-
able is reliable. Information was collected on their socio-
demographic characteristics, factors influencing their risk
of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, level of awareness,
management of the disorders, and the birth outcomes.
The level of knowledge was assessed as an 18-item com-
posite variable. For a correct response a code of 1 was
assigned, and for a wrong response, a code of O was assigned.
Therefore, a participant can score a maximum of 18 and a
minimum of O. Where a participant scores less than 5, and
then, the participant has poor level of knowledge, scoring
between 5 and 9 was considered satisfactory level of knowl-
edge, and 10 to 14 was considered good level of knowledge.
A participant is considered to have an excellent level of
knowledge on HDPs if the participant scores 15 to 18.
Code of 1 was assigned to participants who had HDPs
and O to participants who did not have evidence of HDPs.
Thus, the dependent variable hypertensive disorder in preg-
nancy was measured as a binary outcome.
2.4. Data Collection. A research team comprising medical
offcers, pharmacists, pharmacy house offcers, research sci-
entists, and midwives was formed and oriented through
series of meetings on the procedures and the objectives of

Cl = 1.06-2.46) (Table 6).
In addition to the birth outcomes of the study, it was
realized that mothers who were diagnosed of HDPs were
12.47 times more likely to have stillbirth during delivery
compared to mothers who were not diagnosed of HDPs
(AOR= 12.47; CI = 2.72—57.24). Other predictors such as
maternal age, anxiety over pregnancy, history of chronic
medical condition, and consumption of alcohol did not
influence the risk of stillbirth amongst mothers (Table 7).
4. Discussion
Hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (HDPs) have been
established to be a leading cause of maternal deaths,
accounting for about 26.4% to 50% of all maternal deaths
in the country [15]. In a study conducted in a teaching hos-
pital in Ghana in 2017, the burden of HDPs was found
21.4% which is about two times the global burden [16]. With
a national maternal mortality of 776 in 2020 [17], it was esti-
mated that up to 388 maternal deaths in Ghana were caused
by hypertensive disorders.
The burden of HDPs in this study was 37.2%, and 62.8%
of the participants had no HDPs, which is comparable to a
study by Awuah et al. [18], in which the burden of HDPs
was 39.25% and the proportion of women without HDPs
was 60.7%. Although the sample size was less compared to
this study, the prevalence of gestational hypertension and
preeclampsia were high compared to chronic hypertension
in pregnancy. Awuah recorded 52% and 33% for preeclamp-
sia and gestational hypertension, respectively, against 6.8%
and 2.6% in this study. Another study which was conducted
in a tertiary hospital in the Ashanti Region also recorded a
prevalence of 32.4% and 48.8% for gestational hypertension

and preeclampsia, respectively [19]. A systematic review of
HDPs in Ethiopia pooled a national prevalence of 6.07 with
subgroup analysis by region showing a higher prevalence of
HDPs [20]. This confirms the high prevalence of HDPs in
the region, and the needs for better strategies for prevention
to improve pregnancy outcomes are required in the mater-
nity care centers.
The disparity of the disease burden among the various
studies could be attributed to a lack of consensus on the
diagnostic criteria of the various hypertensive disorders.
This is because the health facilities in this study all use treat-
ment protocols similar to the national standard treatment
guidelines [21] for management of HDPs. However, the
blood pressure level to start treatment depends on the facil-
ity, prescriber on duty, and other patient-related factors [16].
It would be appropriate to address these discrepancies so
that accurate prevalence can be recorded and tackled well.
Despite the above explanation, Ghana has often recorded
a high burden of HDPs, and this should be of national health
concern because it has been a major cause of maternal and
prenatal morbidity and mortality.
Knowledge of an individual on a particular health condi-
tion influences the health seeking behaviour of individual
[22]. Thus, knowledge on HDPs has been assessed as efforts
at preventing HDP burden. It is evident from this study that
almost half (44%) of the women have excellent knowledge of
HDPs. This is very encouraging. Having more knowledge
would mean that the mother would be informed on the
causes, risk factors, signs, symptoms, and possibly treatment
options for HDPs. Considering the negative effect of these
disorders on both maternal and neonatal outcomes coupled
with the associated economic cost of management, an
increase in knowledge would go a long way to decrease the
burden of the disorders, improve treatment compliance,
and overall reduce maternal and neonatal morbidities and
mortalities associated with the disorders. It is expected that
as the knowledge of an individual increases, the risk of con-
tracting that disease reduces.

Oral nifedipine and oral methyldopa, at different doses,
were the drugs often prescribed. This finding is similar to
the findings of Kumar et al. where it was observed that both
nifedipine and methyldopa are the most prescribed antihy-
pertensives in pregnancy [23]. Nifedipine is a calcium chan-
nel blocker which is effective at reducing blood pressure
without uteroplacental blood flow nor slowing foetal heart
rate [24]. While methyldopa is preferred because it is a cen-
trally acting a-agonist that decreases sympathetic outflow to
decrease BP, it has a very long duration of action and the
best safety profile amongst the antihypertensive drugs used
during pregnancy [25]. Currently methyldopa has no associ-
ated congenital anomaly. The prescribed medications are
accepted for the management of hypertensive disorders in
pregnancy because of their low risk of adverse complications
in pregnancy. All the prescribed drugs are in line with the
stated guidelines.
The mean blood pressure of pregnant women at 16 week
gestation was 119.7/76.9 mmHg, which is considered nor-
mal. However, this average is confounded by several factors
such as the gestational stage and the baseline blood pressure
at the start of the pregnancy. At around the fifth week of ges-
tation, there is an expansion of the blood volume which
causes a drop in the blood pressure of the mother. At this
critical stage, hypertensive mothers may appear to have a
normal blood pressure [24]. This may have accounted for
the normotensive mean blood pressure of mothers at that
gestational age. At the point of delivery, it was realized that
the mean BP of the mothers was 121.8/77 mmHg which
saw a significant increase of the mean diastolic pressure of
the mothers. Even though, the mean blood pressures of the
mothers were still within the normotensive regions. This
increase in the mean diastolic pressure may be normaliza-
tion of the BP after the initial drop of the blood pressure.
Again, from the results obtained, it was realized that
there was a significant decrease in the proportion of mothers
who had high blood pressure by 10.4% (Table 1). This
indicates that management of mothers who had high blood
Journal of Pregnancy
pressure at 16 week gestation resulted in a decrease of the
proportion of mothers who had high blood pressure at the
time of delivery. It is also worth noting that as part of man-
agement, some proportion of mothers delivered preterm as
part of efforts to avert adverse birth complications. Thus,
at time of delivery, these mothers would be hypertensive.
Hence, although there was a drop, the proportion of mothers
who were hypertensive at delivery was significantly higher
and of public health concern.
The level of education influenced the risk of being hyper-
tensive in pregnancy such that mothers who had junior high
school education were 68% less likely to develop HDPs com-
pared to the likelihood of mothers without any formal edu-
cation developing HDPs. This finding is consistent with
the findings of Abalos et al. [26] where evidence obtained
established that education was a risk factor for hypertensive
disorders. This may be that as an individual that is educated,
there is an increased chance of been informed on the risk
factors and prevention of HDPs. So that, they may take nec-
essary measures to prevent the risk of developing HDPs.
However, there was no statistical significance association
between the odds of mothers who had no formal education
developing HDPs compared to the odds of mothers who
had other levels of education developing HDPs. Under the
bivariate analysis, mothers with tertiary education were
1.85 times more likely to develop HDPs compared to
mothers who had no formal education. However, after
adjusting for known confounders, this association dimin-
ished with no statistical significance. This indicates that the
observed association maybe an anomaly, and, as such, it is
inconclusive to suggest that education status influences the
risk of HDPs in this study.
It was also realized that high number of pregnancies
greatly influenced the risk of HDPs (Table 4). Though sev-
eral studies, such as Sengodan and Sreeprathi [27], have
established that primigravid mothers were at risk of HDPs,
the findings from this study corroborate the evidence by
Cho et al. [28] that mothers with multiple gestation have
an increased risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy,
particularly preeclampsia. However, it has been established
that up to about 61.2% of hypertensive disorders do not
resolve after delivery [29]. When these hypertensions do
not resolve before a woman gets pregnant again, it is consid-
ered as chronic hypertension in pregnancy and thus
increases the cumulative burden of hypertensive disorders
amongst mothers with multigravidity.
Genetics has been explained to influence the risk of
chronic disease in several populations. The evidence of this
study suggests that mothers who have family history of
HDPs were at 3.6 times increased risk of developing HDPs
compared to women who have no family history of hyper-
tensive disorders. This is in sync with the systematic review
by Tesfa et al. [30] which confirmed that family history of
hypertension increased the risk of hypertensive disorders
in pregnancy by fourfolds. Since family members share some
genetic make-up and some lifestyle or habits [31], there is an
increased likelihood that they may share similar risk of a
particular disease burden [32]. This explains why mothers
with family history of hypertensive disorders are at an

increased risk of HDPs. It is therefore recommended that in
diagnosing a mother of HDPs, the risk profile should con-
sider the history of hypertension in the family. This would
help in early diagnosing and management of hypertensive
disorders.
The use of complementary and alternative medicine
(CAM) is predominant in Ghana, and it is recognized by
the health system [33]. Nonetheless, the role of CAM in
management of HDPs is scarce [34]. Evidence from this
study found that mothers who used herbal medicines were
2.9 times more likely to have HDPs. Some studies have
reported the beneficial use of CAM in pregnancy and how
it has improved on blood pressure levels and also on various
obstetric outcomes [35].
This study's finding does not imply that the use of herbal
medicines negatively increases blood pressure. This is
because the study is methodologically limited to the use of
herbal medicines. It did not assess the type of herbal medi-
cine used, how the herbal medicines were used, and whether
it was prescribed or was appropriate for use. However, this
finding reveals a very critical issue of the appropriate use
of herbal medicines in pregnancy. Herbal medicines are
made up of several constituents, and the safety of their use
should be ascertained. Currently, there is paucity of infor-
mation on the use of herbal medicine in the management
of hypertensive disorders, particularly in pregnancy. More
research evidence would be needed to understand why preg-
nant women in selected health facilities use these medicines,
its constituents, and appropriateness for use in hypertensive
disorders.
Alcohol consumption is known to influence hyperten-
Sive disorders in adults. Several studies have propounded
that alcohol consumption, particularly heavy consumption,
increases the risk of hypertension in normotensive individ-
uals [36]. From this study, alcohol consumers were 3.5 times
more likely to experience HDPs compared to nonalcohol
consumers. Alcohol has a biphasic effect on blood pressure.
In less than 12 hours after consumption, alcohol reduces
blood pressure, and subsequently, after 12 hours, alcohol
tends to increase blood pressure. It is believed to influence
the blood pressure through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system by increasing the concentration and activity of renin
in blood [37]. An increase in renin is associated with an
increase in a potent vasoconstrictor called angiotensin II,
responsible for the rise in blood pressure. Additionally, alcohol
is believed to reduce the baroreceptor sensitivity thus affecting
blood pressure regulation at the long term [37]. It is advised
that mothers must be counseled during ANC visits to strictly
avoid alcohol intake during pregnancy.
The aetiology of these HDPs, however, is not known
[38]. It is therefore recommended that to effectively reduce
the incidence of HDPs, pregnant women should be coun-
seled on the risk factors of these conditions and screened
for during their antenatal care visits to prevent the adverse
effects of its complications.
Some studies have established that HDPs influence the
birth outcomes at delivery. From this study, mothers who
had HDPs were 2.66 times more likely to have preterm babies.
This finding is consistent with a study by Xiong et al. [39],
where it was realized that HDPs increased the risk of stillbirth
by twelvefolds. Hypertension is known as the leading cause of
stillbirth by affecting the development of the placenta by
restricting nutrient and oxygen flow to the foetus. Also, it
increases the risk of abnormal bleeding between the placenta
and uterine walls leading to placenta abruption [40]. All these
causes foetal distress and subsequently death. Thus, it is

and possibly foetal wastage.
Another evidence from this study reveals that hyperten-
Sive mothers were 1.70 times more likely to undergo caesar-
ean section. This finding is consistent with the findings of
Roberts et al. [41], where it was realized that HDPs were
associated
with an increased risk of caesarean section
amongst mothers during delivery. Considering this evidence,
it is recommended that health professionals in charge of
antenatal care critically monitor hypertensive mothers dur-
ing care and to pragmatically help to control their blood
pressure to normotensive status before delivery.

5. Conclusion and Recommendations
The overall prevalence of HDPs was 37.2% with chronic
hypertension superimposed with preeclampsia having the
highest prevalence of 17.6%. Lack of formal education, fam-
ily history, multigravida, consumption of alcohol, and herbal
preparation were identified as factors that could influence
the risk of HDPs. The use oral nifedipine and methyldopa
considerably reduced the proportion of mothers with high
blood pressure. The selected mothers with HDPs were likely
to undergo caesarean sections, experience stillbirth, or have
preterm babies. The burden of HDPs is high amongst preg-
nant women seeking care in selected facilities. There is the
need for intensified campaign on HDPs in the Ashanti
Region of Ghana.
Considering the increasing risk of HDPs in the Ashanti
region, its increased adverse association to obstetric out-
comes such as stillbirth, preterm, and caesarean section,
there is the need to investigate the cost impact of HDPs on
the mother and the household. Additionally, the quality of
life of mothers diagnosed with HDPs and the impact of
HDPs on the risk of prenatal and postnatal depression
should be assessed further.
6. Strength and Limitations
This study was well powered considering the sample size as
such reducing the risk of type 1 error. Additionally, the par-
ticipants were clearly defined using the inclusion and exclu-
Sion criteria, outcomes were appropriately measured, and
potential confounding factors were considered in the analy-
sis. Therefore, findings of this study are generalizable to
pregnant women seeking antenatal care in the Sub-Saharan
African region.
This study required mothers to recall past event, and this
subjected the responses to recall bias. To minimize this bias,
where mothers could not recall an event, they were permit-
ted to skip the item on a questionnaire. Additionally, this
study does not establish causality but rather provides the
strength of association between the outcome variables and
predictors, as such interpretations of the findings should be
done carefully.

Background: Poor pregnancy risk perception, ignorance of obstetric risk symptoms, and attitudes toward institutional delivery
services are factors that prevent pregnant women from choosing to receive emergency obstetric treatment.
Objective: To assess pregnancy risk perception, attitude towards skilled delivery service, and knowledge of obstetric danger signs
and associated factors among pregnant mothers.
Methods: A cross-sectional community-based study design was used. The 668 pregnant women who participated in this study were
chosen using a multi-stage sampling methodology. Data were gathered using a pretested questionnaire that was presented by an
interviewer. To find independent factors, logistic regression analysis was used. With a p-value of less than 0.05, which denotes
statistical significance, a corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated.
Results: Pregnancy risk perception was shown to have a lower mean score (23) overall. Only 40.9% of the study participants had high
pregnancy risk perception. Over 50% (337) of respondents had a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization. In all categories of
obstetric danger signs, only 153 respondents (or 22.9%) knew what the obstetric danger signs were. Maternal age (AOR = I .966, CI: I. 185—
3.261), maternal education (AOR = 1.965, 1.002—3.854), and parity (AOR = 0.534, CI: 0.305—0.933) were factors affecting knowledge of
obstetric danger signs. Pregnancy risk Perception (AOR = 14.7, CI: 9.849—22.235) and parity (AOR = 2.27, CI: I .381—3.733) were significantly
associated with attitudes on the use of skilled delivery services.
Conclusion: This study found that pregnant women in rural locations had poor levels of knowledge of obstetric danger sign, attitude
toward using skilled delivery services, and perception of pregnancy risk. The knowledge of obstetric danger indicators among pregnant
women was considerably affected by the mother's age, education, and parity. The perception of pregnancy risk and parity were found
to be substantially associated with attitudes towards skilled delivery services.

Background
In 2017, too many women died from pregnancy-related causes and childbirth-related causes. Complications during and
after childbirth claimed the lives of close to 300,000 women. Most of these deaths (94%) were avoidable and took place
in low-income settings. Two-thirds (196,000) and one-fifth (254,000) of all maternal deaths occurred in sub-Saharan
Africa and Southern Asia, respectively. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for approximately 86% (254,000) of all maternal
deaths (58,000).1 2
Ethiopia is one of the nations most affected by high maternal and newborn deaths. Obstetric problems such as
bleeding, obstructed labor/ruptured uterus, pregnancy-induced hypertension, puerperal infection, and unsafe abortions are

the main causes of mother death in Ethiopia. Anaemia and malaria were the two most reported indirect causes of
maternal death.3 Ethiopia's maternal and infant mortality rates have reduced by 50% since 2000; however, they are still
excessively high at 412 per 100,000 live births and 67 per 1000, respectively.
Risk perception is the way that individuals judge and assess the hazards to which they may be exposed. 3 4 It appears
that a higher perception of health danger enhances protective motivation, thus it is critical to comprehend how people
view health risks, how correct these views are, and how their perception influences their behaviour. High-risk pregnant
women's decisions about prenatal care and the care they receive during their pregnancies are greatly influenced by their
risk perception. Risk perception is a significant concern, particularly during pregnancy when behavioural changes in
6
health have the potential to affect both the mother and the fetus.
Pregnancy-related risk perception is a subject that has attracted a lot of attention globally. According to a recent
concept analysis, women's perceptions about risk during pregnancy have an impact on their decision-making during
pregnancy and childbirth. 7 Pregnancy-related risk perception is a complicated topic because it affects both the mother
and the fetus. Because even well-intentioned measures may not be successful without this understanding, prenatal care
professionals must be aware of how women perceive risk.
Unexpected events that happen to pregnant women during pregnancy, labor, childbirth, or postpartum are known as
9,10
obstetric danger indicators. Among the most frequently observed obstetric danger symptoms include impaired vision,
the absence of fetal movements, vaginal bleeding, a gush of fluid from the vagina, high temperature, foul-smelling
vaginal discharge, convulsions, abdominal pain, and severe headaches. More than 75% of maternal mortality in
11—14
developing nations are caused by pregnancy-related conditions which are preventable.
Maternal health promotion
and education for women, men, and community members to enhance awareness about obstetric danger signs are effective
measures that can prevent birth-related complications. 15 Henceforth, the World Health Organization (WHO) suggests
educating all pregnant women about obstetric danger signs at each prenatal visit. 16 Doing so will enable early detection
5
of obstetric danger signs and facilitate appropriate emergency obstetric care.
Numerous studies revealed that the level of knowledge of obstetric danger signs was low in sub-Saharan Africa and
Asia, even though recognizing and understanding them plays an important role in reducing both maternal and child
mortality by prompting the decision to seek emergency interventions.
Studies have shown that pregnant women put off making decisions to seek obstetric treatment because of poor
17,18
understanding of the risks and difficulties in pregnancy-related complications.
Studies done in Ethiopia revealed that
19,20
there is a lack of awareness of obstetric danger signs among pregnant women. The majority of the research on
pregnant women's awareness of obstetric danger signs in Ethiopia was conducted in urban and institutional settings. This
study helps in identifying the gaps in the community's understanding of obstetric danger signs, level of knowledge of
pregnancy risk perception, and attitude toward skilled delivery service use among pregnant women in rural areas. It will
also be a resource for health service providers, policymakers, and program managers as they develop intervention
strategies to increase community awareness of obstetric danger signs and pregnancy risk. As far as we are aware, there
has never been a published study done in the rural environment on the topic. Therefore, this study sought to evaluate
pregnant women's perceptions of pregnancy risks, degree of understanding of obstetric danger signs, attitudes toward
using skilled delivery services, and related factors in rural areas of Hadiya Zone, Southern Ethiopia.
Methods
Study Design and Setting
This study was conducted in two districts of Hadiya Zone: Lemo and Ameka districts. Hadiya Zone is situated 232
kilometers from Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia, in the South nation and nationalities regional state of Southern
Ethiopia. The study took place between February 10 and March 25, 2023. A cross-sectional study with a focus on the
community was used.
All of the pregnant women who lived in the two districts during the study period comprised the source population.
Participants who were gravely ill and unable to communicate were not included in this study. This study was part of a cluster
randomized control trial study that examined the effectiveness of engagement of religious leaders in maternal health

education. It is part of the baseline survey. The sample size was determined based on a cluster randomized control trial study
design. According to the Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey 2019, skilled birth attendance in a rural area of Ethiopia
was predicted to be 430/0.9 The sample size was based on 80% power to detect a 15-percentage point anticipated difference in
the proportion of skilled delivery service utilization (an increase from 43% to 58%) (With a 5% error level) and design effect of
2. A sample size of 50 pregnant mothers per cluster was required, and accordingly, the final calculated sample size was 341 per
pregnant mothers per group after considering a 10% loss (682).
Twelve clusters from two Hadiya Zone districts were involved in this study (Lemo and Ameka districts). In order to locate
clusters (kebeles), a simple random sampling technique was used. Pregnant women were then contacted using a cluster
sampling technique. Interviews with pregnant women who met the inclusion requirements were conducted for the study. The
participants in the baseline study did not Intend to leave their current residence before the completion of the follow-up period.
In cooperation with health extension workers and kebele leaders, a census was carried out to determine all eligible pregnant
women of reproductive age (15—49 years) who permanently resided in the selected districts from the selected clusters. Once
pregnancy was detected through census work, the women would be recruited for the study.
Data Collection and Procedure
We used questionnaires that already existed from studies done before and adapted them to fit our needs. The questionnaires
were pretested and administered by an interviewer. They were developed by the Johns Hopkins Program for International
Education in Gynaecology and Obstetrics (JHPIEGO) maternal and neonatal health program, and we tweaked them to fit the
local context and our research goals. 10 We pre-tested a survey among 25 pregnant mothers who were not a part of the main
study. The survey had five sections — socio-demographic, obstetrics, risk perception, danger signs during pregnancy, labor/
delivery, and postpartum period and attitude. The data collectors went to respondents ' houses and interviewed them in person
to gather the data. We recruited data collectors (clinical nurses and BSc nurses) and 2 supervisors (BSc degree in public
health). We chose them based on their data collection experience and fluency in the language of the community. They were
then trained on the objectives of the study, the survey, and the data collection process. The principal investigators and
supervisors double-checked the surveys to make sure they were complete and relevant.
Quality Control
Internal consistency (reliability) was tested by calculating Cronbach's Alpha using SPSS window version 23.
Furthermore, health behavior experts crosschecked the content validity of the tool. Data collectors and supervisors
were trained about the study instrument and data collection procedure. The principal investigator and the supervisors
checked the collected data for completeness.
Measurement and Operational Definitions of the Scale Variables
11
Pregnancy risk perception was assessed using the questionnaire developed from a previous study. This questionnaire is made
up of nine questions which assess how a pregnant women perceive potential dangers during pregnancy. In this study, the
questionnaire consists oftwo subscales that include four questions about the risk to self (mother) (for example "Is the risk of
having a caesarean section") and five questions about risk to the baby (for example "is a risk of baby having a birth defect").
Respondents were asked to rate on a five-pomt scale (1 no risk at all, 2 unlikely, 3 possible, 4 High, 5 extremely high),
how they perceived the pregnancy risk. 12 The scores from each of the 9 items were added up to get a total pregnancy risk
perception score. A higher score means that the person has a greater perception of risk. The mean score was used to divide
people into two groups: those with a high perception of risk and those with a low perception of risk.
Pregnant women in this study mentioned danger signs during pregnancy, delivery, and postpartum period. We
measured how much they knew about these danger signs by asking them to name them without giving leading questions.
We sorted their knowledge into two categories: pregnant women with good knowledge and pregnant women with poor
knowledge. In this study, a pregnant woman was deemed to be knowledgeable about the danger signs if she could, either
spontaneously or upon prompting name at least three significant danger signs for each of the three periods of pregnancy,
13
childbirth, and postpartum. The mothers were prompted by giving them more time to attempt and recall these periods.

Attitude toward skilled delivery service utilization has 10 items that were measured by using a Likert scale where
respondents were supposed to strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree. 14 The overall attitude score
was computed by summing up the items after performing the reverse scoring for negatively worded sentences. A higher
composite score indicated a more positive attitude. The Mean score was used to categorize attitudes into positive and
negative attitudes.
Data Processing and Analysis
Data were cleaned and entered using Epidata version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Logistic regression was
carried out to identify determmants of obstetric danger signs' knowledge. Variables with p < 0.25 in the bivariate analysis
were selected as candidate variables for multivariate logistic analysis to control the effect of confounders. Adjusted odd
ratios (AORs) with their 95% confidence interval and p < 0.05 were considered to have a significant association between
the outcome and independent variables. The model fitness was checked using Hosmer and Lemeshow and was found fit.
Results

Obstetric History of Respondents
Sadore et al
Among the total participants, 421 (63%) were multigravida. Most of the respondents 489 (73.2%) visited antenatal care
at least once (Table 2).
Pregnancy Risk Perception
The findings revealed that participants had a low mean score of 23 for their perception of pregnancy risk with a standard
deviation of 5.8. Less than half of the study participants 273 (40.9%) had high levels of pregnancy risk perception. This
study showed that pregnancy risk perception was high among mothers in the age group of 25—34 years 174 (63.7%),
mothers with educational status of primary education 168 (61%), mothers who visited ANC once twice 199 (72%) and
multigravida mothers 148 (54%). One hundred sixty (24%), 125 (18.7%), and 299 (38.3%) respondents thought that they
had the possibility of losing too much blood, having a cesarean section, and dying during their pregnancy, respectively.
The majority of study participants thought that the pregnancy risk to themselves and their babies was unlikely (Table 3).

Knowledge of Obstetric Danger Signs Among Pregnant Mothers
Only 153 (22.9%) of respondents had knowledge about obstetric danger signs in all categories (pregnancy, childbirth, and
postpartum period). 147 (22%), 130 (19.5%) and 128 (19.2%) of study subjects mentioned at least three danger signs
during pregnancy, labor, postpartum, and childbirth, respectively. Only 159 (23.8%) of respondents were knowledgeable
about danger signs during pregnancy. One hundred thirty-nine (20.8%) of respondents were knowledgeable about danger
signs during labor and childbirth and 137 (20.5%) of respondents were knowledgeable about danger signs during the
postpartum period. Weakness 173 (25.9%), vaginal bleeding 145 (21.7%), and reduced fetal movement 105 (15.7%) were
frequently mentioned danger signs by respondents during pregnancy. Labor of more than 12 h 174 (26%) and abnormal
fetal position 109 (16.3%) were frequently mentioned danger signs by study participants during labor and childbirth. One
hundred ninety-six (29.3%) of respondents mentioned vaginal bleeding as a danger sign during the postpartum period
(Table 4).

Related Factors with Knowledge of Obstetric Danger Signs
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the age of respondents, maternal education, and parity were significantly
related with knowledge of obstetric danger signs. Pregnant mothers in the age group of 25—34 years were 1.966 times
more likely to be knowledgeable of obstetrics danger signs than pregnant mothers who were in the age group of 15—24
years (AOR = 1.966, CI: 1.185—3.261). Pregnant mothers with the educational status of primary education were 1.965
times more likely to be knowledgeable of obstetrics danger signs than pregnant mothers with the educational status of
illiterate (AOR = 1.96, CI: 1.002—3.854). It was also observed that the probability of knowing obstetric danger signs
decreased by 53% among primipara mothers compared to nullipara mothers (AOR 0.534, CI: 0.305—0.933) (Table 5).
Attitude Toward Skilled Delivery Service Utilization
This study revealed that participants had a mean score of 30.4 for their attitude toward skilled delivery service utilization
with a standard deviation of 7.8. More than half of the study participants 337 (50.4) had a positive attitude toward skilled
delivery service utilization (Table 6).

Some people believe that any pregnant woman can
develop delivery complication
Some people feel that delivery complications can be
dangerous to the health of a woman
It is believed that delivery complications cannot be

According to some people's belief, a woman should
plan ahead of time where she will give birth to her baby.
Some women feel that they shouldn't plan ahead of time
how they will get to the place where they will give birth.
Some women feel that every pregnant woman need
skilled care at delivery needs skilled care during delivery

According to the feelings of some pregnant women, it
is very shameful to deliver on the delivery bed in the
labor ward
Many women believe that women do not go to a health
facility for delivery, mainly because it is too expensive.
Many women believe that women do not go to a health

Factors Associated with Attitude Toward Skilled Delivery Service Utilization
In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, perception of pregnancy risk and parity were significantly associated with
attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization. Pregnant mothers with a high perception of pregnancy risk were 14.7
times more likely to have a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization than pregnant mothers with low
pregnancy risk perception (AOR = 14.7, CI: 9.849—22.235). Parity was another factor that was independently associated
with the attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization, pregnant mothers who were multiparous were 2.27 times
more likely to have a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization than nulliparous pregnant mothers
(AOR = 2.27, Cl: 1.381-3.733) (Table 7).
Discussion
The majority of preventable maternal deaths in developing countries are due to delays in the pregnant mother or her
family's decision to seek care, delays in visiting the place of delivery, and delays in receiving adequate hospital care. 15 In
such cases, the lack of knowledge about pregnancy risk and obstetric danger signs and attitude towards skilled delivery
service utilization contribute to the delays in seeking emergency obstetric care, resulting in high mortality and morbidity
16
rates. Pregnant mothers can avoid obstetric complications if they can identify the forewarning pregnancy risks and
obstetric danger signs. In resource-limited countries like Ethiopia, increasing the level of awareness of obstetric danger
signs and skilled delivery service utilization among women are feasible strategies to reduce maternal mortality and

morbidity related to obstetric complications. However, the pregnancy risk perception and level of knowledge are low
among women in Southern Africa including Ethiopia.
This study was conducted to assess the current
pregnancy risk perception, attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization, and level of pregnant women's knowledge
of obstetric danger signs and related factors in rural areas in Hadiya Zone, Southern Ethiopia.
The result showed that more than half of pregnant mothers had a low perception of obstetric risks and the total and
a low mean score of pregnancy risk perception of 23. This finding is lower than the one reported using different
instruments to measure pregnancy risk perception in Northern Ethiopia. This study found that 48% of respondents had
a high level of pregnancy risk perception.18 The mean score in our study score is lower than the findings reported in
Canada (mean score 29.67) which utilized the same instrument to measure pregnancy risk perception among nulliparous
Canadian women of advanced maternal. 19 Similarly, a study in Thailand found that women of advanced maternal age had
mean scores of perception of pregnancy risk that fell below (32.9).12 This difference might be because of the difference
in maternal age and measurement instruments. Another possible explanation is that risk perception in pregnancy is
multifaceted and influenced by multiple personal factors.
In this research, the overall proportion of knowledge of obstetric danger signs among pregnant mothers was 22.9%.
This finding is consistent with the finding reported in South Ethiopia in Yirgachefe city and Eastern
Democratic Republic of the Congo Our study was done among rural mothers. In this study, the knowledge
of obstetric danger signs was higher than the findings reported in Wolayita Sodo City in Southern Ethiopia (16.8%)26 and
Jordan
In addition, it is lower than the values reported by studies conducted in Chamwino District, Tanzama
Angolela Tera District in Northern Ethiopia (37.5%), Hossan Town Southern Ethiopia Shashemane
Town in the Oromia region in Ethiopia and KwaZulu Natal in South Africa This discrepancy could be
differences in the sociocultural backgrounds that characterize each of these regions.
In this study, obstetric danger signs were categorized into three parts: pregnancy, labor/childbirth, and the postpartum
period. The danger signs that were most frequently discussed during pregnancy were weakness 173 (25.9%), vaginal
bleeding 145 (21.7%), and reduced fetal movement 105 (15.7%), which is contradictory to a study reported in the Eastern

Democratic Republic of the Congo, which found that severe abdominal pain was the best-known danger sign. This
result was in line with other research findings published in Ethiopia and Africa and revealed that severe vaginal bleeding
was the frequently mentioned obstetric danger sign during pregnancy and postpartum period.
Labor of more
than 12 hours and abnormal fetal position were the most common danger Signs mentioned by study participants during
26
labor and childbirth. This finding was consistent with the finding reported in Wolayita Sodo Town, Southern Ethiopia.
In this study, the age of pregnant mothers, maternal education, and parity were determinants of knowledge of obstetric
danger signs. Pregnant mothers aged 25—34 years were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of
obstetric danger indicators. This result is consistent with results from other studies that have been done in Arbaminch,
Wolayita Sodo, and Yirgacheffe Towns, South Ethiopia, and South Eastern Nigeria. Women in this age category are
believed to be physically and psychologically ready to accept information about obstetric danger signs. This result
contradicts a study conducted in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo that found women aged 30—39 years
were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators.
In this study, maternal age, education, and parity were determinants of knowledge of obstetric danger signs. Pregnant
mothers aged 25—34 years were more likely than other age groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators.

the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo that found women aged 30—39 years were more likely than other age
groups to be knowledgeable of obstetric danger indicators.
The multivariate logistic regression revealed that
the knowledge of obstetric danger signs among pregnant women was associated with parity. The probability of knowing
obstetric danger signs decreased by 53% among primipara mothers compared to nullipara mothers. This finding contra-
25
dicts the finding reported in Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, it is consistent with the results
reported in other studies.
In this study, the mean score of attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization was 30.4. More than half of the study
participants 337 (50.4) had a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization. This finding was lower than the
finding reported in Oromia Region, Ethiopia Our finding is higher than the result reported in Northwest Ethiopia
(28.3%).33 A possible explanation could be differences in study setting and health program implementation. This study
revealed that pregnant mothers with a high perception of pregnancy risk were more likely to have a positive attitude toward
skilled delivery service utilization than pregnant mothers with a low pregnancy risk perception. This is because having risk
perception could develop a positive attitude towards health service utilization. The utilization behavior of individuals is
34
driven by their perception to develop a positive attitude and take over the action. It was also observed that pregnant mothers
who were multiparous were more likely to have a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization than
nulliparous pregnant mothers. This may be because pregnant mothers who experienced previous births were more likely
to benefit from maternal health services and learn from their experiences.
The results of this study have important policy implications. Determining the level of the pregnancy risk perception,
knowledge of obstetric danger signs and attitude of pregnant women towards skilled delivery service utilization can
predict their preventive practice, and identifying variables is crucial for developing appropriate risk communication
methods and measures.
Limitations
Regarding limitations of this study, bias might be provoked in prompting the participants to mention the danger signs,
though the authors tried their best to avoid it. In addition, reports of the pregnant mothers may under/overestimate the
result because the data was collected by self-report.
Conclusion
In this study, pregnancy risk perception, attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization, and level of pregnant
women's knowledge of obstetric danger indicators in Lemo and Ameka Districts of Hadiya Zone were low.
Maternal age, maternal education, and parity of the respondents were determinants of knowledge of obstetric

danger signs. It was also observed that perception of pregnancy risk and parity were significantly associated with
attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization. Based on the findings of this study, we recommend that
stakeholders of the health sector develop a strategic plan to Increase pregnancy risk perception, pregnant women's
knowledge of obstetric danger indicators and develop a positive attitude towards skilled delivery service utilization
to reduce maternal death through the provision of health education and health promotion.
Ethics Approval and Consent to Participate
This study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Jimma University (Ref no: JUIH/IRB223/22).
Permission letter was obtained from respective health departments. An information sheet including the purpose and

Abstract
The potential death toll from an epidemic is larger than the number of deaths directly
associated with the infection. In this study, we find that prenatal exposure to a cholera
epidemic in Peru increased childhood mortality and that surviving children were
more likely to be underweight and to suffer from diarrhea. We further find that a sig-
nificant part of this mortality happened during the first day of life, and that prenatal
exposure to cholera decreased prenatal care and institutional deliveries, suggesting
that the mortality and possibly other longer-term effects were partially driven by a
reduction in prenatal investments.

1 Introduction
Epidemics have been on the rise for the past several decades and will likely continue
to do so in the near future. The potential death toll attributable to an epidemic is
considerably larger than the number of deaths directly associated with the infection.
Children exposed to an epidemic while in utero are particularly vulnerable; infected

pregnant women can transmit the disease through the placenta, and even if the virus
or bacteria does not affect the fetus directly, symptoms of the disease, such as dehy-
dration, high fever or stress can affect the fetus in ways that are not visible until after
the child is born or even later in life. Additionally, the economic hardship that an
epidemic imposes to pregnant women and their households, and the potential satu-
ration of the healthcare capacity can affect parental investments, including maternal
nutrition, vaccines and skilled care during pregnancy and during birth. We know
from a number of studies in epidemiology and economics that in utero is a critical
developmental period and that shocks during this period, including epidemics, have
long-term consequences (Almond and Currie 2011). We know less about their effect
on postnatal childhood mortality and the potential mediating role of prenatal invest-
ments. In this study, we aim to contribute to this literature by exploring the effects of
prenatal exposure to the Peruvian cholera epidemic in the early 1990s.
There have been seven cholera pandemics in the last 200 years. The seventh began
in the early 1960s in Asia and spread through Africa and Europe in the early 1970s.
Cholera rates remained relatively low during the 1980s and were confined to Asia
and Africa, but in the early 1990s an outbreak began in Peru that became the first
cholera epidemic in Latin America since 1895 (Lam et al. 2010). Peru suffered the
most severe outbreak of cholera of the region and the health system collapsed in many
regions of the country (Cueto 2017). With a large majority of the population work-
ing informally, without access to medical paid-leave, the epidemic also generated
important economic consequences for households (Suårez and Bradford 1993).
From an empirical perspective, studying the cholera epidemic in Peru is conve-
nient because it began unexpectedly. "Disease control experts are largely at a loss to
explain why cholera has returned to South America in the first epidemic since 1895"
(Brookes, 1991, p. 3). The bacteria seemed to originate from the Pacific Ocean; the
first cases spread from the coastal cities of Peru to other regions of the country, and
later to other countries as well. The abruptness and severity of the epidemic, as well
as the speed of contagion, provide us with a nearly ideal natural experiment. In April
1991, a professor from the University of Maryland School of Medicine commented
about the cholera epidemic in Peru, "It's pure guesswork as to where it is going"
(Brookes 1991, p. 4). In retrospect, it seems that the spread of the disease over differ-
ent regions of the country over time, in particular during the first year of the epidemic,
was largely determined by each region's geographical proximity to the initial cases.
Within a region contagion was more likely under unsanitary conditions, but not even
households with access to piped water at home were safe from contagion because
water was not sufficiently chlorinated (Cueto 2017).
We apply a difference-in-difference methodology exploiting the spread of the
cholera epidemic in Peru by month and region. Our data comes mainly from two
sources: the Population Census of 1993, in which mothers were asked the birth date
of their youngest child born alive and whether or not that child was alive at the time
of the interview; and the Health and Demographic Survey of 1992, which includes
information of childhood mortality and parental investments, and allows us also to
control for mother fixed effects.

The effects of an epidemic on prenatal investments, childhood...
507
We find that an increase in I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during
the last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by 0.05 per-
centage points, or 4%, according to our most conservative estimate. The event study
shows that this effect was not driven by a pre-existing trend. We also find that later
mortality is concentrated in girls and that surviving children are more likely to suffer
from severe diarrhea, and have lower weight for age, and are more likely to be under-
weight. Finally, we find that the epidemic increased first-day mortality and reduced
prenatal care and institutional deliveries, suggesting the mortality, and possibly, other
longer-term effects were partially driven by a reduction in prenatal investments.
There is a well-established literature that shows that in utero is a particular sensi-
tive stage in life for the formation of human capital. Most of this literature focuses
on long-term effects of prenatal exposure to a variety of shocks (Almond and Currie
2011). The seminal study of Almond (2006) finds that in utero exposure to the 1918
influenza pandemic had long-term negative effects in terms of education attainment,
physical disability, income and socioeconomic status. Closely related to our study,
Ogasawara and Inoue (2018) and Ritter (2020) find negative long-term effects of pre-
natal exposure to the cholera epidemic among adults in Japan and Peru, respectively.
A relatively smaller number of studies have shown that in utero shocks may have an
effect on postnatal childhood mortality. In particular, it has been shown that expo-
sure to pollution (Jayachandran 2009), extreme rainfall (Rocha and Soares 2015),
extreme heat (Banerjee and Maharaj 2020), and violent conflict (Dagnelie et al. 2018)
increases infant mortalityl. This paper aims to contribute to this literature by ana-
lyzing the effect of prenatal exposure to an epidemic on childhood mortality. Our
results are particularly relevant in a context where official reports of deaths due to
epidemics in many countries differ considerably from estimations of the number of
excess deaths (FT 2()20).2 These estimations, however, do not disentangle what pro-
portion of the excess deaths is due exclusively to underreporting of direct deaths from
that attributable to indirect deaths. According to our estimations, the total number of
children who died due to exposure to the cholera epidemic while in their last trimester
in utero was approximately 900, while the official number of total cholera deaths for
1991 is 2,909. This means that the human cost of the epidemic was approximately
30% larger if we consider the effect of prenatal exposure on postnatal childhood mor-
tality. Moreover, the official mortality rate from the cholera epidemic in Peru, during
1991, is 9 in every 100,000 inhabitants, while our estimated mortality rate due to
prenatal exposure is 150 in every 100,000 children that were born alive in 1991.
With this paper we also aim to contribute to the literature by providing evidence of
the potential role of prenatal investments, in particular prenatal care and institutional
deliveries, as mediators between the in utero shock and the effect on childhood mor-
tality and possibly longer-term human capital outcomes. Prenatal care is important to
prevent and treat conditions that might affect the mother and/or the fetus, but it is also
Other important studies that investigate postnatal early childhood shocks on mortality rate are included
in the review of Almond et al. (2018).
2 As of July 2020, Peru has more than 1,000 excess deaths per million inhabitants, the highest rate in the
world, which largely exceed reported numbers of Covid- 19 deaths (Fl' 2020).

important because it can affect maternal behavior such as smoking, alcohol consump-
tion, nutrition and weight gain, folic acid intake, among others (see, for example,
Evans and Lien, 2005) and these behaviors have been shown to affect birth outcomes
and have long-term human capital outcomes (Aizer and Currie 2014; Nilsson 2017;
Simon 2016; Bharadwaj et al. 2014; Barreca 2010). Institutional deliveries typically
involve skilled professionals with adequate equipments during and immediately after
birth, which are important because they can perform C-sections, when needed, resus-
citate newborns at birth and treat maternal infections, among other things. According
to the World Health Organization, approximately 40% of all under-five child deaths
are neonatal deaths, and approximately half of all neonatal deaths occur after a home
birth and without any healthcare.
There is also more rigorous evidence of the impact of institutional births and
access to healthcare on birth outcomes and infant lives (Currie and Gruber 1996;
Maitra 2004; Daysal et al. 2015; Godlonton and Okeke 2016; Goodman-Bacon 2018;
Adam et al. 2018; Okeke and Chari 2018; Friedman and Keats 2019b, a). Moreover,
there is evidence that skilled care during and immediately after birth can treat prema-
turity, underweight, and other conditions affecting newborns with proper care such as
artificial lung surfactant and specialized nutritional supplements that has long-term
consequences on human capital (Bharadwaj et al. 2013). Epidemics have the poten-
tial to affect access to prenatal care and institutional deliveries; this has been seen, for
example, in the case of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa (Jones et al. 2016; Strong
and Schwartz 2019), although this evidence comes from correlational studies. The
Ebola epidemic is probably an extreme case, given the high probability of getting
infected in hospitals in addition to the fear of getting tested and isolated (Strong and
Schwartz 2019; WHO 2014). In the case of COVID-19, there is evidence that the
lockdown in India increased mortality rate by 64% among dialysis patients. The main
channels in this case appear to be barriers to transportation and disruption in hospital
services (Jain and Dupas 2020).
In this study, we show that even epidemics involving less contagious diseases,
and that do not impose a need for social isolation, such as the cholera epidemic, can
generate a reduction in prenatal care and institutional deliveries. Moreover, many
other shocks that have been analyzed in the fetal origins literature (droughts, wars,
famines and hurricanes among other things) have the potential to affect access to
skilled care during pregnancy and birth; hence, the results of this paper can apply to
a wide range of shocks.
Finally, this paper speaks to the literature on diarrheal diseases, childhood mor-
tality and malnutrition. Although we have found that the cholera epidemic reduced
prenatal investment, we cannot discard the potential direct role of the disease in our
mortality estimates and on the health status of the surviving children. The World
Health Organization estimates that each year diarrheal diseases such as cholera kill
around half a million children under five and are the leading cause of malnutrition.
3 On a positive note, Christensen et al. (2020) show that certain interventions focused on enhancing health
worker performance led to improvements in maternal utilization of clinics during the Ebola crisis in rural
Sierra Leone.

Typically, these estimates come from contemporaneous effects of these diseases, and,
hence, most programs target children after they are born. This study suggests, how-
ever, that protecting children from these diseases after they are born might already be
too late.
2 Background: cholera and the cholera epidemic in Peru
Cholera is one of the most common diarrheal diseases, along with Rotavirus, E. coli,
Shigella, Campylobacter and Salmonella (WHO 2009). It is generated by a bacte-
rial infection. The main effect is acute diarrhea, and all the other consequences are
believed to derive from this main effect (Seas and Gotuzzo 2005). Profuse diarrhea
causes dehydration; pathogens damage the intestines, causing an excessive amount of
water and other nutrient-rich fluids to be secreted rather than being absorbed. Among
pregnant women, particularly during the third trimester, severe dehydration is associ-
ated with a reduction of amniotic fluid, reduced blood flood to the placenta, placental
hemorrhage, hypotension, preterm births and miscarriages (Grados and Battilana
1994; Grout et al. 2015; Hirschhorn et al. 1969; Ciglenecki et al. 2013).
Over the last 200 years, there have been 7 cholera pandemics. The last pandemic
still lingers in many countries. As of 2012, approximately 1.4 billion people were
at risk for cholera and approximately 2.8 million cholera cases occur annually in
countries where it is endemic, while approximately 87,000 cholera cases occur in
non-endemic countries (Ali et al. 2012). In terms of deaths, approximately 91,000
and 2,500 people are reported to die annually of cholera in endemic countries and
non-endemic countries, respectively; these numbers do not include estimations of the
impact on mortality derived by in utero exposure to the disease. Today, approximately
126 million of individuals live in hotspots with a prevalence of cholera higher than
1/1000 (WHO 2020). Most of these hotspots are located in African countries and the
rest are located in the Middle East and Central Asia, where the healthcare capacity
and quality is very poor. Moreover, the spread of cholera around the world is likely
to increase due to global warming (Chowdhury et al. 2017; Shope 1991; Emch et al.
2008).
The cholera epidemic in Peru started in the early 1990s, in the middle of an eco-
nomic crisis. Real GDP per capita fell circa 30% between 1987 and 1990 (Paxson
and Schady 2005). The situation of the health sector was also precarious. Individuals
were supposed to have access to free healthcare, including prenatal services, labor
and delivery. In practice however, the capacity of the health sector was very limited.
The public expenditure in health in 1991 was 0.4% of the GDP, one of the lowest from
Latin America at the time. Many health centers did not function normally because of
a lack of personnel (Pollarolo 2000). The travel costs for many individuals were sig-
nificantly high, given the long distances to the closest health center, some times as far
as 6 or more hours away (INEI 1991). In addition, there were important opportunity
costs, in particular for informal workers (the large majority of workers) for whom a
day without working was a day without earnings.
Naturally, a health system like this was not prepared to deal with an epidemic.
Many hospitals simply collapsed, and the probability of a patient being rejected due

P.l. Ritter, R.A. Sanchez
to lack of capacity or personnel increased significantly. Here are some quotes that
reflect this situation:
hospitals received a growing number of patients that was sometimes four
times greater than the number of bed and staff available. In several cities, staff
had to be taken from other hospital services to look after cholera, some hos-
pitals focused only on patients stricken with the disease, and the physicians
requested the help of one relative per patient. According to one physician from
Cajamarca hospital, during the epidemic "all doctors had to forget their original
specialty"." Cueto (2017, p. 117)
"The emergency room of the hospital ... looked like a battlefield. Sick
patients barely fit in the suffocating room. Some of them were seated ted on
the floor, other lying in beds and others, many, were left to lie on the floor,
[... l. The few nurses and auxiliary personnel extraordinarily called were insuf-
ficient to assist the patients. Several nuns, with their white robes, joined the
effort to attend patients. In some cases, even police officers became sponta-
neously improvised nurses" (our translation from LaRepüblica (1991, p. 14)
IN: Valdivia Rey (2014)).
The lack of capacity to attend patients during the cholera epidemic was very
generalized; according to a nationally representative survey applied in October and
November 1991: only 50% of people who were sick and wanted to get attention got
access to health services (Pollarolo 2000). This evidence illustrates how the cholera
epidemic increased the costs of getting access to healthcare in that it eroded the
already limited capacity of the health sector, increasing the patients' waiting hours
and the probability of being rejected. It is not surprising, therefore, that we find that
the cholera epidemic reduced prenatal care and institutional births.
The epidemic reached 322,562 suspected cases and a total of 2,909 deaths (a mor-
tality rate of 9 per 100 000 inhabitants and 0.9 per 100 cases) in the first year (1991)
and a total of 625,259 accumulated suspected cases and 9,642 accumulated deaths
by September 1994. By the end of 1991, the disease had spread to fourteen countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean, totaling 366,017 cases, with Peru responsible
for 83% of all cases presented in the Americas (Müjica et al. 2013). The epidemic
was caused by the bacterium Vibrium Colérico zero group 01 (Lanata 1989). The
means of contagion is through food handling and consumption, with drinking water
being the most common vehicle of dissemination (Gotuzzo 1991; Maguifia Vargas
et al. 2010). Working age adults were disproportionally affected by the disease, and
becoming infected with cholera typically resulted in medical expenses as well as 1 to
4 days without working (Suårez and Bradford 1993).
Figure I shows that the largest number of cases was reported in 1991, the number
decreasing over time, with a peak of approximately 0.16 per 100 inhabitants per week
in the regions of the jungle. The mortality rate was also much higher in 1991, as we
can see in Fig. 2.
As explained in the Introduction, disease control experts could not explain why
cholera returned to South America in 1991, nor could they predict where it was going
(Brookes 1991). In retrospect, however, several factors seemed to influence the inten-
sity of the disease by region and time. The first of these is the geographical location

and time of the first case. The disease was first reported in the areas around the coastal
cities of Chancay, Chimbote, and Piura at the end of January 1991. Epidemiological
studies suggest that the massive contamination of phytoplankton and seafood in the
warm part of the sea in the North of Lima explains the explosive spread of the dis-
eases (Gotuzzo 1991; Maguifia Vargas et al. 2010). In general, cholera is more likely
to develop in coastal ecologies (Collins 2003). Importantly, this is believed to be the
first case, not just the first diagnosis since adults and children had been tested for
some time before 1991 without any sign of the bacterium Vibrium Cholerae (Gotuzzo
1991). From these zones, the epidemic advanced to other urban and rural areas of
Peru, spreading from coast to the highlands, finally penetrating the Peruvian jungle,
as we can see in Fig. 3.
The second factor that seemed to influence the spread of the disease is warm tem-
peratures and humidity (Lama et al. 2004). As we can see in Fig. I the disease peaked

in the first months of the year, when it is summer on the coast; it spread more homo-
geneously over the year in the jungle, where it is warm and humid all year around,
and the incidence of cholera in the highlands is lower, which is colder and drier all
year around.
Naturally, poor levels of basic sanitation, with inadequate processing of drinking
water also seems to have influenced the expansion of the epidemic (Gotuzzo 1991;
Maguifia Vargas et al. 2010). Water, even piped water, was commonly not (or not
sufficiently) chlorinated and low water pressure and continuous breakdowns in the
service forced people to store water in containers where contaminations was even
more likely. Untreated sewages emptied into the sea, rivers and lakes or used to
irrigate agricultural land (Cueto 2017).
Finally, belonging to the human blood group O has been associated with increased
severity of the disease, and approximately 90% of the indigenous population in Peru
is blood type O (Matson et al. 1966). Individuals with blood type O are not more
likely to be infected by the bacterium, but the cholera toxin exerts a more potent
effect on cells expressing the blood type O-associated glycan (Harris et al. 2005). The
relationship between blood type O and the severity of the disease has been confirmed
in very different settings, and in the particular case of Peru in 1991 it was found that

individuals with blood type O were eight times more likely to be hospitalized with
severe cholera (Swerdlow et al. 1994).
3 Data and summary statistics
Our data make use of four sources of information. The first source of data is the
Population Census of Peru of 1993 (INEI 1993), which asks women age 12 or older
whether their youngest child born alive is still alive. It also asks the birth date (month
and year) of that child. The mortality rate corresponds to the proportion of those
children by cohort and region who have died. We restrict our sample initially to 10
years of cohorts (1984 to 1993) but in our main specification we narrow the sample
from 1984 to 1991, for reasons we will explain in Section 5.
The second source of data is the Health and Demographic Survey (DHS) of 1992.
This dataset collects information on all children born alive in the previous 5 years of
the survey, and records whether or not they are still alive at the time of the interview,
meaning we do not have to rely only on the youngest child in this case. Moreover,
this data set allows us analyze within-siblings effects. It also includes information of
parental investment and other nutritional and health question about the children. We
also limit this data set to children born until 1991.
The third source of data provides information about the incidence of cholera reg-
istered in Peru during the years 1991 to 1993, which was obtained from a report
produced by the General Directorate of Epidemiology, of the Ministry of Health of
Peru (Suårez-Ognio 2011). This information is disaggregated by week, year, and
region (with the exception of Apurimac and Madre de Dios, for which information is
lacking).
Finally, the fourth source of data is from Willmott and Matsuura (2001), which
provides terrestrial air temperature and precipitation information per month and
meteorological station, which we match to regions.
Table 1 shows summary statistics of our sample of children corresponding to the
youngest child born between 1984 and 1991 to women age 12 or older in 1993. Peru
has 25 regions, but as we mentioned above, we only have data on cholera incidence
in 23 of them. There are a total of 2,208 observations that result from collapsing the
data at the region-month level. We weight the means by the number of children born
alive per region and month.
Children are on average 5 years old. The mothers are on average 34 years old,
21% are indigenous, have an average of 4 children in total, 9 years of educational
attainment and 15% of them are illiterate. Forty-nine percent of the children have
piped water at home, 64% have access to a toilet or cesspit. The average mortality
rate is I .8%. The average temperature and rainfall by trimester was 14 oc and 65 mm,
respectively.
The average cholera incidence during the third trimester in utero for those chil-
dren born in 1991 is 0.1% (for children born before that year the incidence is zero),
with a maximum incidence of 3.4%. The cholera incidence, is calculated by dividing
the number of cases by the population of the region as of 1993. Cholera cases are
collected from diagnosis made on the basis of symptoms, not blood tests. This type

of diagnosis has the advantage of not relying on testing capacity, test approval, etc.
Naturally, this type of diagnosis is not perfect either. For example, other acute diar-
rheal infections might be misclassified as cholera infections. Nevertheless, it seems
that the diagnoses were very accurate; in the most important hospital in Peru, of all
the cases of cholera between February and May 1991 (diagnosed by symptoms only),
circa 8% were tested and 100% of these cases reported positive results from the test
(Saona et al. 1991).
Table 2 shows summary statistics of our sample of children corresponding to the
DHS data of children born between 1986 and 1991. There is a total of 9, 155 observa-
tions (children) but only 802 combinations of regions and month-year of birth. Back
in 1991, and for a brief period of time only, Peru was divided into 13 regions. So, the
survey captures that division with the exception of 4 regions in November 1986 for
which there we have no observations. In 1993, the country went to back to have 25
regions and that is captured in the census. We do not collapse this data in order to
exploit the within-sibling variation. We weight the means using the sampling weights
of the survey.
Children in the survey sample are on average 3 years old. The mothers are on
average 29 years old, have an average of 3 children age 0 to 5, and only 6 years of
educational attainment. Fifty-five percent of the children have piped water at home.

The total mortality rate of children is 6%. The prevalence of severe diarrhea (diarrhea
episodes that last three days or more) is 12%, and the prevalence of stunting and
underweight children is 32% and 11%, respectively.
Approximately half of the births are "institutional births", that is in public hos-
pitals or health centers, or in a private location but with the assistance of a doctor.
More precisely, 50% of birth are at home, 49% are in hospitals, health centers and
private clinics or offices and 1% is others. Approximately, 90% of births that occur in
medical institutions or health centers are assisted by a doctor or obstetrician. On the
contrary, less than 6% of the births at home are assisted by a doctor. Most of them are
assisted by a traditional midwife (typically without license), a relative, or no body.
Women have on average 4 prenatal visits, and 32% of women have prenatal
cards ("tarjetas de control prenatal"). These are cards filled by the doctor/nurse

with the date of each prenatal control as well as with special comments of the doc-
tor, for example, whether the woman is experiencing problems with the pregnancy.
This information represents a complement and a more objective measure than the
mothers' report of whether they had prenatal controls. Similarly, 36% reported having
had a tetanus vaccine. The tetanus vaccine was, during those years, the only vaccine
required to be given to pregnant women. It has a duration of 5 years and it is typically
administered to the pregnant woman in her second or third trimester.
4 Empirical strategy
We estimate three models. We first apply a difference-in-difference (DD) approach,
or more accurately, a Fuzzy difference-in-difference (De Chaisemartin and
d'Haultfoeuille 2018), exploiting differences in the intensity of the cholera epidemic
by month and region. Under certain conditions that we explain below, this model esti-
mate a Local Treatment Effect on the "switchers" or compliers. We collapse the data
at the region-month level and weight the regressions by the number of children born
alive per region and month. In Appendices A and B, we show the estimation using
total population as weights instead. Our main specification is the following:
t t + t + pm,t + 0m r +
where stands for the mortality rate as of July of 1993 (Census' interview date)
of children born alive in month m, and year t to women age 12 or more in 1993,
who at the time of the census lived in region r. Unfortunately, we do not know the
region of residence when a given woman was pregnant with her treated child but in
Appendices A and B we estimate our results using only children born to women who
did not relocate during the 5 years preceding the census (between 1988 and 1993),
and our results are very similar.
ChJrm t stands for the cholera incidence during the jth trimester in utero of the
child. For example, Ch
Ica,4, 1991 represents the 14-week incidence before April 15th,
1991 in the region of Ica. Our data does not provide day of birth, so we assume all
children were born on the 15th day of the month. Our data also does not provide
information on gestational age at birth, hence we assume 38 weeks of gestation and
we follow the medical literature regarding the definition of the trimesters: the first
trimester comprises weeks I to 10, the second trimester comprises weeks 1 1 to 24 and
the third trimester comprises weeks 25 to 38. Exposure to cholera, however, could
have reduced gestational age at birth. So, in Appendices A and B, we estimate our
regressions assuming 36 and 34 weeks of gestation.
The medical literature affirms that third trimester is the most sensitive for cholera
cases (Hirschhorn et al. 1969), but we also estimate the effect of exposure to cholera
during the other trimesters to confirm this previous result. In addition, we estimate
the effect of exposure to cholera in the first trimester after birth, because prenatal and
postnatal incidence of cholera might be correlated and postnatal exposure may also
have an effect on childhood mortality. Cholera incidence of further away periods is

less likely to be correlated with the incidence while in utero and less likely to affect
childhood mortality, since typically around half of childhood mortality happens soon
after birth. Finally, we additionally estimate the effect of exposure to cholera in the
trimester before conception, as a placebo test.
pm,t stands for month-year of birth fixed effects, Qnt r stands for month-region fixed
effect, d)rtrend stands region-specific trends, and stands for control variables:
ethnicity, number of children (which in this case is also the birth order), age, and
education of the mother, whether or not they have access to piped water, to a toilet or
cesspit, and average temperature and rainfall by trimester in utero. Standard errors are
clustered at the regional level. Since we only have data from 23 regions in the census
and 13 regions in the survey, we present the p-values of wild bootstrap inferences, to
correct for the small number of regions, following Cameron et al. (2008).
This empirical strategy addresses several potential sources of bias. First of all,
the regions fixed effects control for time-invariable regional variables that might be
correlated with cholera infection and childhood mortality. Second, the region-specific
trends control for the underlying trends in mortality, which were already increasing
during those years in most regions. The region-month of birth fixed effects control
for regional-specific seasonal variables that can be correlated with the intensity of
cholera and childhood mortality. Finally, the month and year birth effects control for
any potential nationwide shock that could affect mortality rates during those months.
Month and year birth effects also control for differences in mortality by children' age.
As with any other DD application, we assume that our results are not biased by
changes in unobservable variables that are correlated both with the cholera epidemic
and with childhood mortality. As a way to increase the credibility of this assumption,
in Appendix A we show with placebo regressions that our observable variables do
not vary meaningfully with the variation in cholera intensity that we exploit. We also
restrict the sample to those born by the first semester of 1991, with the objective of
including only children who were conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic and
in this way rule out the possibility that our results are generated by selective fertility.
In addition to the traditional assumptions, a Fuzzy-DD approach has two addi-
tional assumptions: a stable treatment effect over time and homogeneous treatment
effects for switchers of both treatment and comparison groups. Our comparison
group are region-months combinations that were affected by the cholera epidemic
in a smaller degree than the region-months combinations from treatment group.
In Appendix A, we relax these assumptions and estimate Intertemporal Treatment
Effects, following de Chaisemartin and D' Haultfoeuille (2020).
Our second model is an event study similar to that of Cutler et al. (2010) and Alpert
et al. (2018), among others. This non-parametric model allow us to test whether the
intensity of the cholera epidemic was greater in regions and months in which child-
hood mortality and our other outcomes were already growing. The following is our
event study specification:

P.l. Ritter, R.A. Sanchez
Ch
stands for cholera incidence corresponding to the last trimester in utero
of the child of region r born in month m of year 1991. Thus, #1991 gives us the effect
on mortality of a 1 percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children
who effectively were in utero in 1991, while Fl 990 gives us the effect on mortality of a
I percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children who were in utero
in 1990, a year before the epidemic started, ß1989 gives us the effect on mortality of a
I percentage point increase in cholera incidence for those children who were in utero
in 1989, 2 years before the epidemic started, and so forth. It is important to note that
even in the absence of pre-existing trends, for t < 1991 are not necessarily equal
to 0 , because they give us the effect on mortality of postnatal exposure to cholera.
However, the largest part of childhood mortality happens in the first year of life, and
so most of the children that die in our sample, has already died before their first
year of life, and so for t < 1991 should be noisier and probably smaller than the
effect of the exposure while in utero. More importantly, if the event study shows no
long-term trend in increasing mortality rates leading up to the cholera epidemic, then
that is evidence that our effects are not endogenously driven by omitted variables
correlated with the spread of the epidemic.
Finally, we estimate a third model with the survey data applying the same DiD
strategy but including a mother's fixed effects. Working with this data and empirical
strategy has advantages and disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that we have
considerably less statistical power for our estimations; first, we only exploit within-
sibling variation, second, the data contains a representative but small sample of the
population, and third, the data is divided in 13 larger regions, instead of the 23. Hence,
we lose much of the cross-sectional variation.
The main advantage of this augmented empirical strategy and additional data set
is that it removes several of the concerns that we have with our first model and data.
First of all, this model controls for selection at the mother's level. As we have seen
in the Introduction, while not even experts seemed to have anticipated the cholera
epidemic at that precise time, with our DD model we cannot completely discard the
possibility that the effects are driven by differences in the sample of women who gave
birth during the cholera epidemic. With this third model, however, we control for
such potential differences. Second, with the census data we estimate only the effect
on last-born child, hence should we not want to assume the same average treatment
effect between last-born and early-born children, our first model estimates a Local
Treatment Effect (LATE) on last-born children. With this third model and data, how-
ever, we include all children age 0 to 5, irrespective of whether or not they were last
born. I--lence the external validity of this model is greater. Third, since the data we use
to estimate this model was collected at the end of 1991 and at the beginning of 1992,
it reduces the likelihood that the region of residence is other than the native region
of children exposed to the epidemic. Finally, with this data we observe the age of
death, and hence we can estimate the effects on mortality by age of death. For more
robustness and sensitivity tests on this model, please see our Appendix B.
Before concluding this empirical section, we would like to make a final note about
our main regressor. Other studies use maternal infection rate as the main regressor,
for example Almond (2006). Unfortunately, we do not have mother's infection rate,
or infection by gender or age. However, we believe, our regressor, cholera incidence

at the regional level, is a more appropriate way to address our research question.
With the Covid-19 epidemic, we now know more than ever that an epidemic can
affect individuals not just through the disease itself but through other mechanisms.
We believe this is part of our contribution to the literature. By exploiting the variation
of the cholera incidence at the regional level we incorporate the potential effects
of, for example, the saturation of the health infrastructure of a region. This can be
particularly harmful for pregnant women that need attention several times during
their pregnancies and, of course, during the delivery. This is especially true in poor
countries, and was especially true during the cholera epidemic in Peru, as we have
seen above.
5 Results from census data
Table 3 presents the estimated effects of exposure to cholera on childhood mortality
according to different specifications. The first column shows the effects of estimat-
ing the difference-in-difference specification for the entire period between January
1984 and July 1993. We estimate the effect of the three trimesters in utero. All
regressions include birth month-year, and month-region fixed effects, region-specific
trends and control for ethnicity, birth order (or number of children born alive), age,
and education of the mother, whether they have access to piped water, to a toilet and
temperature and rainfall by trimester. p-values of wild bootstrap inferences shown
in parentheses and 95% confidence intervals shown in brackets. According to the
first column, exposure during the 3rd trimester has the greatest effect on childhood
mortality; an increase of 1 standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by 0.05 percentage
points, which represents and increase of 3% or 0.04 standard deviations. The med-
ical literature also affirms that the third trimester is the most sensitive for cholera
cases (Hirschhorn et al. 1969). We also find that an increase of 1 standard deviation
in the incidence of cholera during the first trimester in utero increases average child-
hood mortality rate by 0.02 percentage points, which represents and increase of 1.2%
or 0.02 standard deviations. Finally, we find that an increase of I standard deviation
in the incidence of cholera during the second trimester in utero decreases average
childhood mortality rate by 0.02 percentage points. This result might seem odd at
first, however this is actually possible; it could be the result of miscarriage and of
the surviving children being a healthier sub-set of the total cohort. "Selective mortal-
ity/miscarriage" has been noticed by many researchers (Bozzoli et al. 2007; Currie
and Vogl 2013). In fact, according to Saona et al. (1991), most miscarriages due to
cholera infection in Peru occurred during the first and second trimester of pregnancy.
In the rest of the columns, we estimate the same regression, but restricting our
data to the period between January 1984 and December 1991. By including only the
first year of the epidemic, we reduce the possibility of selective fertility. Moreover,
since the epidemic was quite unexpected when it appeared, but over time individuals,
in particular educated individuals, became aware of the illness and learned ways to
prevent it, we would expect that the effect is less likely to be endogenous in the first
year of the epidemic. In Appendices A and B, we restrict the sample even further

to those born by the first semester of 1991, with the aim of including only children
conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic. In column 2, we can see that the effect
of exposure to cholera during the third trimester remains statistically significant in
all the specifications. In the case of exposure to cholera during the second trimester,
the negative effect is no longer statistically significant, and in the case of exposure
to cholera during the first trimester, the coefficient is statistically significant only
in some of the specifications. Columns 3 and 4 show the estimates of exposure to
cholera only during the third and first trimester, respectively. In particular, we can
see that the estimate for the exposure during the third trimester is very insensitive
to controlling for the incidence during other trimesters. This result is not surprising
given that the intensity of cholera varied significantly within regions over time, even
within months, and given that we are working with census data and, therefore, have
good statistical power.
In column 5, we show the effect of exposure during the 38 weeks in utero, and
we can see a significant effect on mortality; an increase of 1 standard deviation in
the incidence of cholera during the 38 weeks in utero increases average childhood
mortality rate by 0.04 percentage points or 2%.
Column 6 includes the estimation of the effect of cholera during the first trimester
after birth. It is somewhat surprising that postnatal exposure during the first trimester
after birth does not affect childhood mortality rate. However, we need to keep in
mind that typically 40% of childhood deaths happen in the first month after birth,
and a third of neonatal deaths occur in the first day of life. This means that some
of the children in our sample were not actually exposed to postnatal incidence of
cholera, because they were already dead after the first month. In fact, we will see in
the next section that there is a significant effect on first-day mortality. Another expla-
nation could be that breastfeeding reduced babies' exposure to the epidemic. There
is evidence that mothers respond in this way to protect babies from contaminated
water (Keskin et al. 2017). This does not have to be a premeditated response, since
breastfeeding is very generalized during the first trimester of life.
Finally, in column 7 we include as a placebo, the estimation of the effect on mor-
tality of cholera during one trimester before conception. It is reassuring to find no
significant effect, but this result is not sufficient to prove causality. During the 1980s
and early 1990s, Peru was going through a very bad economic situation, including an
increase in infant mortality (Baird et al. 2011; Paxson and Schady 2005). Hence our
results could be driven by a previous trend. Figure 4 shows event study for exposure
during the third trimester and we can see, however, that there is no previous trend in
those regions and in those months with higher incidence of cholera in 1991 in com-
parison with the rest of regions and months. This result provides good evidence that
our estimation is causal. Moreover, Fig. 5 presents an event study of maternal edu-
cational attainment as a placebo test that provides evidence that there was no sample
selection in the mothers of children affected in greater magnitude by the epidemic. In
Appendix A, we show more placebo tests and robustness checks that increase even
further the reliability of our results. The event study for exposure during the first
trimester in Fig. 6 shows what we were observing in the regressions: a much noisier
and mostly non-significant effect on mortality.

estimates from the event study (normalized to O the coefficient of 1990) and 95% confidence intervals of

These results are most likely a lower bound estimate for several reasons: first,
the epidemic likely generated a sizable number of miscarriages, which tend to be
concentrated among those who are physically weakest, meaning the survivors will
tend to be a healthier subpopulation (Bozzoli et al. 2007; Currie and Vogl 2013).
Second, the epidemic killed a large number of adults, meaning pregnant women who
survived a cholera infection were probably the healthiest, and our sample does not
contain information on motherless children. Third, we do not have the age of death
for children and we observe only whether children have died before mid 1993, and
the epidemic started in 1991. Hence, we can only see whether the children affected
by the epidemic died at age 2.5 or before, and some children might have died after
reaching that age.

Table 4 shows heterogeneous effects by poverty. The level of poverty by district
is defined by the proportion of households with at least one unsatisfied basic need,
which was calculated by the INEI from the Census 1993. We define "poor districts"
as districts with a larger proportion of "poor" households than the median district. As
expected, the effect of exposure to cholera during the third trimester on mortality is
greater among poorer districts. Interestingly though, the effect of exposure to cholera
during the first trimester on mortality is greater among the less poor districts. This
last result could be derived from a smaller number of miscarriages among the less
poor districts, which in turn reduces the "selection" effect.
Table 4 also shows heterogeneous effects by maternal education. We define
women with "high educational attainment" as those women with educational attain-
ment higher than the median and women with "low educational attainment" as those
women with educational attainment lower than the median. Again, as expected, the
effect of exposure to cholera during the third trimester on mortality is greater among
children of less well-educated mothers.
6 Results from survey data
In this section, we present the results from the estimations using the survey Data
(DHS 1992). One of the shortcomings of this data, aside from the obvious fact that
it is a survey and, therefore, has significantly fewer observations than a census, is
that the configuration of regions in this data is different than in our cholera data and
in the census data; the country is divided in 13 larger regions, instead of the 25. We
thus, lose much of the cross-sectional variation. With this data, however, we have the
advantage of knowing the age of death, and we can estimate within-siblings effects.
Table 5 presents the estimated effects of exposure to cholera on mortality using this
data. In the first column we show the result of running the difference in difference,

just as we did with the census data. As expected, our estimate is significantly less
precise; the point estimate of exposure to cholera during the third trimester is approx-
imately 5 times larger, but it is not statistically significant. Columns 2 to 6 show the
effects of estimating the within-siblings effect, on total mortality, on mortality in the
first 3 months of life, on mortality in the first month of life and on first-day mortality
respectively. We concentrate on early life mortality only, because at the time of the
survey approximately half of the children born in 1991 were less than 6 months old.
We can see that including the mother fixed effect approximately triplicates the esti-
mate and limiting the age of death to 3 months or less increases the significance. We
find that an increase of I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last
trimester in utero increases three-month mortality by 1.1 percentage points or 31%
and first-day mortality rate by 0.7 percentage points or 70%. This last result is very
interesting and suggests that a significant part of the deaths might have occurred due
to complications at birth. The magnitude of the effects are large, but so are the con-
fidence intervals; the effects represents only 0.06 and 0.07 of a standard deviation of
three-month mortality and first-day mortality, respectively. Also this is a sample of
mothers less well educated, as we saw in the summary statistics.
Table 6 shows the effect of the epidemic on some fetal health indicators, following
Goodman-Bacon (2018): sex composition, low, and very low birth weight/size and
gestational age. Column 1 shows the effect on the sex composition of children born
alive. We do not observe a statistically significant effect on the probability of a child
being born female, but we cannot dismiss this possibility out of hand. Column 2
shows the effect on low birth weight. Unfortunately, only about half of households
answered this question. We do not find any significant effect on low birth weight (in
our data there are no children with a very low birth weight), nor any effect on the
perceived size of the baby at birth, as shown in columns 3 and 4 or in the likelihood
of being premature, as shown in column 5. In column 6, we follow Kling, Liebman,
and Katz (2007), Anderson (2008) and Hoynes et al. (2016) and construct a summary
indicator for "fetal health" with the objective of increasing the statistical power of
our estimation. This indicator is the simple average across standardized measures of
each component: low, and very low birth weight/size and whether the child was a
preterm baby. The standardization of each variable is made by subtracting the mean
and dividing by the standard deviation. Since all the indicators of fetal health are
negative, we multiply the indicator by —1 to get a positive indicator. We can see that
there is no significant effect on this indicator either.
Table 7 presents the estimated effects on prenatal investments. We find no signif-
icant effect on the number of prenatal visits but exposure to cholera during the third
trimester in utero reduces the probability of having an prenatal card, and of a mother
having had a tetanus shot in the last 5 years. Column 4 shows that exposure to cholera
during the third and first trimester in utero reduces the likelihood of an institutional
birth by 1.6 percentage points or 3%. In column 5, we construct another summary
indicator, this time for "prenatal investment" with the objective of increasing the
statistical power of our estimation. This indicator is the simple average across stan-
dardized measures of each component: number of prenatal visits, having an prenatal
card, having had a tetanus shot and institutional birth. The standardization of each
variable is made by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. We

find that I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last trimester in
utero decreases prenatal investment by 0.03 standard deviations. These results sug-
gest that childhood mortality, in particular first-day mortality could have been driven
at least in part by the lack of skilled care during pregnancy and birth.
With respect to the potential magnitude of the effect of prenatal investments on
mortality, the effects, for example, of institutional births on mortality rates esti-
mated by previous studies are significantly large: between 50% and 100% (Daysal
et al. 2015; Godlonton and Okeke 2016; Okeke and Chari 2018; Friedman and Keats
2019a, b). We find that I standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
last trimester in utero reduces institutional births by 1.6 percentage points. Based
on previous studies, we would expect an increase in mortality between 0.8 and 1.6
percentage points, which corresponds very closely to our estimates. I--lence, a large
proportion of the first-day mortality (and to a lesser extent 3-month mortality) could
be explained by the effect of the cholera epidemic on institutional births, and more
generally prenatal investments.
Table 8 shows the effects on some health indicators of surviving children at the
time of the interview. Columns I and 2 show no significant effect on being ill or
having at least one episode of diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the interview, respec-
tively. Column 3, however, shows that an increase of one standard deviation in the
incidence of cholera during the third trimester increases the likelihood of severe diar-
rhea (defined as diarrhea for at least 3 days) by 2.2 percentage points or 18%. Column
4 shows that an increase of one standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during
the first trimester decreases height for age by 0.05 standard deviations but column
5 shows no effect on the probability of the child being stunted. Columns 5 and 6
show that an increase of one standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the
first trimester decreases weight for age by 0.15 standard deviations and increases the
likelihood of being underweight by 2.87 percentage points or 26%, respectively.
Tables 9 and 10 show heterogeneous effects. In these tables, we do not show
the coefficients of the exposure to cholera during the second trimester in order to
save space and focus the attention on our main results. We cannot identify districts
in the survey data, which is why we cannot construct the heterogeneous effect by
poverty with this data, but in this data we observe maternal education and sex of the
child. Table 9 shows heterogeneous effects by education. The effects on total mortal-
ity estimated with the census data, 3-month mortality and severe diarrhea estimated
with the survey data are concentrated among children of less well-educated mothers.
The effect on prenatal investments, however, is larger for children of better educated
women, and the effect on 1st-day mortality does not show much difference by edu-
cation. One potential explanation for these results is that, on the one hand, the effects
on total mortality, 3-month mortality and severe diarrhea are mostly driven by the
impact of the disease while in utero, which presumably affected less well-educated
women to a greater degree. On the other hand, the effect on first-day mortality is
driven by a combination of the impact of the disease and the impact on prenatal
investments, and the latter presumably depends more on the saturation of the health
system in populated areas where women tend to be more educated.
A similar pattern can be seen in Table 10; the effects on 3-month mortality and
severe diarrhea are concentrated among female children. The effect on prenatal

investments, however, is larger for males, and the effect on 1st-day mortality does
not show much difference by sex. Larger results for females are not uncommon in
the fetal origins literature. This result is typically attributed to stronger fetal sur-
Vival for women, and a positive selection effect among surviving boys (Dagnelie
et al. 2018). There is not obvious explanation of why the effect of on prenatal invest-
ments seems larger for males, but again the lack of differential effect by sex on
first-day mortality might be explained by the fact that this mortality is driven by a
combination of the impact of the disease while in utero and the impact on prenatal
investments.
7 Magnitude of the effects and estimation of the additional deaths
from the epidemic
With the census data we find that a 1 percentage point incidence of cholera dur-
ing the last trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by 0.04
percentage points. With the survey data, results are much larger in magnitude but
also significantly less precise. Applying the same methodology, the point estimate
is approximately five times larger and it is not statistically significant. Applying
the fixed effect methodology, we find that I standard deviation in the incidence of
cholera during the last trimester in utero increases 3-month mortality rate by 1.1
percentage points. If we look at the effects in terms of standard deviations, the mag-
nitudes are not so different from each other: with the census data we find an increase
on total childhood mortality of 0.04 standard deviations, while with the survey data
we find an effect on three-month mortality of 0.06 standard deviations. Assuming
the difference between the census estimate and the survey estimate (using the same
methodology) give us the magnitude of the imprecision of the survey estimates, we
would expect that the true effect is five times smaller, that is approximately 0.2 per-
centage points or 6%. As a comparison, Jayachandran (2009) finds that the wildfires
in Indonesia during the 5 months in late 1997 and early 1998 caused an increase in the
under-three mortality rate of 10% (assuming half of the deaths were miscarriages),
Rocha and Soares (2015) find that I standard deviation increase in rainfall gener-
ates a decrease of 5% in infant mortality rate, and Banerjee and Maharaj (2020) find
that excessive heat during pregnancy (20 days on average) increases infant mortality
by 4%.
According to our estimation, the total number of children who died due to expo-
sure to the cholera epidemic while in their last trimester in utero was in the range
of 207 to 1036 of all youngest children born in 1991 that died by the age of 2.54
Extrapolating our result to all children born in 1991, we have a total of 305 to 1,526
extra deaths not estimated in the official number of cholera deaths of 1991, which
is 2,909. This means that the human cost of the epidemic was approximately 30%
larger, if also we take into account the effect of prenatal exposure on childhood mor-
tality. Moreover, the official total mortality rate due to postnatal exposure to the

cholera epidemic in Peru is 9 in every 100,000 inhabitants, while our estimated mor-
tality rate due to prenatal exposure is 150 in every 100,000 children who were born
alive in 1991. The striking difference in these numbers shows that in utero exposure
to an epidemic can be more deadly than postnatal exposure. Naturally, this will vary
from epidemic to epidemic; cholera might affect children in utero much more than
other diseases. Nevertheless, we have seen that lack of prenatal investment is also an
important driver of the effect on mortality. This means that even if the disease has no
direct effect on the fetus, the economic consequences of the epidemic as well as the
saturation of the health system can impose severe consequences in terms of childhood
mortality.
8 Concluding remarks
Epidemics have been on the rise for the past several decades and will likely continue
to do so in the near future. Much of the economic literature has focused on the conse-
quences of viral outbreaks (Influenza, 1--11 V, Ebola, Covid19), in spite of the fact that
the number of bacterial outbreaks have increased as much as have the number of viral
outbreaks, and the two most common outbreaks in the last two decades have been
bacterial outbreaks: Salmonellosis and cholera (Smith et al. 2014). Poor countries,
in particular, are highly vulnerable to bacterial infections given the high prevalence
of antibiotic resistance (WHO 2018) and more generally, given their lack of access
to basic health services, clean water and sanitation (WB 2017). In this study we find
that an increase in 1 standard deviation in the incidence of cholera during the last
trimester in utero increases average childhood mortality rate by approximately 5%,
according to our most conservative estimate. This means that the human cost of the
epidemic was approximately 30% larger, if we consider the effect of prenatal expo-
sure on postnatal childhood mortality. Moreover, the official mortality rate from the
cholera epidemic in Peru, during 1991, is 9 in every 100,000 inhabitants, while our
estimated mortality rate due to prenatal exposure is 150 in every 100,000 children
that were born alive in 1991.
We further find that the epidemic increased first-day mortality and reduced prenatal
care and institutional deliveries and that later mortality is concentrated among girls. Addi-
tionally, we find that surviving children are more likely to suffer from severe diarrhea,
have lower weight for age, and are more likely to be underweight. These results
provide evidence that prenatal investments, in particular prenatal care and institu-
tional deliveries, can act as mediators between the in utero shock and the effect
on childhood mortality, and possibly also on surviving children's health status, and
even longer-term outcomes. Epidemics in particular, but also many other shocks that
have been analyzed in the fetal origins literature (droughts, wars, famines and hurri-
canes among other things) have the potential to affect access to skilled care during
pregnancy and birth, hence, the results of this paper can apply to a wide range of
shocks.

Appendix A. Robustness—difference-in-difference model—census
data
This section presents placebo estimates and sensitivity analysis to further increase
the reliability of the results estimated with our first model. In these tables, we do not
show the coefficients of the exposure to cholera during the second trimester in order
to save space and focus the attention on our main results. Table 11 tests whether
mothers who gave birth in regions and times affected by the cholera epidemic are
different from the rest of mothers in several observable variables. Columns I to 4 of
show that there is no significant correlation between the variation of the epidemic
that we exploit and the maternal educational attainment in years and levels, with the
probability of a mother to be illiterate and with mother's age. In column 5, we observe
a negative relationship with respect to the probability of the mother of being indige-
nous, however, this correlation attenuates the effect of the epidemic on childhood
mortality, since childhood mortality was larger among indigenous mothers exposed
to the epidemic.
Columns 1 and 2 of Table 12 test whether access to piped water and a toilet or
cesspit (as opposed to open defecation) are correlated with the spread of the disease.
We find no significant correlation between these variables and the variation of the
epidemic that we exploit. Unfortunately we do not have access to variables regarding
sanitation at the time of the epidemic, only at the time of the census (2 years after the
epidemic broke up), but it is still reassuring to see no significant correlation. These
results are maybe unsurprising, since at the regional level and over time, and at least
in the first year, the abruptness and severity of the epidemic, as well as the speed
of contagion, make the geographical proximity of the regions to the initial cases the
main drivers of the disease.
Columns 3 and 4 of Table 12 present other placebos for the correlation with the
number of children born alive per mother and on the size of the cohort of "last chil-
dren" born alive. Pregnancy rates could have decreased as a response to the cholera
epidemic. We can see, however, that there is a statistically significant correlation with
the total number children born alive per women, but the correlation is positive and
very small. This result is not surprising given that most children in our sample were
conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic. Moreover, we will see below that our
results remain very similar even when we limit the sample to those children born
in the first semester of 1991, that is conceived before the outbreak of the epidemic.
Finally, the exposure to the cholera outbreak while in utero may have reduced the
probability that a family replace a lost child and this, in turn, would bias our results
on mortality. If that were the case, exposure to cholera would reduce the number of
all the children born alive and would increase size of the cohort of "last children"
born alive. As we have seen above, there is no negative correlation between expo-
sure to cholera during the third trimester and the number of all children born alive,
nor is there any positive correlation with the size of the cohort of "last children"
born alive..
Finally, Table 13 tests whether temperature are rainfall were correlated with the
spread of the disease. Column 1 reveals that there is no significant correlation

between temperature in the third trimester in utero and the variation of the epi-
demic that we exploit in that same trimester. Likewise, column 2 reveals that there
is no significant correlation between temperature in the first trimester in utero and
the variation of the epidemic that we exploit in that same trimester. Columns 3
and 4 show rainfall is indeed positively correlated with cholera incidence. Never-
theless, including or not rainfall as a control in our regressions has virtually no
effect in our results except for additional statistical significance in some of our esti-
mates. The lack of sensitivity of our results to the inclusion on temperature and
rainfall as control variables is in part due to the inclusion of month-region fixed
effects in our regressions, which diminish the role of seasonal factors on childhood
mortality.
We test the sensitivity of our results to other specifications and samples, including
children born to women who did not relocate to a different district during the 5 years
preceding the census (between 1988 and 1993), and our results are very similar. We
also show that the estimated effect on mortality is concentrated on those children
born in the first half of 1991, that is, those who were already in utero when the
epidemic broke out. Please, refer to Tables A.4 and A.5 of the working paper (Ritter
and Sanchez 2020) to see these results.
As we mentioned in Section 4, a Fuzzy-DD approach has two important and
somewhat strong assumptions: a stable treatment effect over time and homoge-
neous treatment effects for switchers of both treatment and comparison groups. We
relax these assumptions and estimate Intertemporal Treatment Effects following de
Chaisemartin and D' Haultfceuille (2020) and exploiting the Stata command "Did-
Multiplegt" (de Chaisemartin et al. 2019). Please, refer to Figure A.I to Figure A.3
and Table A.6 of the working paper (Ritter and Sanchez 2020) to see these results.
This exercise shows that the Fuzzy-DiD assumptions are too strong for our setting
but the bias seems to go against our results. Since, our Fuzzy-DiD model is more
conservative and it has more statistical power we keep it as the main specification of
the study.
Appendix B. Robustness survey data
Table 14 presents placebo regressions for the correlation with birth order, tempera-
ture and rainfall. We do not observe any significant correlation. Additionally, we test
the sensitivity of our results to other specifications. Please, refer to Tables B.2 to B. 7
of the working paper (Ritter and Sanchez 2020) to see these results. Our main results
are very robust to the different specifications. Finally, we do not find any signifi-
cant effect of exposure to cholera during the first trimester after birth or during one
trimester before conception.

ABSTRACT
Background The standard treatment for gestational choriocarcinoma is chemotherapy.
Objective: To describe the risk of recurrence with expectant management of gestational choriocarcinoma that has
reached a normal human chorionic gonadotropin level after tumor removal without adjuvant chemotherapy.
Methods: A retrospective multicenter international cohort study was conducted from 1981 to 2017 involving 11
gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers with patient's follow-up extended until 2023. Clinical and
biological data of included patients were extracted from each center's database. The inclusion criteria were i)
histological diagnosis of gestational choriocarcinoma in any kind of placental tissue retrieved, ii) spontaneous
normalization of human chorionic gonadotropin level following choriocarcinoma retrieval, iii) patient did not
receive any oncological treatment for the choriocarcinoma, iv) and at least 6 months of follow-up after the first
human chorionic gonadotropin level normalization.
Results: Among 80 patients with retrieved gestational choriocarcinoma and whose human chorionic gonado-
tropin level normalized without any other oncological therapy, none had a recurrence of choriocarcinoma after a
median follow-up of 50 months. The median interval between choriocarcinoma excision and human chorionic
gonadotropin level normalization was 48 days. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics/
World Health Organization risk score was in 93.7% of the cases.
Conclusions: This multicenter international study reports that selected patients with gestational choriocarcinoma
managed in gestational trophoblastic disease reference centers did not experience any relapse when the initial
tumor evacuation is followed by human chorionic gonadotropin level normalization without any additional
treatment. Expectant management may be a safe approach for highly selected patients.

1. Introduction
Gestational trophoblastic diseases (GTD) encompass, among others,
premalignant complete and partial hydatidiform moles, and malignant
lesions called gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN), one of which is
gestational choriocarcinoma (GCC). GCC is a rare and aggressive GTN
subtype with a high metastatic potential. Although most GCC occur after
a molar pregnancy, they can also be found after any other kind of
pregnancy, i.e. ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage or term delivery. The
incidence of GCC is estimated to be approximately
term pregnancies and 1:40 complete hydatidiform mole [
1,2].
Standard treatment of GCC is chemotherapy, with a regimen based
on the tumor's risk profile. An International Federation of Gynecology
and Obstetrics (FIGO)/World Health Organization (WHO) scoring sys-
tem based on eight prognostic factors has been established to evaluate
the risk of resistance to single agent chemotherapy [3]. Low-risk tumors,
i.e. with a FIGO/WHO risk score lower or equal to 6, are treated with
single agent chemotherapy; whereas high-risk tumors, i.e. with a FIG-
O/WHO risk score higher than 6, are treated with multiagent chemo-
therapy [4]. Monitoring serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is
used as a reliable tumor biomarker.
The early initiation of low-risk GTN adequate treatment is associated
with a 5-year survival rate of 98% [5,6]. However, the histology of
choriocarcinoma is predictive of a decreased effectiveness of first-line
single agent treatments compared to post-mole GTN [7—9]. It has been
suggested that patients with histopathological evidence of choriocarci-
noma and a FIGO/WHO risk score of 5 or 6 may benefit from upfront
multiagent chemotherapy in case of pre-treatment hCG level > 150,000
mlU/mL or metastatic disease [10].
The diagnostic confirmation of GCC often requires expert histo-
pathological review, which may delay the final pathological diagnosis.
During this reviewing interval, hCG level can decline spontaneously and
eventually normalize without additional therapy.
The objective of this international study conducted in GTD reference
centers was to assess the recurrence rate of GCC after primary complete
tumor removal followed by hCG normalization without adjuvant
therapy.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
This retrospective multicenter international cohort study involved
11 GTD reference centers (
) affiliated to the International Society
Fig. 1
for the Study of Trophoblastic Diseases (ISSTD) [11]. Patients treated
between 1981 and 2017 were included. Clinical, biological and outcome
data of included patients were extracted from each center's database.
Follow-up was extended until April 2023.

Patients registered in trophoblastic diseases reference centers pro-
vided informed consent for anonymous data analysis and storage in local
databases and informed consent was waived if deidentified and anony-
mized records were reviewed, with institutional review board approval
or ethics committees of the respective participating centers approval
where required (B322201214659).
2.2. Patients' enrollment
Patients were included in this study if they were diagnosed with GCC
in any kind of pathology specimen: second/third trimester placenta,
product of curettage, uterus, fallopian tube or metastasis resection.
Ovarian choriocarcinomas were included only if molecular genotyping
proved the gestational origin. Referent pathologists of each center have
systematically reviewed all initial histological diagnoses. At least 1
normal serum hCG level following GCC removal without any additional
treatment was necessary. Patients who received a single methotrexate
injection for an initial context of a suspected ectopic pregnancy prior to
the diagnosis of GCC were not excluded from the study. At least 6
months of follow-up at one of the reference centers after the first
normalized hCG level was required.
Patients with a previous history of GCC cured by chemotherapy or
patients with non-gestational choriocarcinoma were excluded.
Patients with metastatic disease were not excluded from the study.
2.3. Initial workup and management of gestational choriocarcinoma
Along with clinical history and physical examination, an initial im-
aging workup was performed at the time of GCC diagnosis for the
anatomical staging. It was considered complete if it included imaging of
all the following anatomical regions: pelvis (ultrasound or MRI),
abdomen (CT scan or ultrasound), and chest (X-ray for FIGO score ± CT
scan) imaging. Brain evaluation (CT scan or MRI) was performed
selectively in women with suspected distant lesions.
The FIGO/WHO risk score was calculated for each patient, based on
available data. For the item "antecedent pregnancy", in the absence of
molecular genotyping, we considered either the current term pregnancy
for intraplacental choriocarcinoma or the last known pregnancy. When
the patient reported no previous pregnancy, we scored missed abortion
by default.
For the item "interval from index pregnancy", we used the interval
between last known pregnancy termination and the excision of
choriocarcinoma.
We defined the first hCG value available as the item "pre-treatment
hCG". Since the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma was not suspected at the
time of placental removal in most cases, first hCG level was measured
after tumor evacuation for 47.5% of patients (n 38), which may have
underestimated the FIGO/WHO risk score.

For the item "largest tumor size", we used the size on gross patho-
logical examination or tumor size on pelvic imaging when the patho-
logical size was not available.
Disease recurrence was defined as rising hCG level after initial
normalization confirmed after 2 weeks, in the absence of a new
concomitant pregnancy [12]
Follow-up duration was calculated from the first normal serum hCG
level to the last known hCG level.
3. Results
3.1. Center and patient characteristics
Eleven international trophoblastic diseases reference centers partic-
ipated in this study. Rio de Janeiro-Brazil, Lyon-France, Sheffield-United
Kingdom, London-United Kingdom, Montréal-Canada, Liege-Belgium,
Nijmegen-Netherlands, Geneve-Switzerland, Stockholm-Sweden, Bos-
ton-USA, and Cork-Ireland. Eighty patients with a pathological diagnosis
of GCC and normalized hCG level were included.
shows the
Fig. 1
number of patients per center and the year of registration.
The diagnosis of GCC was made in 37.5% of women after uterine
curettage (n 30), in 26.3% after hysterectomy (n — 21), in 17.5% after
delivery in the placenta (n 14), in 15% in the fallopian tube (n 12)
and in 3.8% after metastatic resection (lung n — 2, kidney n — 1).
Two patients received two injections of 50 and 75 mg methotrexate
respectively, for suspected ectopic pregnancy.
The clinical characteristics of patients according to the type of tumor
excision are summarized in

years (range 17—54). The median time between the index pregnancy and
the GCC diagnosis was 50 days (range 0—8030). The median first hCG
level available was 1543 mlU/mL (range 0—223,591). The estimated
tumor size was <3 cm for 81% of cases (n 53/65), and 6% (n 4/65)
had a tumor size > 5 cm. Tumor measurements were not available for 15
patients. The majority of patients had FIGO stage I (n 62, 77.5%) or II
(n 14, 17.5%) disease. Five patients presented with metastatic lesions
on imaging. In 2 patients, multiple lung lesions were described on chest
CT scan performed after hysterectomy. One patient presented with a 4
cm cervical mass, after intraplacental choriocarcinoma excision. None of
these 3 patients received chemotherapy since their hCG spontaneously
fell rapidly after primary treatment. The remaining 2 patients with
metastasis on imaging workup presented with a unique lung lesion

corresponding to the excised GCC.
The FIGO/WHO risk scores ranged from O to 9 (
Fig. 2
): O in 3 patients
(3.8%), 1 in 18 patients (22.5%), 2 in 33 patients (41.3%), 3 in 13 pa-
tients (16.3%), 4 in 1 patient (1.3%), 5 in 3 patients (3.8%), 6 in 4 pa-
tients (5%) and greater than 6 in 5 patients (6.3%).
Due to normalized hCG level at the time of the diagnosis, and in the
absence of symptoms, imaging work-up was not always exhaustive.
Imaging workup could be considered as complete in 70% (n — 56) of
cases. For example, two patients with intraplacental choriocarcinoma
had for example no imaging since the hCG level was already normalized
at the time of diagnosis.
All cases were validated by an experienced team in gestational
trophoblastic reference centers. Anatomopathological review, imaging
work-up and scoring FIGO may lead to a time laps between surgery and
treatment decision. Expectant management was decided in case of
spontaneous normalization hCG in this interval. Omission of chemo-
therapy was never due to patient refusal or medical contraindication.
3.2. Recurrence rate
After a median follow-up of 50 months (range 6—411 months), none
of the 80 patients experienced a GCC recurrence.

3.3. Characterization of hCG normalization
Pre-evacuation serum hCG levels were available in 52.5% cases (n
42) with a median value of 20,058 mlU/mL (range 161-223,591). Me-
dian post-evacuation hCG level was 182 mlU/mL (range 0—86,283) and
was measured after a median interval of 14 days (range 1 day—9
months).
The median interval between GCC primary removal and hCG
normalization was 48 days (range 2—323). For 80% of the patients, hCG
level had normalized within 3 months post-removal. Statistical analysis
showed a correlation between first hCG post-evacuation level and time
to normalization (Pearson's correlation coefficient r 0.44; p < .0001).
First hCG post-evacuation level accounts for 19.16% (r2 — 0.442
0.1936) of total variability of necessary time to tumor marker normal-
ization. High first hCG post-evacuation levels were therefore associated
with a longer interval for hCG normalization (
Fig. 3)
Among patients with intraplacental choriocarcinoma, 66% (n 10/
15) had normal values at their first hCG measurement.
4. Discussion
4.1. Principal findings
This multicentre international study shows no relapses of GCC after
primary complete evacuation followed by hCG level normalization,
without any additional treatment. These results highlight the opportu-
nity to avoid chemotherapy exposure in highly selected patients.
4.2. Results in the context of published literature
The centralization of care in expert GTD centers has contributed to
the improvement of GCC management in terms of treatment morbidity
and mortality [6,13]. The process of histopathological review in these
reference centers requires time and is associated with a delay between
specimen evacuation, final diagnosis of GCC and treatment initiation. In
several cases, hCG level normalizes within this time interval. Manage-
ment of patients with normal tumor marker level and no evidence of
residual disease after GCC removal is a particularly controversial issue.
Some published data leave open the question whether non-
500 1000
metastatic GCC should be managed with

immediate chemotherapy [
]. Very limited data are available on
the specific subset of patients with normalized hCG level after GCC
evacuation. It is not clear if postponing chemotherapy is an
undertreatment.
A retrospective study compared expectant management versus im-
mediate chemotherapy for low-risk and non-metastatic GCC [15]. In this
population, 55.3% of patients managed by surveillance only achieved
complete sustained remission. Interestingly, among the 12 cases with
normalized hCG level, no patient required chemotherapy, which is
concordant with our observation.
Regarding the specific condition of intraplacental choriocarcinoma,
a systematic review, considering 29 non-metastatic cases, showed no
relapse in 24 out of 25 patients managed by surveillance only [14].
However, it is not clear which criteria were applied to decide between
prophylactic chemotherapy or simple surveillance. The authors of this
study recommend to avoid adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with
non-metastatic disease and normal hCG level, but lifelong hCG moni-
toring is required.
The population of the present study is heterogeneous in terms of
pregnancy gestational age (first, second or third trimester) and meta-
static status. Moreover, 28% of patients were older than 40 years old,
which is a known risk factor for resistance to monochemotherapy in the
treatment of GCC.
The duration of post-normalized hCG monitoring is still debated after
chemotherapy for GTN. Published data show that most recurrent GTN
appear in the first year of follow-up, regardless of the FIGO/WHO score
risk [
]. Recurrent GCC occurs usually within the 3 years [
19]. The
17,18
consensus is to follow-up patients for at least 1 year after cessation of
therapy, though with some centers advocating up to 10 years of
follow-up [
]. In the present study, the median follow-up was 4
17-20
years, which is in accordance with practice in most centers and allows
the diagnosis of the vast majority of recurrences.
4.3. Strengths and limitations
The strengths of this study are the multicentric international design
and the involvement of recognized expert trophoblastic diseases centers
with systematic histopathological review. This cohort of 80 patients is
the largest cohort available in the literature in this very restricted sub-
group of patients.
We also acknowledge some limitations, such as the retrospective
design. FIGO scores were calculated thanks to available data, sometimes
without knowing the index pregnancy, since genotyping is not routinely
done. Our conclusions should therefore be interpreted with caution and
the "surveillance only" decision must be validated in a multidisciplinary
expert GTD center to avoid metastatic disease as a deleterious conse-
quence of postponing chemotherapy.
4.4. Clinical and research implications
Our results highlight the consideration of an expectant approach in
highly selected cases of GCC when the hCG level falls and eventually
normalizes after complete tumor removal, especially in early stage Iow-
risk disease. These results need to be validated in a larger and pro-
spective study. In the future, it may change the FIGO recommendation to
initiate chemotherapy in all cases of GCC histology. This management
should always be validated by an experienced team in gestational
trophoblastic reference centers.
5. Conclusions
This international multicenter study shows that patients with a pri-
mary diagnosis of GCC managed in GTD reference centers do not relapse
when the initial tumor excision is followed by a normalization of hCG
level without adjuvant treatment. These results, however, should be
interpreted with some reservation as they only concern a selected cohort

ABSTRACT
Background: Maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality depend on identifying of pregnancy risks
and risk management. There is a dearth of information about the experiences of high-risk pregnant
mothers in self-mitigation of the risk in the socio-cultural setting of Iran. This research was conducted
to explore the risk management experiences of high-risk pregnant mothers.
Methods: This Qualitative study was conducted in educational hospitals in Mashhad, Iran, from July
2018 to December 2020. The purposive sampling method was used to recruit the participants based on
medical or obstetric high-risk conditions in pregnancy. Qualitative data were obtained from in-depth
and semi-structured 29 interviews. Mothers' experiences of pregnancy in a risky condition were
asked, and the interview continued until data saturation. Data were analyzed using the MAXQDA 10
software and the Elo and Kyngäs method.
Results: Maternal experiences for risk management in pregnancy were formed by nine sub-categories
and three categories: the excitement of emotion including: "feeling worry and despair", "gladness
in the shadow of hope and optimism", "momentary shocking and excitement", and "inactivity and
helplessness"; self-contemplation including: "active analysis of the ways of moderating the risk",
"cognitive denial", and "ignoring the risk"; and witnessed action including: "problem-focused and
rational actions", and "avoidance and inefficient engagements".
Conclusion: Risk management experiences of pregnant women with high-risk pregnancies include a
wide range of positive and negative feelings, effective and ineffective thoughts, and behaviors. Mutual
collaboration between mothers and midwives/obstetricians by providing high-quality risk management
counseling can lead to choosing effective risk management strategies.

INTRODUCTION
A high-risk pregnancy (HRP) refers to
pregnancies in which the mother or the fetus has
an increased risk of complications compared to
uncomplicated pregnancies.l Besides maternal
death, fetal complications (e.g., fetal death,
premature delivery, low birth weight) and other
poor outcomes more likely increase due to
HRP.2 The prevalence ofl--IRPs in Iran and other
countries ranges from 25.6% to 75.60/0.3'4 In the
past, it was not recommended for childbearing
in high-risk conditions due to the mother and
baby with more complications. Recent advances
in medical treatments have enabled many
women with chronic illnesses to get pregnant
and experience motherhood.5
Women's risk perception affects decision-
making and behavior in pregnancy.6' 7 This
means that mothers must control their
environment, diet, activity, and any risk for
raising their chances of fulfilling the goal of
childbearing.7 A qualitative study of pregnant
women in Iran found that challenges of
family, anticipation for motherhood, future
pregnancies, and challenge of adaptation in
pregnancy were experiences of high-risk
pregnant women. 8 Many pregnant women with
hypertensive disorders felt that they weren't
well informed of management decisions
and had a desire to be involved in decision-
making.9 A study found that thoughts and
feelings about safety, the physical environment
and the perceived psychological influence
of the location of birth are the factors that
women consider when deciding on place of
birth process.10 Barriers to management of
diabetes during pregnancy were financial
barriers to maintaining a healthy diet and
exercising, communication difficulties, lack
of social support, and barriers related to
diabetes care.ll A grounded theory study has
found becoming the best mom that I can be
is a complex process. Women need to rebuild
the self and regain control of their lives. This
process needs reorganization of the problem,
dealing with their shame and embarrassment,
identifying an understanding healthcare
58
provider, and considering the consequences
of the depression and its management.12 A
systematic research finding recommended
that the maternal health experiences should
be highlighted, particularly when it comes to
decision making about care.13
Despite the fact that pregnancy outcome
will be safer with risk management, no
qualitative study to investigate management
of risk in high risk pregnant Iranian women
has been conducted in Iran. One study
evaluated Risk Management Model of Iran's
Health System.14 According to the Ministry
of Health and Medical Education statistics in
Iran, HRPs were cared with standard practice
set by the reference books as a single policy
across Iran.15 HRP management includes
medical interventions and supportive cares.
Experiences during HRP have a unique
meaning for the person.16 The researcher's
experience indicates that prenatal care is
carried out based on standards and without
considering the views and opinions of
mothers in Iran. Therefore, mothers may
not act correctly when the recommendations
and the mother's point of view conflict,
which is dangerous for the mother's health.
Mother's desire is to preserve the health of
the fetus and herself. The experiences and
behaviors of Iranian pregnant women with
regard to the management of HRP remain
mainly unexplored. Understanding this matter
and aligning the prenatal care according to
the mother's discretion can be beneficial in
advancing or improving the health of the
mother and the fetus in HRPs. The choice
for a qualitative study is its effectiveness in
obtaining the perceptions and experiences and
understanding concerns and feelings of people
with health issues.17 The present qualitative
study was conducted to better understand the
experiences of women with HRP regarding
the management of risk during pregnancy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The current qualitative study which used the
content analysis approach was conducted on 25
ijcbnm.sums.ac.ir


women with HRPs from July 2018 to December
2020 in Mashhad, Iran. The participants were
selected using a purposeful sampling method of
the women referred to educational hospitals (18
participant) and health centers (7 participant) in
Mashhad, and the sampling continued until data
saturation. The inclusion criteria were Iranian
women with HRP based on the obstetrician's
diagnosis and standard definition of HRP,I
outpatient condition, willingness to contribute to
their experience, and ability to speak Persian and
communicate verbally to provide the researcher
with complete information. The exclusion
criteria were congenital fetal abnormalities
during the pregnancy or unwillingness to
continue the study.
The data were gathered through 29 in-depth
semi-structured face-to-face interviews with
25 participants until data saturation. The
interviews took place in a private and quiet
room in a hospital or healthcare center, each
lasting from 25 to 50 minutes. The interviews
were conducted by corresponding author
after obtaining informed written consent.
Sampling continued until data saturation, i.e.,
no new data or new category was acquired.
The interview started with general questions
such as:
"What was your experience of
pregnancy?" "How do you feel during this
pregnancy?" "What have you done during
this
Do you think these actions
are enough?" "What else have you done
differently than other pregnant women?"
"What else have you done to maintain this
pregnancy?" The interview continued then
with open questions: "Can you explain more
about the ways you have tried so far to save
this pregnancy?" and "Which medical
recommendations are acceptable to you?" All
interviews were recorded after the permission
of the participants and obtaining their written
informed consent.
The data were analyzed concurrently
with data collection using the conventional
content analysis method, as described by Elo
and Kyngäs (2008).18 The analysis consists
of three phases: preparing, organizing, and
IJCBNM January 2023; Vol 11, No 1
Risk management in high-risk pregnancy
reporting. In the preparation phase, the
researcher (corresponding and first author)
listened to all of the interviews, transcribed
them verbatim, and studied the text to gain
an in-depth understanding (immersion) of
the data repeatedly. The organization stage
included the selection of meaning units and
codes, reduction and compression process of
similar codes, appearance of subcategories,
and finally, the abstraction process to form the
main categories. The final list of categories
was formulated with a joint effort by all the
research team members after multiple joint
meetings and agreed upon by all group
members. The final stage consisted of
reporting the extracted categories.
For data trustworthiness, the Lincoln and
Guba method (1985) was assessed, which
included the four criteria of credibility,
dependability,
transferability,
and
confirmability.19 To ensure the credibility
of the data, the researcher thought about it
continuously (engagement with the data).
The coded texts were made available to
other members of the research team for
validation, were also given to participants
and were asked to revise the researcher's
correct understanding of their experiences
(member check re-interview). Data were
evaluated to ensure dependability constantly.
To express the transferability, information
such as demographic characteristics,
interview techniques, data collection
methods, researcher's observations, and the
data analysis process were fully provided in
the present study. To achieve confirmability,
all stages of the study, data collection
and data analysis, were continuously
meticulously documented from beginning
to the end. For data management, the
MaxQDA software (version 10.0) was used.
The present research was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Mashhad University
of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran (code:
IR.MUMS.REC.1396.276). The participants
were informed about the purpose and
methodology and confidentiality of the
information. Participants were permitted to
59


Khadivzadeh T, Shojaeian Z, Sahebi A
withdraw from the study for any reason at any
time without any change in their pregnancy
care process.
RESULTS
A total of 25 mothers with HRP, aged 17 to 40
years, participated in the study. The demographic
characteristics of the participants are listed in
Table 1. Analysis of the 29 interviews resulted
in 118 extracted codes, and after exclusion of
the duplicate codes, a total of 20 main codes
remained. These codes were classified into nine
sub-categories and three main categories, as
shown in Table 2.
l. The Excitement of Emotion
l.a. Feeling Worry and Despair
Worry was the first emotion of most
mothers when facing the risks that they were
going to experience in their pregnancies.
Expressing worry and despair depended on
the type of risk factor in mothers as chronic
diseases and the presence of several risk
factors concurrently. The possibility of
infertility was a vague concern about the
family consequences added to the worries
about pregnancy.
"I kept telling myself that it's my problem;
we can't have children, so I have to bear it...
Then, I said that the people around me (my
mother-in-law) might say after a few years
why you don't have children. " (PS)
For some of the participants, the problems
encountered in previous pregnancies were
repeated and resulted in poor pregnancy
outcomes; the feeling of despair prevailed
over other emotions.
"Every time I tell myself this time my
pregnancy will be successful, but as soon as
my bleeding starts again, I tell myself that
I won't get pregnant again. I can't do it
anymore; how many more times will I have
to get pregnant and will it be futile?" (P 18)

l.b. Gladness in the Shadow of Hope and
Optimism
If controlling the risk was possible from the
doctor's point of view, physicians permitted
the mothers to get pregnant despite the risk.
These mothers tried to regain peace with hope
in God, joy with positivity in pregnancy, and
peace of mind with a healthy pregnancy.
"As soon as the doctor allowed me to
get pregnant, it was enough for me, I left
the gladness behind ... I believe that in
this pregnancy, God got me that so far no
problem has happened, so God will care for
me afterwards as well; this gives me peace. '
(P11)
l.c. Momentary Shocking and Excitement
If mothers hear stressful news, they are
shocked. Hearing about the possibility of
not getting pregnant or the threat to the
health of the fetus, such as the possibility of
abnormality, abortion, or death of the fetus,
without any background, they immediately
had a quick shock reaction.
'When the doctor said that I can't get
pregnant with myoma and uterine surgery
and they might remove the uterus, I just cried.
It wasn 't my fault; I just cried out loud. " (P20)
IJCBNM January 2023; Vol 11, No 1
I.d. Inactivity and Helplessness
Mothers with chronic diseases and
frequent history of poor outcomes in previous
pregnancies needed more treatments, costs
and were exposed to more drug side effects.
These repeatable and boring measurements
caused the feeling of fatigue and helplessness
with pregnancy, so they did not do anything
else due to the feeling of helplessness in some
stages of treatment.
"I have to take an injection every day;
my body gets hives. No matter what I do,
the itching doesn't go away; it bothers me.
I couldn't find the drug sometimes. It's very
expensive, and now it's still five months,
I'm really wearied ...Sometimes I don't do
anything anymore". (P 18)
2. Self-contemplation
2.a. Active Analysis of the Ways of Moderating
the Risk
Some participants thought about the risk
adjustment methods for themselves. Each
mother evaluated the solutions according to
the ability in her personal and family life.
"My biggest worry is during childbirth. I
thought to myself if I can take someone with
me as a companion, if I have a caesarean
61


Khadivzadeh T, Shojaeian Z, Sahebi A
section, if I give birth to my baby painlessly,
or whether I can go to the city where I work,
where they will know me more". (P6)
Some mothers used to bear the problems
more easily hoping for the future of pregnancy
and imagining the joys of the child in the
future as one strategy.
'When my asthma bothers me, I think, I
will start planning for happiness and a new
life right now, and not to be boring for myself
and my husband. " (P II)
Some mothers were investigating possible
alternative solutions to reach the desired
number of children.
"Until now, no one told me that I could use
a surrogate. I said to myself when I can get
pregnant myself why a surrogate,
1
will definitely look for other methods. " (P 15)
2.b. Cognitive Denial
Some mothers did not believe in the
importance of the risk. In their opinion, there
was no difference between them, and the other
mothers compared themselves with other low-
risk mothers. They did not need to take more
care.
'I do the same things as other mothers
who get pregnant; I go to the doctor, I do the
tests, I don't need to do anything else. " (P l)
2.c. Ignoring the Risk
Some mothers desired to continue
childbearing despite the risk, they comforted
themselves and tried to reduce the risk in their
minds to help themselves and then take action.
"When I'm very worried, I say to myself
that there are many pregnant women whose
conditions are much worse than me. For
example, one of them had had six cesarean
sections so far, and nothing happened, so
there will be no problem for me either; I know
everything myself and should be careful. " (P24)
Some mothers believed that childbearing
was the only way to achieve what they wanted,
and there was no other way for them; they felt
compelled to get pregnant despite the risk.
Therefore, the risk does not matter against
the desire.
62
"If I hadn't been get pregnant, I wouldn't
have been able to do anything else with my
life instead of having a baby. My husband
wanted a child and... being bothered during
pregnancy is not very important for saving
my life. " (P 16).
3. Witnessed Action
3.a. "Problem-focused and Rational Actions
Mothers showed various actions in
encountering to HRPs. The practical solution
for many mothers was to try all possible
solutions as using peer experiences, relevant
support, and alternative solutions. Every
mother chose the method that was possible
and effective for her and tried to make it easier
for herself to bear the risk and problems.
"Before I got pregnant, I read a lot about
the pregnancies of other mothers with my
conditions. I traveled to another city to be
cared by good specialist doctors. This way, I
see other mothers in my conditions who got
pregnant, and I can ask what they did. " (P9)
Some mothers tolerated the problems,
obeyed medical advice, and tried to reduce
the risk with methods: spiritual solutions,
patience, family involvement, and flexibility.
According to their discretion, they moderated
the risk and ultimately trusted in God and
were not dissatisfied.
"I did everything I couldfor this pregnancy;
I went to the doctor, I did all the screening
tests they said, I put my trust in God, I prayed,
I read the Qur'an for her health, and thanked
God that it has progressed this far. God is
great". (P19)
Getting pregnant for some mothers, such
as heart patients or chronic diseases, was
associated with more problems than other
mothers. It was to preserve the health of the
fetus and mother. In this way, they accept
all kinds of hardships and difficulties with
all their soul. The health of the fetus was a
priority for these mothers.
"I didn't have a child; no matter what
the doctor recommended, I still refused and
became pregnant. It is important for me to
keep the child; I try to use everything I can
ijcbnm.sums.ac.ir


to reduce my stress. I cope with illness and
conditions everyway, ..........., I take medicine,
Ifollow a diet, just to give birth to a healthy
child. " (P6)
3.b. Avoidance and Inefficient Engagements
In addition to the thought of ignorance
of the risk, some mothers showed avoidance
behavior and inefficient engagements in their
actions. They consciously knew that they
should not get pregnant. They did not take any
measures to assess the risk before pregnancy.
They justified the risk of pregnancy to factors
other than medical issues or avoided going
to the doctor out of fear they did not take
preventive measures.
'If I wanted to wait for the doctors to give
me permission to get pregnant, I didn't know
how long it would take, and then they might
say: no, you shouldn 't get pregnant; that's why
I didn 't go to the doctor before I got pregnant.
Even now that I'm pregnant, when I go to the
doctor, I don't ask anything. " (P24)
Some mothers consciously resisted medical
advice (advice not to get pregnant). They put
the doctor against the fait accompli and got
pregnant. They justified that the appropriate
time to have a child with their living conditions
was now, or decided to continue childbearing,
regardless of the risk until they have desired
number of children.
'I didn't ask the doctor before; I got
pregnant. Then, I told my doctor, my baby is
already big; it was time to have another child
and I am pregnant now.... " (p4)
DISCUSSION
The main aim of this study was to explain
high-risk pregnant mothers' experiences from
risk management. The results showed that
the mother's feeling was more prominent as
the most significant element of measuring
behavior after being informed about the risks
of pregnancy. Mothers, who had a poor history
of a previous pregnancy or chronic diseases,
such as heart disease or pregnancy with several
risk factors, felt more worried and disappointed
IJCBNM January 2023; Vol 11, No 1
Risk management in high-risk pregnancy
because they felt more at risk. On the other
hand, in mothers whose risk factor was less
severe, such as age or the risk of pregnancy was
controllable from the mother's point of view, at
the same time as worry, feelings of happiness
and optimism were more expressed in the
mother. The results of another study showed
that pregnancy, along with having an unhealthy
and high-risk body in diabetic women, brought
a sense of lack of control, which led to the
feeling of worry and guilt about high blood
glucose levels, constant pressure, and difficult
interactions with health care professionals.20
In a systematic review, high-risk mothers
experienced a wide range of emotions. Their
behavior influenced expectations, social norms,
pregnancy complications, fetal abnormalities,
and pregnancy-related diseases. Therefore,
shock, fear, despair, sadness, isolation and
loneliness, anger, sadness, guilt, and mental
health disorders were commonly seen in these
mothers.21 In another study, mothers experienced
emotions such as fear, anxiety, and sadness with
happiness in a HRP.22 Another systematic review
found that the increase or decrease in maternal
happiness during pregnancy was influenced by
factors such as age, life with a sexual partner,
social support, previous pregnancy experience,
desired pregnancy, and health status.23
In the present study, mothers started self-
evaluation after the initial stages of facing
the problem and subsiding the physiological
reactions. According to the mothers'
perception of personal capabilities and risk
control, the thoughts were in the direction
of strengthening positive feelings or denying
the risk and avoiding responsibility. Thoughts
of mothers who had a feeling of peace and
hope were in the direction of reducing the
effects of the risk. Mothers who felt worried
and helpless blamed themselves and focused
on the obstacles by denying the responsibility
of managing the risk. In one study, high-risk
mothers who had a sense of self-efficacy
positively searched for information and in
stressful situations used individual approaches
such as control, avoidance, and distraction to
stressful information.24
63


Khadivzadeh T, Shojaeian Z, Sahebi A
Our results showed that the next step after
the targeted imagination to overcome the risk
was managing and practical determination of
effective and ineffective behaviors. Therefore,
the mothers' behaviors (problem-oriented
strategies versus avoidance strategies)
were included. Actions were being patient,
seeking support from relevant, trusting
in God and imams, controlling stressors
versus shirking responsibility refusing to
take preventive measures, and trying to get
pregnant without paying attention to the risk
factor. The methods or strategies a person
uses to overcome stressful situations play an
important role in his/her mental health. In a
study, difference in behavior during pregnancy
was caused by differences in cultures.25 In
another study, literacy, income, and education
were efficient on health behavior.26 Strategies
used by women with phenylketonuria in
one study included seeking knowledge and
support, learning skills, coping strategies
with evaluation, and reassuring to minimize
harm to the fetus.27 In one study, the mothers'
choices depended on perceived risk severity,
judgment and beliefs about risks of pregnancy
and childbirth, mother's weighting of various
influencing factors, and prioritizing and
balancing the risk factors. The interpretation
of safety and risk was different in mothers
who chose home birth or hospital birth, but
the goal of both groups was the health and
well-being of the fetus.24 In a review studyr,
researchers found that the behavior of mothers
during pregnancy was influenced by values,
beliefs, perceived risk, priorities, and different
capabilities, the way to collect information
and examine them. The main theme of all
mothers' behaviors during pregnancy was
maternal and fetal health. All mothers were
trying to fulfill the pregnancy in a way that
would ensure maternal and fetal health and
that care and problems during pregnancy
would not prevent them from satisfying other
personal and family needs.13
As a limitation of this study, the purposeful
sample method and enrolment of volunteered
participants might have been a selection
64
bias. Another limitation was that the care
providers did not participate in the study.
The strengths of this study are the use of a
qualitative approach and that the study is the
first to explore Iranian pregnant women's
experiences of risk management during a
HRP. We recruited the participants with
maximum variation sampling, e.g., mothers
with different risk factors throughout
pregnancy.
CONCLUSION
Risk management experiences of pregnant
women within HRPs include a wide range of
positive and negative feelings, effective and
ineffective thoughts, and behaviors ofthe mother.
Mothers who faced several risk factors or chronic
diseases during pregnancy felt helpless, focused
on the obstacles to having a healthy child, and
avoided responsibility and effective behaviors.
On the other hand, tirelessness and efforts to use
all possible solutions and risk management to
achieve the goals were the characteristics of the
mothers who, with positive thinking and belief
in the ability to manage risk and using available
resources, tried to bring their pregnancy to
fruition despite the risk. The pregnant mothers'
desire to choose the best approach for both the
child's health and their well-being is based
on their assessment of the pregnancy risks.
Mutual collaboration between mothers and
midwives/obstetricians can lead to choosing
effective risk management strategies. Further
studies on midwives and obstetricians about risk
management in pregnancy are recommended.

Abstract
Background: Computerized clinical decision support (CDSS) —digital information systems designed to improve
clinical decision making by providers - is a promising tool for improving quality of care This study aims to
understand the uptake of ASMAN application (defined as completeness of electronic case sheets), the role of CDSS
in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery outcomes.
Methods: We have conducted secondary analysis of program data (government data) collected from 81 public
facilities across four districts each in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The data collected between
August —October 2017 (baseline) and the data collected between December 2019 — March 2020 (latest) was
analysed. The data sources included: digitized labour room registers, case sheets, referral and discharge summary
forms, observation checklist and complication format. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate and interrupted time
series regression analyses were conducted.
Results: The completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period (40.5%), and in facilities with
more than 300 deliveries a month (20 9%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the introduction of technology
yielded significant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices. We have observed reduction in fresh still
births rates and asphyxia, but these results were not statistically significant in interrupted time series analysis.
However, our analysis showed that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of
program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased.
Conclusions: Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care and delivery
outcome. Future studies with rigorous study design is required to understand the impact of technology in
improving quality of maternity care.

Usmanova et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Introduction
Globally, it has been proven that effective and quality of
care at the facility level, particularly around childbirth
and immediately after the birth, can significantly con-
tribute to the reduction of maternal deaths, stillbirths
and neonatal deaths [1, 2]. Over the last decades, efforts
in ensuring skilled birth attendance resulted in increased
institutional deliveries, this in turn moved higher pro-
portion of avoidable maternal and neonatal mortality to
health facilities [2]. Therefore, improving quality of care
around childbirth and immediately after birth is impera-
tive to prevent adverse outcomes for pregnant women
and new-borns [2].
In India, despite a tremendous increase in rate of insti-
tutional deliveries [3], maternal and neonatal deaths did
not show equivalent reduction [4] in the last decade. It
was found by few studies that the increase in the rate of
institutional deliveries was not matched with overall im-
provement in quality of maternity care [4—6]. Quality of
care is a multi-dimensional concept that incudes avail-
ability of evidence based guidelines, strengthened infra-
structure, resources, enabling environment, attitude of
health providers; all these in turn result in patients' and
providers' satisfaction and improved health outcomes
[2]. To address these issues the, Government of India
(Gol), launched the quality improvement initiative under
the name 'Dakshata' (means adroitness) [7], to build pro-
vider adherence to key evidence based clinical practices
during intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods.
Dakshata uses the World Health Organization's Safe
Childbirth Checklist (SCC) as a framework for
improving providers' competency. Although, Dakshata
intervention has not been evaluated, other quality of
intrapartum care improvement initiatives using SCC in
Rajasthan [8], Uttar Pradesh [9] and Karnataka [10]
demonstrated significant improvement in adherence to
evidence based clinical practices. Moreover, a study from
Rajasthan showed reduction in perinatal mortality,
which fell by 11% [11]. However, these studies detected
certain clinical practices that either did not improve sig-
nificantly (initiation of partograph, counselling on dan-
ger signs), or declined over 12 months' period (use of
SCC, administration of oxytocin soon after delivery).
Thus, it is imperative to identify and test innovative so-
lutions for improving quality of care in order to acceler-
ate reduction in maternal and neonatal death in India.
One such solution is computerized clinical decision sup-
port (CDSS) —digital information systems designed to
improve clinical decision making by providers — a prom-
ising tool for improving quality of care by improving ad-
herence to clinical guidelines [12, 13], practitioner's
performance [12, 14], patient outcomes [15—17], and
quality of clinical documentation [18], thus contributing
to quality improvement and overall efficiency of health

care delivery. While there is significant research on
CDSSs generally, but evidence of use of CDSS for mater-
nity care is limited. In rural health facilities in Burkina
Faso, Ghana and Tanzania, CDSS was not found to sig-
nificantly improve quality of antenatal and delivery care
[19]. A study conducted in South Africa showed that
CDSS lead to overall improvement in adherence to clin-
ical guidelines, but it was not statistically significant [20].
In Nigeria, McNabb et al., reported that decision support
via mobile phones led to significant improvement in
health counselling, technical services, quality of health
education and patient satisfaction [21].
ASMAN intervention
In this paper we describe the findings from implementa-
tion of "ASMAN" (The Alliance for Saving Mothers and
Newborns) a provider-focused package of interventions
that leverages technology to reduce maternal and early
neonatal mortality through the adoption of key tech-
nologies that improve capacity-building and service de-
livery efforts focused on the provision of quality care
during childbirth and the first 48—60 h after delivery.
The ASMAN project takes an integrated quality im-
provement approach:
1.
2.
Competency building — through provision of
training for Medical Officers (MOs), Staff Nurses,
Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) on clinical skills
and quality of care as per the established labour
room protocols and standards. For this purpose, the
project adopted Gol approved Dakshata training
package for building the capacity of service
providers. Post training follow up and on-site men-
toring were conducted by the program team to en-
sure translation of skills into practice.
Introduction of technology intervention to facilitate
timely and correct clinical decision-making by pro-
viders. For this purpose, ASMAN, an android based
application for electronic recording of intrapartum
and immediate postpartum care, integrated with
Clinical Decision Support, e-partograph, knowledge
enhancement and other features was introduced at
project sites. The ASMAN application runs on a
tablet stationed in several important areas of the
health facilities, including registration, triage, the
labor room, postpartum areas, operation theatre
and post-operative wards.
The ASMAN application had the following
components:
• Case management: Digitized case sheet from
admission until discharge with integrated clinical
rules (admission notes, e-partogram, Safe Childbirth


Usmanova et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Checklist, delivery notes, post-delivery monitoring,
post-natal care, discharge slip, referral slip, events
section, alerts & notifications).
• Dashboards and reports: System generated
dashboards and reports for respective health facility,
district and state level managers.
E-learning content: All GOI training modules,
guidelines and tutorials. Available in audio, video, or
readable format in English or in Hindi
ASMAN Complication Management Game: a case-
based game designed to improve management of
intrapartum and immediate postpartum/ postnatal
complications for developing critical thinking skills
of health workers around safe child delivery
• Safe Delivery App: which provides evidence-based
clinical guidelines on Basic Emergency Obstetric and
Neonatal Care
• Remote support center: staffed 24/7 by senior
residents at the medical college for provision of
support in cases of unclear management. Staff at the
remote support center have access to all cases
ASMAN program implementation took place across
81 public facilities in four districts each in Rajasthan and
Madhya Pradesh states of India. The key stakeholders of
ASMAN were Governments of Madhya Pradesh and
Rajasthan. This project was piloted between June 2017
to May 2020, with support from Reliance Foundation,
Tata Trusts, MSD for Mothers, Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation and United States Agency for International
Development (USAID). Jhpiego was the lead implemen-
tation agency. The respective state governments were
consulted to select specific intervention districts that
had higher neonatal and maternal mortality rates as
compared to the state average, districts without ongoing
intervention for improving quality of intrapartum and
postpartum care. Within those districts, government
health facilities that had a relatively high case load of 50
or more deliveries per month and therefore, greater need
for intervention, were selected.
This program implementation offered an opportunity
to evaluate the role of a CDSS in improving quality of
care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum
periods, assess its impact on delivery outcomes, identifi-
cation and referral of key maternal and neonatal compli-
cations in selected public facilities.
Methodology
Research aims
To our knowledge, no studies from India have described
the impact of CDSS on clinical outcomes during the
intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods. Along
with the lack of evidence on effect of CDSS in improving
quality of maternity care, this gap represents a crucial
Page 3 of 12
research priority for India with global relevance.
Through this analysis, we attempt to answer the follow-
ing questions:
1.
2.
3.
4.
What was the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers?
How did the ASMAN application affect adherence
to key clinical practices?
What was the trend of maternal (pre-eclampsia,
eclampsia, postpartum haemorrhage) and neonatal
(fresh still births, birth asphyxia) complications
during the project implementation?
What was the trend of identification and referral of
maternal complications (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia,
postpartum haemorrhage) during the project
implementation?
Study design, and study setting
We have conducted secondary analysis of program data
(government data) collected from 81 public facilities
across four districts each in two states of Madhya
Pradesh (Jabalpur, Khargone, Ratlam and Vidisha) and
Rajasthan (Ajmer, Bhilwara, Kota and Jhalawar). This
de-identified dataset was provided by the government of
both states. The data collected between August —Octo-
ber 2017 was considered as a baseline and the data
collected between December 2019 — March 2020 was
considered as a latest assessment. The study was per-
formed in accordance with ethical principles outlined in
the World Medical Association (W MA) Declaration of
Helsinki [22] where privacy and confidentiality of per-
sonal information was assured by getting access to de-
identified data.
Study tools and data collection
The following tools were used to collect data:
• ASMAN application data- has digitized all labour
room registers, case sheets, referral and discharge
summary forms of Government of India. Every
woman who comes to any ASMAN facility for
delivery is registered in the application. All forms
are filled by the health providers at the 81 project
facilities in real time. Details from patient history,
labour room case sheets, partograph, until
discharge is collected in the ASMAN application.
We have used data from ASMAN application to
understand filling ratio at admission, delivery,
post-delivery, postnatal care (PNC) and discharge.
Data of all those women who had delivered at
ASMAN facilities and their newborns between
November 2017 and March 2020 in Rajasthan
and Madhya Pradesh states are used for this ana-
lysis. Till March 2020, data of 266,992 women


Usmanova et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
who delivered and 228,807 newborns were en-
tered in ASMAN application.
• The observation checklist was developed based on
WHO SCC [23] and was approved by GOI as part of
monitoring activities under Dakshata program [24].
This checklist was designed to measure adherence
to essential practices around childbirth. These
practices were divided by pause points: practices
that are necessary to perform on admission, just
before pushing (or before caesarean), soon after
birth (1 h) and before discharge. This tool was used
to explore adherence to practices at the baseline and
latest assessment periods. The program officers,
with medical background, collected this information;
the observation assessment on average took 2—4 h.
• Complication format: Maternal and New Born
Complications Identification and Referral
Monitoring System. Since, there is no formal
mechanism in the government systems to monitor
childbirth and new born related complication and
management, complication format was introduced
by ASMAN program team with the support from
the Governments of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
The complication reporting format captured data on
key maternal and newborn health indicators from
the labour room, postpartum ward, Sick Newborn
Care Unit (SNCU), admissions and discharge
department of the facility. This format captured data
on total deliveries, type of deliveries, fresh stillbirths,
preterm births, maternal and neonatal death,
maternal complications (pre-eclampsia, eclampsia,
sepsis, postpartum haemorrhage, sepsis), neonatal
complications (neonatal asphyxia and sepsis), refer
in and refer out data for maternal and neonatal
complications. One nodal person, preferably a
labour room staff, was selected from each
intervention facility to act as the key contact person
for this initiative and was validated regularly by
ASMAN program team. This tool was used to
explore effect of ASMAN application on delivery
outcomes.
Data analysis
To describe uptake of ASMAN application, we com-
puted the filling rates of 75 key data fields of the applica-
tion and analysed the differences by pause points, level
of health facility and average annual delivery load at the
health facilities.
To analyze the change in adherence to evidence based
practices after roll out of the intervention, we combined
the baseline assessment and last periodic assessment
data sets. For overall univariate analysis of adherence to
key clinical practices before and after comparison, we
computed means for before and latest intervention
Page 4 of 12
periods and compared them using chi square test. For
adherence to evidence based practices, we also per-
formed multivariable logistic regression analysis for each
practice while adjusting for level of facility, average de-
livery load at the facility and availability of resources re-
quired for each key practice.
To analyze trends in maternal and neonatal complica-
tions, and referrals we utilized the monthly complication
format data which was shared by all ASMAN interven-
tion facilities. As the intervention was rolled out in a
staggered manner at different time points across project
health facilities, we categorized the complication data of
each facility into two time periods corresponding to be-
fore and after intervention roll out.
Within each time period, we further grouped monthly
data into quarterly data (3 months' data), such that each
quarter represented a time interval relative to the inter-
vention roll out. For example, Q-1 and Q + 1 denoted
the periods corresponding to 3 months before and 3
months after intervention rollout respectively. The
month of intervention roll out together with subsequent
2 months were denoted as QO or quarter O or the time
interval corresponding to intervention roll out. Data of
corresponding quarters was combined for all facilities
and this dataset was used for generating simple time
series plots (line/bar) for analysing the trends before and
after intervention roll out.
Single group interrupted time series regression analysis
was performed on two dependent variables 1) fresh still
birth rate and 2) incidence of neonatal asphyxia. We
have conducted interrupted time series analysis for these
two outcomes as these were primary outcomes of the
intervention. Monthly data was utilized for carrying out
this analysis, yielding data for 12 time points before and
after intervention roll out respectively (M — 12 to M-1
before roll out and M + 1 to M + 12 after roll out). Coef-
ficients or parameters which represented a shift in the
level (intercept) of the dependent variable and a shift in
the rate of change (slope) of dependent variable, after
intervention, were computed along with 95% confidence
intervals. Newey west standard errors were utilized to
account for autocorrelation.
For all statistical tests of significance, p value < 0.05
was considered significant. We used Statistics package
for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 24, Stata version
14 and Microsoft Excel, for data analysis.
Results
Characteristics of facilities
Sixty-three percent of 81 intervention facilities were
community health centres. More than half of interven-
tion facilities had average monthly delivery load less than
100 (Table 1).

The analysis of filling ratio of ASMAN application re-
vealed that filling ratio was lowest at the PNC period
(40.5%), followed by admission (80.2%), discharge
(82.9%), post-delivery (93.1%) and delivery (93.7%)
(Table 3). Further, it was also found that filling ratio was
low in high delivery load facilities compare to low and
medium delivery load facilities (Table 2). However, fill-
ing ratio was not statistically significant by facility type
and by delivery load.
Adherence to key clinical practices
Table 3 illustrates providers' adherence to key clinical
practices across all pause points at the baseline and lat-
est assessment. In univariate analysis, statistically signifi
cant improvement in adherence to key clinical practices
was observed in 18 of 20 key clinical practices.
Page 5 of 12
Measuring birth weight and breastfeeding initiation were
the only practices that did not show statistically signifi
cant change in univariate analysis; both of these
practices were above 70% at the time of baseline assess-
ment. However, after adjusting for level of facility, aver-
age annual delivery load and resource availability all
clinical practices showed significant improvement (Table
3).
Delivery outcomes
Figure 1 depicts the trend of fresh still birth rates in
intervention facilities through the study period. There
was a steady decline through the period and the differ-
ence between mean still birth rate of four quarters
before intervention roll out and four quarters after inter-
vention roll out, was statistically significant (p < 0.05).
The interrupted time series regression analysis on
monthly data revealed that there was a decrease in fresh
still birth rate after intervention roll out [— 0.92 (95%
confidence interval: — 3.00 — 1.1.4)], though this change
was not statistically significant. The trend over time did
not change significantly either [0.12 (95% confidence
interval: — 0.13 — 0.38)] (supplementary file 1).
Figure 2 depicts the trend of neonatal asphyxia cases
(per 1000 live births) in intervention facilities through
the study period. There is a clear decline observed in
number of cases after ASMAN application roll out. The
difference between the mean number of cases in time
periods before and after application rollout, found to be
statistically significant (p < 0.05).
The interrupted time series regression analysis on
monthly data revealed that there was a decrease in num-
ber of neonatal asphyxia cases after intervention roll out
[— 3.12 (95% confidence interval: — 9.73 — 3.47)], though

this change was not statistically significant. The rate of
decline (slope) increased [— 0.36 (95% confidence inter-
val: — 1.09 — 0.36)], though this too was not statistically
significant (Additional file 1).
Maternal complications
Figure 3 illustrates the trend of pre —eclampsia /eclamp-
sia cases and refer out in intervention sites before and
after ASMAN application rollout. There is an increase in
identification of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia cases after
application roll-out, while referral out declined over the
same time period.
Analysis of postpartum haemorrhage cases and refer
out trends in intervention sites before and after ASMAN
application rollout revealed an increase in identification
of postpartum haemorrhage cases and decrease in refer-
ral out (Fig. 4).
Discussion
Our study described the uptake of ASMAN application
among health care providers, the role of ASMAN appli-
cation in improving adherence to key clinical practices,
delivery outcomes and maternal complications. We have
observed that, introducing ASMAN application resulted
in statistically significant improvements in adherence to
key clinical practices. However, overall completeness of
case sheets in ASMAN application was low across all
levels of facilities. We have observed reduction in fresh

On the other hand, our analysis showed that identifica-
tion of maternal complications has increased over the
period of program implementation and at the same time
referral outs decreased.
Uptake of ASMAN application
We have included completeness of case sheets in appli-
cation as a measure of data quality as it is a commonly
assessed dimension of data quality mentioned in a re-
view [25]. Although, using medical records has been
criticized for measuring quality of record keeping prac-
tices instead of quality of care, it was argued that patient
case records should be part of quality of care assessment;
because individual case records are essential not only for
case management and peer review but also for assessing
the impact of health interventions [26]. Additionally, it
was noted that clinical record keeping enables continuity
of care and improves communication between different
health providers [27].

Our results indicated that the filling ratio during the
post-partum period was low across all type of facilities.
The poor clinical documentation was reported in a re-
view of obstetric records conducted in India [28], with
the extent of documentation varying between 1.3% (as-
sessment of mother's condition at the discharge) and
99.1% (admission date). Similarly, a multicenter retro-
spective review of clinical records of cesarean delivery in
five low-income countries identified poor-quality record
keeping with missing information on key events, man-
agement of complications, and delivery outcomes [29].
Furthermore, we have found that the filling ratio across
all pause points was low at the district hospital level and
high delivery load facilities. In our qualitative study [30],
health care providers mentioned that staff shortage, pa-
tient urgency, high caseloads prevented staff to complete
all fields in the application. According to a study
conducted by Chaturvedi [28] and colleagues, Madhya
Pradesh state of India, documentation was better at dis-
trict hospitals due to higher qualification of the staff in
those facilities and availability of forms at the district
hospitals. Although, the present study did not conduct

comparison of documentation before and after ASMAN
application roll out, due to the unavailability of data be-
fore application rollout, respondents in our qualitative
study [30] reported that ASMAN application improved
documentation. Additionally, a study conducted in Aus-
tralian tertiary maternity facility [31] found that the use
of electronic health records resulted in significant im-
provements in completeness of data captured. Further-
more, it was noted by the same study that the data
captured electronically was easily available to providers
compare to paper based records. Understanding the rea-
sons for the low filling ratios at the PNC period would
require further research. The low filling ratio at facilities
with delivery load more than 300 could be explained by
bigger client -provider ratio could be reasons as per an-
ecdotal experience.
Adherence to key clinical practices
Our study revealed that quality of care across all pause
points improved during the implementation of ASMAN
application. Furthermore, labor room staff in the
1.8
qualitative study mentioned that ASMAN application
improved their ability to take a complete history and
physical exam, identify high-risk patients, manage cases
confidently, facilitate provider communication, improve
reporting processes, and ensure continuity of care for re-
ferral patients [30]. In our study we have observed that
examinations around identification and management of
complications, initiation of partograph, identification of
post-partum haemorrhage increased significantly. These
results indicate that ASMAN application has the poten-
tial to improve quality of care provided around the
childbirth. These are very encouraging results, as timely
identification of complications is crucial because over a
third of maternal deaths, a significant proportion of
pregnancy-related life-threatening conditions; approxi-
mately half of all stillbirths and a quarter of neonatal
deaths are attributed to complications that occur during
labour, childbirth or the immediate postpartum period
[32—34]. Our findings are in line with the results of three
systematic reviews on the role of CDSS use on providers'
adherence to clinical practices [12—14]. According to

Garg and colleagues [12], better performance of pro-
viders was observed in studies where users were auto-
matically prompted to use the systems compared with
studies in which users were required to actively initi-
ate the system. Additionally, the same review ob-
served better performance in studies in which the
trial authors also developed the CDSS software [12].
Moreover, a synthesis of high quality systematic re-
views [14] showed that the positive effect of CDSS
depends on the services which it was used; CDSS
positively impacted providers' performance in studies
on drugs ordering and preventive care measures.
Kawamoto et al., [13] identified four features strongly
associated with a decision support system's ability to
improve clinical practice—(a) decision support pro-
vided automatically as part of clinician workflow, (b)
decision support delivered at the time and location of
decision making, (c) actionable recommendations pro-
vided, and (d) computer based. Additionally, CDSS
should also provide periodic performance feedback,
request documentation of the reason for not following
system recommendations, and share decision support
results with patients.
While there are studies on benefits of CDSS in general,
there is very limited research on benefits of CDCC in
maternity care. Duysburgh et al., [19] did not find a sig-
nificant improvement in quality of antenatal and delivery
care with the use of CDSS assessed in Burkina Faso,
Ghana and Tanzania. They have concluded that, history
taking, counselling, health education, laboratory investi-
gations, and examination and monitoring of mothers
and newborns during childbirth were not performed ac-
cording to the standards. A study conducted in South
Africa for improving compliance of health care workers
with antenatal care guidelines found overall improve-
ment, but it was not statistically significant [20].
McNabb et al., reports significant improvement in health
counselling, technical services, quality of health educa-
tion and patient satisfaction as a result of a mobile
phone decision support during antenatal care in Nigeria
[21].
Furthermore, studies conducted in India on the role of
CDSS in the management of cardiovascular diseases [35]
and hypertension [36] demonstrated positive role of
CDSS in improving care, adherence to guidelines, coun-
selling and follow up with patients that resulted in blood
pressure reduction.
Delivery outcomes and maternal complications
Improved practices around childbirth have a potential to
prevent birth asphyxia and complications due to prema-
turity, which are some of the main causes of fresh still
births and early neonatal deaths [34, 34, 37]. Our results
revealed that there was a significant decrease in fresh
Page 9 of 12
still birth and asphyxia, however this decrease wasn't sta-
tistically significant in interrupted time series analysis.
These results are in line with the global evidence on the
lack of evidence of potential impact of CDSS on patient
outcomes [12—14, 37, 38]. Thus, according to the sys-
tematic review, majority of the studies assessed patient
outcomes often without adequate statistical power to de-
tect clinically important differences [12]. Jaspers and col-
leagues found only few studies on impact of CDSS on
patient outcomes, though many of these have been too
small in sample size or too short in time to reveal clinic-
ally important effect [14]. Furthermore, a systematic re-
view and meta-analysis found that CDSS linked to
electronic health records did not detect statistically sig-
nificant reduction in morbidity and mortality [38].
The lack of statistically significant improvement in de-
livery outcomes could be attributed to the small sample
size and short follow-up periods which is not long
enough to assess the impact of CDSS on patient out-
comes [14].
During the course of the program implementation,
we have observed that identification of pre-eclampsia
is increased while referrals for the same conditions
decreased. This change could be attributed to the
improved assessment at the time of admission.
Moreover, we have observed the same trend in iden-
tification and referral of postpartum hemorrhage that
could be explained by increased administration of
oxytocin within 1 min of delivery.
Strengths and limitations
The results of our study contributes to the dearth of lit-
erature on the role of CDSS in maternity care. From the
onset of the program our team trained and worked
closely with the focal point in each facility to ensure
quality of data and timely reporting. Furthermore, as a
part of program implementation, all providers were
trained in distinguishing and reporting fresh still births.
Additionally, data reported from facilities were regularly
validated by our team. The availability of data before
and during the program implementation allowed us to
estimate the role of CDSS in improving quality of intra-
partum care and delivery outcomes. Our study has few
limitations. Firstly, it is possible that providers carried
out the patient management according to the standards
but didn't record it in application. Secondly, our assess-
ment involved direct observation of provider practices,
as a result potential Hawthorne effect would have hap-
pened. To minimize Hawthorne effect we trained our
project officers using standard observation checklist and
standard operating procedures. Lastly, due to utilization
of program data in our analysis, establishing causal claim
is limited.


Usmanova et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that provides
and evidence on the role of technology to improve the
quality of intrapartum care and delivery outcomes in
India. However, the results of this study could be gener-
alized to another country with similar settings. Our
study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality
of intrapartum care and delivery outcome. Future studies
with rigorous study design are required to understand
the impact of technology in improving quality of mater-
nity care. These studies could provide evidence on redu-
cing the burden of maternal and neonatal death
attributable to inadequate quality of care in India and
globally.

Associations between pre-pregnancy psychosocial risk
factors and infant outcomes: a population-based cohort
study in England
Katie Harron, Ruth Gilbert, Jamie Fagg, Astrid Guttmann, Jan van der Meulen
Summary
Background Existing studies evaluating the association between maternal risk factors and specific infant outcomes such
as birthweight, injury admissions, and mortality have mostly focused on single risk factors. We aimed to identify
routinely recorded psychosocial characteristics of pregnant women most at risk of adverse infant outcomes to inform
targeting of early intervention.
Methods We created a cohort using administrative hospital data (Hospital Episode Statistics) for all births to mothers
aged 15—44 years in England, UK, who gave birth on or after April 1, 2010, and who were discharged before or on
March 31, 2015. We used generalised linear models to evaluate associations between psychosocial risk factors recorded
in hospital records in the 2 years before the 20th week of pregnancy (ie, teenage motherhood, deprivation, pre-
pregnancy hospital admissions for mental health or behavioural conditions, and pre-pregnancy hospital admissions
for adversity, including drug or alcohol abuse, violence, and self-harm) and infant outcomes (ie, birthweight,
unplanned admission for injury, or death from any cause, within 12 months from postnatal discharge).
Findings Of 2 520 501 births initially assessed, 2137103 were eligible and were included in the birth outcome analysis.
Among the eligible births, 93 279 (4 • 4%) were births to teenage mothers (age years), 168186 (7 • 9%) were births to
previous teenage mothers, 51312 (2 • 4%) were births to mothers who had a history of hospital admissions for mental
health or behavioural conditions, 58107 (2 • 7%) were births to mothers who had a history of hospital admissions for
adversity, and 580 631 (27 • 2%) were births to mothers living in areas of high deprivation. 1377 706 (64 • 5%) of births
were to mothers with none of the above risk factors. Infants born to mothers with any of these risk factors had poorer
outcomes than those born to mothers without these risk factors. Those born to mothers with a history of mental health
or behavioural conditions were 124 g lighter (95% CI 114—134 g) than those born to mothers without these conditions.
For teenage mothers compared with older mothers, 3 •6% (95% CI 3 • •9%) more infants had an unplanned
admission for injury, and there were 10 • 2 (95% CI 7 • 5—12 • 9) more deaths per 10 000 infants.
Interpretation Health-care services should respond proactively to pre-pregnancy psychosocial risk factors. Our study
demonstrates a need for effective interventions before, during, and after pregnancy to reduce the downstream burden
on health services and prevent long-term adverse effects for children.

Introduction
Psychosocial factors in pregnant women that are not
addressed can have adverse effects on outcomes of preg-
nancy for both mothers and their infants.l Guidelines
from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
recommend that women with "complex social risk factors"
should be identified during pregnancy so that additional
support can be provided.2 These guidelines recognise
that vulnerable women often experience a range of
social risk factors simultaneously, and highlight the
specific needs of teenage mothers (aged <20 years) , women
who misuse substances, and women who experience
domestic violence.
Targeted support for women before and during preg-
nancy has the potential to improve outcomes at and after
birth, through promoting preconception health and

reproductive choices and mitigating the adverse effects of
maternal stress.3-5 Postnatal support can positively affect
the quality of caregiving and child attachment, and the
development and behaviour of the child; furthermore, it
can mitigate the effects of adversity and reduce the risk of
unmet medical need or child injury.6 Appropriate early
intervention can therefore lead to improved maternal and
neonatal outcomes, and health, education, and social
outcomes throughout childhood.7
In England, maternity services and primary care
during and after pregnancy are universal and freely
available for the approximately 700 000 births per year,
with home visiting support delivered through the
Healthy Child Programme.g The frequency of home
visits and contact varies according to a proportionate
universalism model, meaning that whereas support is

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for studies published in English between
Jan 1, 2000, and May 1, 2020, using the MeSH terms
"pregnancy outcome", birthweight", "infant mortality", OR
"infant, newborn", AND "maternal age", "adolescence", "parity",
"social class", "substance-related disorders" "violence", OR
"mental disorders". We reviewed studies from high-income
countries that addressed maternal risk factors before and
during pregnancy in relation to birth outcomes, or infant
hospital admissions or mortality. Previous cohort and
administrative data longitudinal studies have examined the
association between young maternal age and parity and
specific maternal or infant health outcomes, and they have
found that young maternal age is associated with low
birthweight, preterm birth, and increased health-care use
throughout childhood. Population-based cohorts also report
links between poor maternal mental health during pregnancy
and low birthweight or preterm birth, and between poor
maternal mental health during pregnancy and injury and
respiratory symptoms in children. Other studies have found
increased risks of infant morbidity and mortality or poor child
development associated with risky behaviours of the mother
recorded during pregnancy (including smoking, drug or alcohol
misuse, or poor diet), mother exposure to intimate partner
violence, maternal mental health, or lack of antenatal care.
Many studies have also highlighted disparities for those with
lower versus higher social status, and differences in risk of
adverse infant and child health outcomes by ethnicity, race, or
Aboriginal status. Most studies focused on single risk factors;
we did not find any studies using population-based
administrative data to quantify the association of multiple
psychosocial risk factors that are routinely recorded by health
services before or during pregnancy, and infant birthweight,
injury admissions, and mortality.
Added value of this study
This population-based cohort study examined data from more
than 2 million mother-baby pairs in National Health Service
hospitals in England, UK, over 5 years. This study showed that
pre-pregnancy psychosocial risk factors routinely recorded in
universal, scale and intensity is proportionate to the level
of need and disadvantage.g•9 In practice, groups who
stand to benefit from additional support (ie, for whom
early intervention might be effective) are identified as
those likely to experience adverse health outcomes.
Previous evidence has identified associations between
poor birth and infant outcomes and risk factors that
are routinely recorded in hospital records such as
young maternal age, parity, risky behaviours (including
smoking, drug or alcohol misuse, or poor diet), exposure
to intimate partner violence, maternal mental health,
and poor engagement with antenatal care services.

98
hospitalisation records before 20 weeks of pregnancy
(ie, previous birth before 20 years of age, hospital contacts
related to adversity or mental health or behavioural conditions,
and deprivation) were associated with substantially increased
risks of low birthweight, preterm birth, injury, and death during
the 12 months from postnatal discharge. Maternal age of less
than 20 years for the current or previous birth was an important
risk factor, but hospitalisations before pregnancy for drug or
alcohol abuse, self-harm, or violence, or for mental health or
behavioural conditions were also important, irrespective of
maternal age. These groups could potentially benefit from
health and social interventions before and during pregnancy.
Implications of all the available evidence
This research shows a need for effective interventions before,
during, and after pregnancy to reduce the downstream burden
on health services and prevent long-term adverse effects for
children, including low birthweight, unplanned admission for
injury, and mortality. In addition to the 11.3% of mothers who
were teenagers at the current or a previous birth, we found that
the 4% of women aged 20-44 years who could be routinely
identified from hospital data before pregnancy as having a
history of admission to hospital for adversity or mental health or
behavioural conditions also had poor birth and infant outcomes,
as did those living in the most deprived population quintile.
Improved data collection, sharing, and linkage across multiple
data sources, and efforts across primary and secondary care to
respond to psychosocial risk factors in women using health care
(especially among maternity and health visiting services)
could improve support for women before, during, and after
pregnancy, and potentially reduce adverse outcomes.
More research is needed to develop effective interventions for
women with different risk factors. Given the disparities in
outcomes across quintiles of deprivation (ie, poorer outcomes
for the 270/0 of births to women living in the most deprived
areas), strategies to address the root causes of social
disadvantage are also required. Our findings apply to England,
but could be generalisable to other countries with similar
maternal risk factors.
11'17-19 However, most previous studies focused
outcomes.
on single risk factors, and there is a gap in the evidence
on which of these risk factors—when considered
together—are associated with the highest risk. There is
an absence of studies using routine records to explore
multiple psychosocial risk factors across maternal age
groups, before and during early pregnancy.
Understanding which women are most vulnerable, and
how to identify them in time for intervention, is the first
step to the effective development and targeting of early
health and social support programmes.20 This study used
population-based hospital data to evaluate the association
between multiple maternal psychosocial risk factors

(teenage motherhood, a history of hospital admissions
for adversity or mental health conditions, or deprivation)
and key birth and infant outcomes (birthweight, un-
planned hospital admissions, and mortality) that might
be amenable to intervention. Our aim is to inform
clinical and political decision making on early targeting
of health and social support before, during, and after
pregnancy.
Methods
Study design and participants
This study is a population-based cohort study in England.
Hospital records were obtained from Hospital Episode
Statistics (HES), an administrative database holding
detailed information for all admissions to the National
Health Service hospitals in England.21 Admission records
allow the entry of up to 20 fields of clinical diagnoses
coded using the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision
(ICD-IO).
The study population consisted of a cohort of mother—
baby pairs, which was created by probabilistic linkage of
deliveries and livebirths within HES.22 We included
mother—baby pairs when births were singleton births,
mothers were aged 15—44 years at delivery, delivery
occurred on or after April 1, 2010, and discharge
happened before and on March 31, 2015. We excluded the
small number of births to mothers aged 45 years and
older, because adverse outcomes for this group might
relate to biological age (rather than the social risk factors)
and these age-related risk factors are less likely to be
amenable to intervention. We excluded births to mothers
younger than 15 years because of the small numbers. For
mothers with multiple deliveries during the study period,
we used a random number generator to select one
mother—baby pair for inclusion in analyses, to avoid
clustering of outcomes within mothers. We did not
restrict analyses to the first child, so that we could
consider parity, and so that our findings would be more
widely generalisable. Approvals for the use of HES data
were obtained as part of the standard Hospital Episode
Statistics approval process and ethical approval was
obtained from London—South East Research Ethics
Committee (reference 16/LO/0012). HES records were
made available by NHS Digital.
Outcomes
We chose outcomes that might be amenable to support
for women before, during, or after pregnancy and that
align with the priorities of English National Health
Service antenatal care and the Healthy Child Pro-
gramme.823 First, we described birthweight, because
low birthweight is a predictor of substantial morbidity.
Birthweight was modelled as a continuous variable, and
babies born weighing less than 2500 g were categorised
as having low birthweight. We also described gestational
age (based on best estimates from menstrual dates or
www.thelancet.com/public-health V016 February 2021
Articles
ultrasound) and size for gestation at birth. These
variables were derived from maternity fields in infant or
mother HES records.22 We then evaluated the number of
infants with one or more unplanned hospital admissions
for injury within 12 months from postnatal discharge.
Reducing hospital admissions and accidents is a high
impact area of the Healthy Child Programme, and
th come is considered to be amenable to change
through postnatal support delivered by health visitors.24
Admissions were defined as unplanned on the basis of
the method of admission code (ie, excluding elective
admissions), and comprised episodes of care in any
hospital captured within the HES data, starting more
than 2 days after the end of the birth episode. We used
published lists of ICD-IO diagnosis codes to identify
admissions for injury (appendix pp Finally, we see Online for appendix
measured infant mortality in the 12 months following
postnatal discharge (referred to as post-discharge
mortality). We evaluated these infant outcomes from
postnatal discharge, rather than birth, to reflect events at
home in the care of parents and to allow for different
lengths of stay during the birth or delivery admission.
Risk factors
We pre-specified a number of psychosocial risk factors
on the basis of the guidelines for antenatal care for
women with complex social needs, namely: teenage
motherhood (ie, mothers aged 15—19 years at delivery),
previous teenage motherhood (ie, mothers aged 20 years
or older at delivery, with a previous birth when aged
15—19 years), history of adversity-related admissions
(for violence, substance misuse, or self-harm), history of
admissions for mental health or behavioural conditions
(excluding self-harm), and living in areas of high
deprivation.
To define histories of adversity or histories of mental
health or behavioural conditions, we examined hospital
admission records in the 2 years before the mothers'
20th week of pregnancy. We chose 20 weeks on the basis of
recommendations that nearly all women have their
first antenatal contact (usually a booking appointment)
before this time. Guidelines recommend that women
are examined by 10 weeks of pregnancy, but the first
examination is often later for women with risk factors;
approximately 90% of all women are seen by 20 weeks of
gestation.26 Although recording of these risk factors might
also occur after 20 weeks of pregnancy, we aimed to define
risk factors that could be identified early in pregnancy. We
used a 2-year look-back period for hospital admissions,
because this period before birth is likely to have effects on
outcomes and should be in the patient records or could be
asked about by clinicians. We also examined the number
of women identified as having a history of mental health
conditions or adversity within 1 year and within 5 years
before the 20 weeks of pregnancy. We identified previous
admissions for adversity (violence, substance misuse,
self-harm), or mental health or behavioural conditions,
99


Articles
on the basis of published lists of ICD-IO diagnosis codes
(appendix pp We chose to categorise self-harm
within the adversity category because it is a behaviour or
event (which can be a manifestation of a mental health
condition), and to align with previous literature.25
Quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation were derived
from the national distribution of the Index of Multiple
Deprivation 2004 on the basis of the postcode of residence
at delivery.2S Areas of high deprivation were defined
as those within the most deprived quintile. We also
described parity and ethnicity. Mothers were classified as
primiparous if the number of previous pregnancies
recorded on the maternity record was zero, unless we
found a previous delivery for the mother present in HES
records from 2000 onwards. Previous teenage birth
was defined according to age at first birth recorded in
HES; a small proportion of mothers might have been
misclassified if they had their first birth before 2000
(ie, >IO years before the study period), or before entering
the HES cohort (eg, immigrant mothers). Ethnic group
was derived from the maternal record.
Statistical analysis
Because this study was a population-based study, no
sample size calculation was done. We first calculated the
number of women experiencing each risk factor, and the
association between risk factors and maternal age group.
We then used generalised linear models to estimate
the association between individual year of maternal
age, psychosocial risk factors, and outcomes, using
Schoenberg B-splines for age to allow for a non-linear
effect.29 This approach is based on a set of reference
points or knots, with the number of points chosen to
balance smoothness and goodness of fit. To avoid
overfitting in such a large study cohort, we present
results from models with a minimal number of a-priori
reference points (at ages 20, 25, 30, and 35 years). Results
are presented graphically with interactions for each
maternal risk factor. These plots do not present mortality
and previous teenage birth, because of the low numbers.
For unplanned admissions for injury and post-discharge
infant mortality (but not birthweight), we excluded
mother—baby pairs in which the baby would not have
been exposed to the mother after the birth episode, ie,
those discharged to social services or not surviving to
postnatal discharge (appendix p 1).
To quantify the risk of adverse outcomes for women with
each psychosocial risk factor, we derived risk differences
from generalised linear models with a log link and relative
risks from generalised linear models with an identity link,
comparing women with each risk factor to women without
that risk factor. We derived adjusted estimates to help
understand how much of the associations were explained
by concurrent risk factors. Adjusted models for birthweight
included all psychosocial risk factors defined previously,
plus maternal age (15—19, 20—24, 25—29, 30—34, 35—44 years,
whereby the 35—44-year age group combines the two 5-year
100
groups because of the low numbers), ethnicity, and parity.
Models for unplanned admission for injury counted
infants who had died from any cause after postnatal
discharge as having the outcome (because death was a
competing risk for admission). All models used robust
standard errors to allow for clustering of women within
hospitals. On the basis of these adjusted models, we
derived population attributable fractions (PAFs), to
quantify the percentage of outcomes in the study
population attributable to each risk factor.
We used multiple imputation with chained equations
for missing values of birthweight (6 •6%), gestational
age (7 • 5%), and deprivation (O • 8%). The imputation
models included birthweight, gestational age, quintile of
deprivation, delivery by caesarean section, pregnancy or
delivery and neonatal risk factors identified from ICD-IO
codes (appendix p 6), ethnic group, parity, infant sex,
maternal age, and psychosocial risk factors (previous
teenage motherhood, history of adversity, history of
mental health or behavioural conditions); we used five
imputations. A complete case analysis was done as a
sensitivity analysis. In both analyses, unknown or
missing ethnicity was treated as a separate category.
Analyses were done in Stata 15.

Results
Of 2 520 521 mother—baby pairs initially assessed for
eligibility, 383418 were excluded (appendix p 1). The study
cohort consisted of 2137103 births occurring on or
after April 1, 2010, with infants discharged before or at
March 31, 2015 (appendix p 1). 299 526 (12 • 3%) mothers
had multiple deliveries during the study period, for each
of whom we selected one mother—baby pair for inclusion
in the analyses. The prevalence of risk factors by age group
is shown in the appendix (p 7). 759 397 (35 • 5%) mothers
had at least one risk factor (14• 3% when excluding those
whose only risk factor was living in the most deprived
areas; appendix p 7). Of the 58107 (2•7%) mothers with a
history of adversity in the 2 years before 20 weeks of
pregnancy, 49755 (85•696) had admissions for substance
misuse, 21720 (37•4%) had admissions for self-harm, and
3520 (6 • 1%) had admissions for violence.
When looking back at the 5 years preceding the
20th week of pregnancy, we observed that 88923 (4•2%)
women had a history of mental health or behavioural
conditions and 117416 (5 • 5%) had a history of adversity.
When looking at the 1 year preceding the 20 weeks
of pregnancy, this number decreased to 26 967 (1 • 3%)
for mental health or behavioural conditions and to
29049 (1 • for adversity (appendix p 8).
www.thelancet.com/public-health Vol 6 February 2021


The proportion of mothers with psychosocial risk factors
tended to decrease with maternal age (appendix p 2).
Having multiple risk factors or at least one risk factor was
most common in teenage mothers and decreased with
maternal age (appendix p 7).
Babies born to the youngest or oldest mothers had the
lowest birthweights, while the highest birthweights were
observed for babies born to mothers aged 30—37 years
(figure 1). At all maternal ages, babies born to mothers
with any of the risk factors considered here tended
to have lower birthweight compared to the average
of the study population. A history of mental health or
behavioural conditions was associated with the lowest
birthweights comparatively (figure 1). Adjusting for
multiple maternal risk factors attenuated effect sizes; eg,
adjusting for current teenage motherhood attenuated the
effect of adversity (data not shown). After adjustment,
babies born to mothers with a history of mental health or
behavioural conditions had the lowest birthweights,
corresponding to a difference of 124 g (95% CI 114—134)
compared with mothers without this risk factor (figure 2;
appendix p 9). For these mothers, the adjusted relative
risk for low birthweight was 1 •63 (95% CI 1 •56—1 •70;
appendix p 9). The highest PAF for low birthweight was
for women living in the most deprived areas: 8 •2%
(95% CI 7 • 3—9 • 1) of low birthweights were attributable to
deprivation (table 1).
The percentage of infants with an unplanned
admission for injury decreased with increasing maternal
age, and was lowest for mothers aged 35—40 years
(figure 1). The highest rates of unplanned admission
for injury were seen in infants born to teenage mothers
(table 2) and to mothers with a history of mental
health conditions, across the spectrum of maternal age
(figure 1). Despite the clustering of psychosocial risk
factors in teenage mothers, this association remained
after adjusting for other risk factors, corresponding to an
additional 3 •6% (95% CI 3 • 3—3 • 9%) of infants with
unplanned admissions compared with mothers aged
20—44 years, or a relative risk of 2 • 18 (95% CI 2 • 09—2 • 27;
figure 2, appendix p 9). The highest PAF for injury
admissions was for women living in the most deprived
areas: 5 •096 (95% CI 3 • 1—6 • 9) of unplanned admissions
for injury were attributable to deprivation (table 1).
Post-discharge mortality rates followed a U-shaped
curve, with lowest rates observed for mothers
aged 30—35 years (figure 3). Infants born to teenage
mothers had the highest mortality rates, corresponding
to an additional 10•2 deaths (95% CI 7 • 5—12 •9) per
10 000 infants compared with mothers aged 20—44 years
(appendix p 9). Those born to mothers with a history of
adversity or mental health or behavioural conditions
were also at increased risk of mortality (figure 2;
appendix p 9). The highest PAF for mortality was for

Maternal age (years)
Figure 1: Association between maternal age and birth and infant outcomes
(A) Crude (unadjusted) association between maternal age and birthweight. (B) Crude (unadjusted)
association between maternal age and percentage of infants with one or more unplanned admissions for injury in
the 12 months from postnatal discharge.
Results of the sensitivity analysis using complete case
analysis were almost identical to those from the primary
analysis using multiple imputation (appendix p 10).
Discussion
Our population-based cohort study fills an evidence
gap by examining which women should be considered at
high risk for adverse birth and infant outcomes on the
basis of multiple psychosocial risk factors recorded
routinely in hospital records during or before pregnancy.
All of the psychosocial risk factors (current or previous
teenage birth, a history of adversity or mental health or
behavioural conditions, or living in the most deprived
areas) were associated with the adverse infant outcomes
of low birthweight, unplanned admission for injury, and
post-discharge mortality. The effect of these risk factors
was consistently high across all maternal age groups.
Overall, 36% of women had at least one risk factor, and
although teenage mothers were at highest risk of poor
infant outcomes, the majority (88%) of women with at
least one risk factor were older than 20 years at delivery.
A major strength of our study is that we considered
multiple psychosocial risk factors and outcomes, using
national data linking over 2 million delivery and birth
records. Without this linkage, it would not have been
possible to evaluate how maternal exposures before
pregnancy influence infant outcomes.22 A further
strength is that outcomes were based on national policy
priorities and that effect sizes were similar to those for
other well recognised risk factors for poor infant
outcomes.2S For example, the crude risk differences in
birthweight observed in this study were similar to those
seen when comparing smoking and non-smoking
mothers (150—200 g) and relative risks were comparable

Table 1: Adjusted population attributable fractions for low birthweight and unplanned admission for injury and mortality within the 12 months from
postnatal discharge, according to psychosocial risk factors
to those identified for parental mental health and infant
injuries (1 • 3).11'11 By considering and adjusting for a range
of psychosocial risk factors within a national cohort,
our study fills a gap in evidence on which factors are
associated with the greatest population attributable risk.
Our study was limited by definitions of mental health
or behavioural conditions and adversity that were based
on hospital data: we only captured cases that were severe
enough to be recorded in a hospital admission record.
However, we included up to 20 diagnostic codes, and
so would have captured admissions related to these
conditions, even when these conditions were not the
primary cause of admission. We did not have information
on smoking or body-mass index, on the amount of
support families received (eg, number of home visits by
midwives or health visitors, participation in the Family
Nurse Partnership [FNP], teenage pregnancy units, and
housing or other services) , or on childhood developmental
outcomes. However, only up to a quarter of the 3 • 5% of
first time teenage mothers in our study would have
received FNP during this period, and any benefits of this
intervention are likely to have led to an underestimation
of the effects of psychosocial risk factors. We did not
capture stillbirths or miscarriages, which might also
have underestimated the effect of psychosocial risk
factors.30 Our study included only singleton births, and
we excluded mothers either younger than 15 years or
older than 44 years. Future research could consider other
relevant outcomes (eg, presentations to emergency
departments) and explore associations for the 12% of
births to mothers with multiple deliveries during the
study period, which were excluded in this study.
Evaluating regional variation in risk factors and outcomes
could also be informative for policy. Our findings apply
to England, but could be generalisable to other countries
with similar maternal risk factors.
Proportionate universalism—the resourcing and
delivering of services that are universal but have a scale
and intensity proportionate to the level of disadvantage—
is key to reducing health inequalities.9 For this strategy to
work effectively, susceptible groups need to be identified
early, on the basis of disease burden or determinants of
health.31 We show that routine hospital data can inform

who to target and provide an approach for quantifying the
numbers of women at high risk.20 Presentations to
hospital for emergency care for mental health or
behavioural conditions, or adversity, before 20 weeks of
pregnancy, provide important opportunities for
interventions before pregnancy, including support for
reproductive choice (eg, ensuring timely access to
contraception) and preconception health (to improve
birth outcomes).; Such presentations during and after
pregnancy should also prompt emergency care services to
involve primary care and other community services to
support the mother and child to improve child outcomes,
for example through access to mental health care or
intensive home visiting to build parenting capacity,
ensure child safety, mitigate the effects of adversity, and
help prepare for subsequent pregnancies. However,
providing a universal service remains important for
identifying women with needs not meeting thresholds for
admission. Improved data collection and completeness of
risk factor recording during antenatal visits and health
visiting contacts, and improved data sharing and linkage
(across health, social care, and education services) could
support antenatal and health visiting services in making
103


Articles
judgements for individual families and strengthen
referral pathways between community and health-care
services. Such linkage would also facilitate research on
uptake and the wider societal benefits and costs of early
interventions, and the opportunity costs of increased
targeting schemes, in terms of diverting services from the
universal model.
A further requirement for proportionate universalism
is effective interventions. Interventions and specialised
services that are offered to women vary across England.32
The FNP, which is targeted at first time teenage mothers,
is one of the only programmes specifically recommended
within the Healthy Child Programme.g However, the
FNP only targets first time teenage mothers (3 •5% of
this study population), whereas the highest risk of low
birthweight and preterm birth in our study was seen in
women with a history of mental health or behavioural
conditions or adversity (who account for 4• 0% of women
across all age groups). Health visiting as an intervention
for birth outcomes is too late: more evidence is needed
on the propensity for these women to benefit from
interventions before and during pregnancy, including
whether different models of care are needed for younger
versus older women with psychosocial risk factors.33
Our study provides evidence to support health services
planning, and evidence to support decisions about
whether and how scarce universal public health services
should be targeted, in the context of decreasing funding
for public health services and the workforce (including
health visiting).35 In terms of population attributable risk,
deprivation was a key factor, followed by teenage
pregnancy (11 • 3% of women were current or previous
teenage mothers). Similar to previous studies, these
effects were not fully explained by adjusting for other
risk factors.17 Our findings indicate that primary
prevention strategies could be targeted at the population
level, on the basis of age and socioeconomic background.
Such strategies need to integrate cross-sectoral agencies;
this integration has for example been done by the
multifaceted policy intervention to reduce teenage
pregnancies in England (the Teenage Pregnancy
Strategy), which involved health and education agencies
and both contributed to a decline in teenage births and
attenuated the steep deprivation gradient.13 Previous
research has also shown that the effects of teenage
motherhood persist for previous teenage mothers giving
birth again in their 20s, meaning that strategies to
improve reproductive choices for young women about
the timing of their pregnancies could have lasting
effects.36 There is a need to understand how existing
services (eg, for teenage pregnancies, contraception,
sexual health services, and drug and alcohol services) can
best be integrated with support in early years to address
the needs of women affected by psychosocial risk factors.
Our results also support previous evidence showing
that having a history of admissions for mental health or
behavioural conditions or adversity is an important
104
potential risk indicator for poor infant outcomes that
should be considered when supporting individual
women in clinical practice.18 A UK study using primary
care records showed that a majority of mothers registered
with a general practice had received mental health
treatment or diagnosis between the birth of their child
and the child's 16th birthday.37 Parental mental health is
strongly linked to child and adolescent mental health and
mortality in early adulthood.3S39 The high prevalence of
these parental health problems points to the need for
services in primary care, mental health, and maternity
and child health to be more responsive to the needs of
parents to improve outcomes for parents and their
children.
Our findings show disparities in adverse outcomes for
the 36% of women with one or more of the psychosocial
risk factors measured in our study. Given that our study
was not able to account for mental health problems not
recorded in hospital admission records and that we only
considered the highest quintile of deprivation, our results
are probably an underestimate of the true burden of
adverse infant outcomes in the community. Effective
interventions before, during, and after pregnancy
are needed to reduce the downstream burden on
health services and prevent long-term adverse effects for
children. Upstream, public health, and economic
strategies are important to reduce socioeconomic
disparities. Within health care, efforts are needed across
primary and secondary services to address potential
effects of psychosocial presentations among women on
pregnancy and child outcomes.

ehealth to minimize patient and clinician risk. Telehealth
during the pandemic has been associated with increased post-
partum visit attendance overall and reduced racial disparities
2,3
in attendance.
In this study, we aimed to investigate (1)
patient preferences regarding postpartum visit modalities, (2)
barriers to or facilitators of telehealth in the postpartum
period, and (3) patient experiences with postpartum tele-
health, including perception of the clinician-patient relation-
ship and contraceptive counseling.
STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a qualitative study using
individual semi-structured interviews. Methods are reported
according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualita-
tive Research guidelines. This study was approved by the
University of Pennsylvania, Institutional Review Board, and
all participants provided informed consent.
Interviews were conducted with patients who had a telehealth
postpartum visit scheduled between October 1, 2020 and Jan-
uary 1, 2021, at a single institution with no exclusions. Each
interview was performed within 2 weeks of when their
appointment was scheduled. Participants were purposively
sampled by age, race, insurance status, parity, and mode of
delivery to reflect the local patient population with the goal of
obtaining thematic saturation among both patients who were
and those who were not able to attend their visits.
Interviews were transcribed by ADA Transcription Services
(Mount Holly, NJ) and uploaded to NVivo 12 (QSR Interna-
tional, Burlington, MA). Qualitative data analysis was per-
formed using grounded theory and coded using a systematic
approach by 5 coders. All transcripts were at least coded twice
with excellent intercoder reliability (kappa=O.89).
RESULTS: A total of 25 interviews were performed. The par-
ticipant characteristics are shown in Table 1. In total, 60% of
participants attended their visit, and half of those had an in-
person postpartum visit for a previous pregnancy for compar-
ison. Representative quotes for each theme described are
shown in Table 2.
Overall, patient's perspectives on the visit modality were
mixed. Importantly, patients noted their preference was fluid
and depended on the purpose of the visit and their circum-
stances. In our sample, 64% of patients preferred an in-person
visit, and 24% preferred a telehealth visit. It was noted that
the preference of 12% of the cohort was dependent on

external factors, such as the mode of delivery and need for
further testing. Interviewees emphasized the value of shared
decision-making regarding visit modality unless otherwise
clinically indicated.
For those who attended the telehealth postpartum visit, the
majority of respondents focused on convenience as the pri-
mary facilitator. Patients described the lack of need to arrange
childcare and transportation and less time spent waiting. Par-
ticipants also discussed their ability to multitask while com-
pleting their visits, such as actively breastfeeding. In addition,
patients appreciated the ease of scheduling in-person follow-
up visits when warranted.
Participants across the groups were split when asked about
barriers to attending postpartum care. Although the majority
reported that telehealth relieved the need for childcare, some
patients expressed difficulty engaging with the appointment
because of child-related distractions. For some, childcare pre-
vented them from attending the telehealth visit altogether.
The most reported barrier among those unable to attend tele-
medicine visits was scheduling challenges. Some of these
patients also reported privacy concerns, such as the inability
to find a private space for this visit. On the other hand, most
interviewees who were able to attend reported that technolog-
ical difficulties were the biggest barrier, expressing confusion
with operating the videoconferencing application or poor
connectivity. Both groups voiced concerns about visit logis-
tics, such as needing frequent reminders, and some reported a
lack of confidence in obtaining the requested vital signs at
home.
Although most participants attending the telehealth visit
reported meaningful clinician engagement, some discussed
concerns related to clinician attention. Others reported feel-
ing that the visit lacked comprehensiveness and that, even
with video functionality, their physical examination, such as a
cesarean incision, could not be appropriately checked.
Patients reported increased comfort with telehealth if they
had met the same clinician in-person previously.
Furthermore, most participants reported having in-depth
contraceptive counseling and having their decision respected.
In contrast, some patients outlined negative experiences, dis-
cussing perceptions of pressure to decide, unawareness of
patient LGBTQ+ status, or an unclear plan on how to obtain
the desired contraception method in-person, such as an intra-
uterine device.
CONCLUSION: This qualitative analysis provides insight on
patients' preferences regarding postpartum visit types, bar-
riers to and facilitators of telehealth postpartum care, and
patient telehealth experiences, including perceptions of

"l think there are certain periods when telehealth visits is absolutely enough. But there's, I think, some critical
parts that it is better to be seen, actually be seen by a provider."
"Because juggling a newborn and that new schedule... just log in from the comfort of your own home without
having to think about what you're gonna do with the newborn and working around their schedule, it just made
it so much less stressful."
"It was nice because I'm breastfeeding an infant, so all I had to do was turn on my camera and I could continue
to take care of my daughter."
"Because right now it's a pandemic and I don't want to go inside of the building and risk my health or risk
anybody inside of that building's health. '
"Which it is hard to find a space, I guess, and a time when you're doing telehealth and you have kids at home."
"l had a telephone appointment and it never said what time it was, and I had missed the phone call."
"You feel more comfortable saying things in-person than you do over the phone and being recorded, like a
privacy thing. "
"So, the sound and image. I mean, we corrected the sound through talking on the phone. But I could see the
image was still moving. Not moving. Pausing and freezing a lot."
"It's a big difference because... I can check my blood pressure, but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly."
"[l] really wanted to have an in-person, even though the virus situation, because I would feel totally secure by
visiting the office and he has all the testings done. Because I'm pretty sure that some of the testings were also
just not done because of the telehealth visit"
"I'd much rather do a video than a phone call. I feel like that's more personal. "
"If I could barely see her [the provider], she could barely see me probably. So, she could probably barely see my
incision. And she said it was healing properly and fine, but how can you really know for sure if you don't see it
in-person ?"
"l do feel like, over telehealth, I was — there seemed to be more flexibility with the time. I definitely felt like my
appointments were longer with the telehealth calls than they were in-person. And maybe there is something to
be said about that. "
"I'd met her before in-person so it was just a pretty comforting conversation."
"[The provider] just asked what kind of birth control I wanted to do and I'm not totally sure exactly which one I
want yet. But she discussed the pros and cons of each and how each type of birth control worked...she
prescribed me something that we're thinking I'm gonna go with, but I can obviously change my mind
whenever. "

sons to improve postpartum telehealth as it continues to be a
driving care modality:
1. Make modality of visit optional based on patient prefer-
ence, unless otherwise clinically indicated.
2. Include an appointment reminder system.
3. Provide clear direction for previsit vitals.
4. Maximize continuity of care between in-person and tele-
health visits.
5. Clearly communicate plan of action for obtaining the
desired contraception.

Background. Elective single-embryo transfers are being increasingly used to curb the increase in multiple gestation rates. However,
it has been documented that single-embryo transfers could still result in twins and on rarer occasions in triplet pregnancies. Main
Body. A literature review was done to highlight the possible mechanisms leading to embryonic splitting. In this review, the
incidence of zygotic splitting was addressed and the notion of chorionicity was explained. Risk factors for zygotic splitting and
suggested mechanisms for both twin and higher order pregnancies were suggested and discussed. Conclusion. The hypotheses
that we have so far remain unproven due to the rarity of zygotic splitting as well as the ethicolegal considerations of human
embryo research. The presence of such incidents necessitates extensive counselling of the couple.
1. Introduction
Multiple gestations are the most frequent complications
associated with assisted reproductive techniques (ART). To
decrease the rate of twin and higher order multiple gesta-
tions, the elective single-embryo transfer (eSET) is currently
encouraged. However, blastocyst stage SET was still found to
be associated with multiple gestations. The present data
revealed that the frequency of embryo splitting post-eSET
is 1.36% with the rate of monozygotic twin and triplet
pregnancies being 0.9-3.1% and 0.048%, respectively [1, 2].
However, dizygotic twin and triplet pregnancies can also
be encountered post-eSET [3]. Both monozygotic and dizy-
gotic pregnancies can occur in the setting of fresh embryo
transfers, in natural or modified natural frozen embryo
transfers (FET), and rarely in medicated FET cycles [4, 5].
Such events challenge the twinning dogma proposed by
Corner [6].
2. Incidence of Zygotic Splitting after SET
Single-embryo transfer is becoming the most favored
method of ART conclusion in recent years as it decreased
the complications associated with multiple gestations. In
Japan, for example, up to 80% of cycles account for SET
[7]. However, multiple gestations in the form of mono- or
dizygotic twinning are still encountered. The classic defini-
tion of when one embryo undergoes fission into 2 or more
genetically identical embryos is called monozygotic splitting,
while when 2 different embryos implant, a dizygotic preg-
nancy ensures. According to Ikemoto et al., the rate of mul-
tiple gestation after eSET is 1.6% with the frequency of twin
and triplet pregnancies being 1.56% and 0.04%, respectively.
The frequency of zygotic splitting post-SET was estimated to
be 1.36% [2]. The findings of monochorionic and multiple
chorionic pregnancies in blastocyst eSET confirmed the fact
that embryo splitting took place after the transfer. However,

not all pregnancies are monozygotic. As per Osianlis et al.,
the calculated dizygotic rate in their paper was 0.5% with
an overall Di-Di birth rate of 1%. Based on these numbers,
they concluded that 50% of the multizygotic pregnancies
are due to actual embryo splitting while the other 50% could
be explained by concomitant natural conception at the same
time of the ART conception. On another level, the Japanese
ART national registry database along with a survey done by
Yamashita et al. documented 122 triplet pregnancies, of
which 46 were single gestational sac pregnancies, 18 were
double gestational sac pregnancies, and 59 were with 3 ges-
tational sacs. It is worth mentioning that the trichorionic
pregnancies had zero fetuses in 9 cases, 1 fetus in 12 cases,
2 fetuses in 9 cases, and three fetuses in 29 cases. One qua-
druplet case was also documented [8].
3. Chorionicity
Chorionicity refers to the placenta the origin of which can be
determined accurately. Zygosity on the other hand, which is
the origin of the fetus, can be predicted in half of the cases as
multiple gestation pregnancies can originate from one or
multiple embryos especially when the sex of the babies is dis-
cordant. Given this fact, same-sex twins or triplets could be
true monozygotic or dizygotic in origin. The only way to
accurately diagnose the zygosity is to do DNA fingerprinting
which is expensive and thus not performed in daily practice
[3]. In contrast, monochorionic multiple gestations are
always monozygotic. Originally, it was thought that the
earlier the embryonic division, the more separate and inde-
pendent the fetuses were. In other words, cleavage stage
divisions were believed to result in dichorionic diamniotic
pregnancies while blastocyst stage divisions resulted in
monochorionic monoamniotic pregnancies.
According to Konno et al., dichorionic pregnancies were
found to be more common with ART [9]. As such, we can
conclude that SET can result in monozygotic (monochorio-
nic and multichorionic) as well as dizygotic pregnancies
(multichorionic pregnancies).
4. Risk Factors
Naturally occurring twinning, especially the dizygotic form,
is believed to be linked to a genetic predisposition most com-
monly located on chromosome 3 [10, 11]. Some ethnicities
were found to be more predisposed to dizygotic twinning
where the rate reached 50/1000 in Nigeria [12]. This con-
trasts with the naturally occurring monozygotic twinning
which was found to be nonaffected by the ethnicity or the
genetic makeup of the couple [12, 13]. ART on the other
hand has increased the incidence of monozygotic twining.
It has been shown that the patient's young age might predis-
pose to zygotic twinning while unexplained infertility was
found to be protective [2]. It was proposed that ART-
associated embryo manipulations such as FET per se, blasto-
cyst culture, and assisted hatching could be risk factors for
zygotic splitting while the zona manipulation of the oocyte
in the form of intracytoplasmic sperm insemination (ICSI)
was not [2, 3, 14]. Interestingly, there was no difference in
Journal of Pregnancy
the splitting rate neither between the cleavage stage and
the blastocyst stage transfers nor between fresh and frozen
embryo transfer cycles [3]. Another risk factor for splitting
is a lower inner cell mass (ICM) grading of B or C. It is
thought that loose intercellular connections may induce
the ICM fission [15]. This has been documented through
the time-lapse imaging [16]. The quality of the culture media
is also thought to stimulate zygotic splitting. An increase in
the free radicals' concentration due to increased glucose con-
centration in the culture media used for prolonged culture
could lead to ICM splitting at the site of glucose-induced
apoptosis of certain regions of the ICM. The new sequential
culture systems with antioxidant activity might explain the
lack of increase of the rate of embryo splitting despite the
major increase in the number of IVF cycles and embryo
transfers worldwide. When coupled with the improvement
in the embryologists training and experience, the rate of
splitting associated with a blastocyst transfer has been found
to decrease [17]. The OR for embryo splitting decreased
from 2.2 to 1.7 when comparing the periods of 2007 to
2010 and 2010 to 2014 [2]. Embryo biopsy on the other
hand was not found to increase the risk of embryo splitting
contrary to what was believed before [18].
5. Suggested Mechanisms of Division
It has been shown that blastomeres from a 4-cell stage
embryo can develop into an ICM and trophectoderm; hence,
any division after this stage could give rise to 2 or more
embryos with an implantation potential [19]. Of the sug-
gested mechanisms, abnormal cellular axis formation and
cytoplasm folding in the secondary oocyte prior to fertiliza-
tion or during the actual fertilization lead to duplication. It is
speculated that gonadotropin stimulation might disrupt the
fine balance and gradients of signalling molecules affecting
the polarity of the oocyte. This is thought to lead to the for-
mation of 2 cells referred to as daughter cells or tertiary
oocytes that could be fertilized. This is speculated to be
caused by the displacement of the meiotic spindle due to
oocyte aging postovulation. This disruption might lead to
the duplication of the axes and formation of 2 embryos upon
fertilization or the fission of the ICM into 2 at the blastocyst
stage [13]. This theory would be replaced later on by the for-
mation of 2 zygotes postfertilization of the secondary oocyte
and not 2 blastomeres [20]. Other studies advocated the fis-
Sion to happen closer to the cleavage stage, and thus, the
sequence of events happening during hatching would then
explain the type of the twin gestation. If both blastocysts
were released at the same time, then the resultant pregnancy
would be a dichorionic diamniotic twin gestation. If on the
other hand the blastocysts fused with the conservation of 2
separate ICMs prior to hatching, then monochorionic
diamniotic twins would appear. If complete fusion of the
trophectoderm and the ICM happened, then monochorionic
monoamniotic twins would be created [21]. Another
suggestion was that the ICM would split due to mechanical
compression during hatching through the manipulated zona
pellucida of the embryo which is also referred to as atypical
hatching [22]. This atypical hatching is referred to as


Journal of Pregnancy
8-shaped hatching, which usually takes place when the
embryo is squeezing out through the hatch of the hardened
zona pellucida due to prolonged culture to blastocyst stage
and in cryopreserved-thawed blastocysts especially with the
application of the day 3 prehatching protocol [23, 24]. It is
speculated that this phenomenon might also be the culprit
for the monozygotic triplet gestations that have been docu-
mented post-SET [16]. Another possible explanation to dual
or even more ICM is the nature of human blastomere
plasticity. Studies have shown that isolated trophectoderm
cells when cultivated could give rise to a whole new embryo
with an implantation potential [25]. As such, if a blastomere
gets separated from the trophectoderm into the blastocele
due to low-grade compaction of the trophectoderm, this
blastomere could give rise to an ICM. Theoretically, each
ICM should give rise to a separate fetus with the surround-
ing amnion while the chorion develops during the implanta-
tion. The mechanism of chorionic differentiation between
mono and higher order chorionicity in monozygotic preg-
nancies is still unknown.
6. Triplets: Possible Explanation
The explanation of embryo splitting into three is challenging
since triplets after SET is a very rare event. What is known so
far is that to have implantation, an embryo with an intact
ICM should be present. The number of the ICM that the
embryo has will define the number of fetuses that will be
seen on the pregnancy ultrasound. The chorionicity of the
pregnancy will depend on the number of zygotes present at
the time of implantation. In theory, the chorion should rise
from trophectoderm cells; thus, it would be logical to con-
sider that the higher the order of the chorionicity, the higher
the number of separate embryos available for implantation.
In the setting of monochorionic triplets, it is believed that
the blastocyst harbors three distinct ICMs. The mechanism
of their creation might be similar to the ones suggested for
the monochorionic twin gestation. The trigger factor for
the splitting into 3 and not into 2 is still unknown. In the set-
ting of the multichorionic triplets, a suggested explanation
might be the complete division of the hatching embryos
resulting in 3 and not only 1 fully hatched embryo. Another
possible explanation for this is if the origin of the sister ICMs
is a trophectoderm blastomere. Since the implantation
potential of reconstructed embryos cannot be tested at this
point due to ethical reasons, one can only postulate that such
cellular plasticity might confer to the newly formed ICM the
whole genetic makeup necessary for a successful implanta-
tion and healthy fetal development.
The question that arises here is that whether the embryo
initially had multiple ICM followed by trophectoderm split-
ting upon hatching or the splitting of the ICM took place
during hatching due to the mechanical pressure exerted by
the hardened zona pellucida. The latter might explain the
high incidence of blighted ova in triplet pregnancies. Due
to the abnormal cell division in the embryo(s) as well as
increased cellular stress, the ICM fails to continue its
division resulting in a blighted ovum.

7. Conclusion
Zygotic splitting is a well-described event in ART, yet the
complete mechanism of these events is not completely eluci-
dated. The hypotheses that we have so far remain unproven
due to the rarity of zygotic splitting as well as the ethicolegal
considerations of human embryo research. The presence of
such incidents necessitates extensive counselling of couples
undergoing SET.

1. Introduction
Models of abortion care are continually evolving and expanding.
Historically, advocates, lawyers, journalists, clinicians, and researchers
have used a variety of terms to refer to different types of abortion. In
2004, Weitz and colleagues published an editorial laying out the need
to develop consensus on standard terms because, "the terminology
used to describe abortion procedures influences political, legislative,
and medical institutions"
Ill.
Standardization of abortion nomen-
clature and terms used to refer to different types of abortion will in-
crease uniformity and accuracy in communication about abortion care.
The Society of Family Planning's recommendation is to use the terms
medication abortion and procedural abortion for common use in clinical
guidance, journal articles, print materials, websites, media, advocacy,
policy briefs, and other communication about abortion care. These
recommendations align with recommendations from several other
organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists [2]
, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
and the
COMS Project [4 . We recognize the importance of language and its role
in providing access to care that is both equitable and that centers the
patient experience. We also recognize that language is complex and
nuanced. We encourage medical societies and others in sexual and
reproductive health, rights, and justice fields, to use these terms, while
also inviting discussion and continued research on the optimal ap-
proach to abortion nomenclature.
2. Recommendations
a. Abortion primarily with medications, including mifepristone,
misoprostol, and misoprostol alone, should be referred to as
medication abortion regardless of the setting, context, gestational
duration, or legal status.
Conflicts of interest: The authors report no conflicts. The Society of Family Planning receives no direct support from pharmaceutical companies or other industries for the
development of clinical guidance.

U.D. Upadhyay, L. Coplon and J.M. Atrio
Historically, a variety of terms have been used to refer to medi-
cation abortion: medical abortion, RU486, the abortion pill(s),
abortion with pills, pharmaceutical abortion, medicinal abortion, no
test abortion, no touch abortion, medically induced, and induction
termination.
The term medication abortion is now widely used in the United
States which suggests ease of comprehension and adoption by the
media, advocates, and policy-makers. It is also the accepted term in
clinical practice and scientific publications. However, widespread
public knowledge that one can end a pregnancy with medications
remains limited. In a 2021-2022 nationally representative survey of
participants assigned female at birth, 64% were aware of medication
abortion [5]. In another study done in 2022, less than a third (27%) of
U.S. adults reported having heard of mifepristone
161.
Furthermore,
people who report being aware of medication abortion often erro-
neously confuse it with emergency contraception
[7,8].
The term medication abortion is preferable because the me-
chanism—that medications are involved—is intuitively understood
(unlike medical abortion). "Medical" may imply that the abortion is
being done for medical reasons, is a medical necessity, or requires a
complication of pregnancy to be completed. "Medical" also implies
the medical infrastructure or health care system is required or in-
volved. However, medication abortion can also safely occur outside
of the formal health care system, as with self-managed medication
abortion
[9-11]
. Greater use of the term medication abortion may
facilitate and expand public knowledge that an abortion with pills
exists as an option.
b. Abortion primarily with instrumentation, including uterine as-
piration (manual or electric), dilation and curettage, dilation and
evacuation, or dilation and extraction should be referred to as
procedural abortion or abortion procedure regardless of the set-
ting, context, pregnancy duration, or legal status.
The following terms have been used to refer to procedural
abortion: surgical, aspiration, in-clinic procedure, instrumentation,
surgery, put to sleep, anesthesia abortion, manual/electric vacuum
aspiration, suction abortion, and uterine scraping. The term proce-
dural abortion conveys that it involves a mechanical intervention
that is facilitated by a skilled clinician
[4]
. This avoids creating ar-
tificial distinctions based on the stage of the pregnancy (e.g., by
trimester), specific tools, or resources available to the clinician or
setting. The term procedural abortion may be new for patients, but
greater use of this term may facilitate a more accurate under-
standing of what it involves.
The term procedural abortion groups multiple clinical abortion
techniques using a common term. For specific documents or con-
texts, such as medical charts, research, or patient counseling, spe-
cifying the technique used to perform the abortion procedure may
be necessary
[12].
While there is greater variation in preferred nomenclature for this
type of abortion, there is broad consensus that the terms "surgical" and
"dilation & curettage" should be avoided. The term procedural avoids a
false suggestion that the procedure involves incisions. "Surgical abor-
[13]
obfuscating the training requirements for
tion" is a misnomer
provision. Physician assistants, nurse practitioners, midwives, and
other clinicians who are not clearly labeled as surgeons can provide
high-quality and safe procedural abortion care [14 . The use of the term
surgical has fueled a perception that abortion carries substantial risks
[151
when it is in fact an essential and extremely safe intervention
116,171.
Labeling abortion procedures as surgery may evoke for the
patient scary imagery of a sterile surgical suite with scalpels and
monitors that is inconsistent with offce-based care, contributes to
wider misunderstanding
[1,181
, and provides an erroneous rationale
that abortion care must be done in an ambulatory surgical center. Most
procedural abortions are safely completed in an outpatient clinical care
Contraception 126 (2023) 110094
setting, similar to an intrauterine device (IUD) insertion, and do not
[191.
The complexity of support services required is
require surgery
usually related to the type of pain relief (anesthesia or analgesia) of-
fered to the patient rather than the abortion procedure performed. The
term "dilation and curettage" is also a misnomer as guidelines re-
commend against the practice of using a sharp curette to scrape the
uterus and it is no longer the recommended primary method used in a
procedural abortion
[20].
3. Continued discussion
During the development of this document we identified multiple
areas where further discussion, research, and consensus are needed
specific to abortion nomenclature and terminology:
4.
Qualifiers such as induced, spontaneous, missed, medically in-
dicated, and elective, are often used to describe abortion or in
efforts to distinguish abortion from pregnancy loss or to differ-
entiate why a patient is seeking abortion
[21,221.
Although out-
side the original scope of the document, it is important to uplift
this conversation as it directly impacts the broader abortion
nomenclature paradigm. On a policy level, using disparate lan-
guage to describe care reinforces abortion stigma, enabling leg-
islation that limits patients' options
There seems to be
consensus that qualifiers such as medically indicated and elective
are not needed when describing abortion or pregnancy loss in
clinical guidance, research publications, print materials, websites,
media, advocacy, legislation, and other communication with the
public. However, more work is needed to explore how to best use
the terms recommended in this guidance and still recognize the
patient-preferred language in individual counseling
[23].
Current international classification of disease (ICD) and current
procedural terminology (CPT) codes for pregnancy loss and
abortion include descriptors such as "missed" and "induced,"
which may contribute to confusion, stigma, and bias.
Consideration should be given to using medication and procedural
to describe the management of pregnancy loss (i.e., medication
management of pregnancy loss and procedural management of
pregnancy loss).
The terms medication abortion and procedural abortion may not
translate into other languages or be used commonly in practice
outside of the United States. More work is needed in order to
explore and uplift ideal terminology in languages other than
English and to build international consensus.
The terms gestational duration and pregnancy duration may be
preferable to the term gestational age which personifies the fetus.
Conclusion
As abortion care models expand, we need to review our termi-
nology and refine our language as needed. These recommended
terms may continue to evolve, and we invite continued discussion
and research on the topic among all stakeholders. Additionally, for
specific documents or contexts, such as medical charts and research,
further clarification, detail, and definitions may be needed to de-
scribe the specific type of intervention and model of care. When
counseling people seeking to end a pregnancy, there may be a
need to use terminology that is aligned with each individual's un-
derstanding and values. However, for common use in clinical gui-
dance, research publications, print materials, websites, media,
advocacy, legislation, and other communication with the public, we
encourage those in the sexual and reproductive health, rights, and
justice fields to use the terms medication abortion and procedural
abortion. Using uniform language will support greater shared public
knowledge of the different abortion types, minimize myths and
misperceptions, and ensure public discussions reflect the latest
2

preferred terminology. Given that abortion is increasingly in public
discourse, and the terminology used to describe abortion influences
political, legislative, and medical institutions, the use of standard
terminology is as important as ever.

Purpose. Studies focusing on safety outcomes typically require large populations to comprehensively characterise the patient
groups exposed to the medicines under investigation. However, there is often less information for subpopulations, such as
pregnant or breastfeeding women, particularly when new medicines are considered. It is important to understand what
information can be obtained from drug utilization studies (DUS) involvmg pregnant women in the early years postmarketing
to provide supportive information for safety studies. The aims of this literature review are to (1) identify and review DUS for
new medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding and (2) list and summarise key information items to be reported in a DUS for
new medicines in pregnancy. Methods. To identify postmarketing DUS of new prescription medicines or enantiomers in
pregnancy, a systematic literature review was undertaken in PubMed and Embase between January 2015 and June 2022. In
addition, the complete database of the ENCePP EU PAS Register was systematically searched to June 2022. Results. We
identified 11 published DUS on new medicines in pregnancy from the ENCePP EU PAS Register and none from other sources.
No studies on breastfeeding were identified. The 11 identified publications reported the medicme's use for the first 3 to 5 years
after marketing approval. No reports assessed utilization in the first 3 years of approval. It was usual to issue interim reports
annually (7 studies). All studies concerned conditions managed in ambulatory care (primary care and outpatient facilities) and
included some primary care prescribing. Most (n = 8) only had prescribing/dispensing data available at individual level for
ambulatory care; outpatient prescribing was included in three of these studies Three studies held a limited amount of in-hospital
prescribing data. A DUS can confirm at an early stage whether there are suffcient exposed pregnancies m available data sources to
ensure a safety study is powered to detect a difference in the prevalence of adverse pregnancy or infant outcomes or if additional
data from other databases are needed. A DUS may also help address methodological considerations such as selection of
comparators. DUS can be performed embedded in a DUS in the general population, in a cohort of women of childbearing age, or
in a cohort of pregnant women. Conclusion. This review summarises key aspects of a DUS for new medicines in pregnancy. DUS
for new medicines in pregnancy should be planned before marketing, scheduled for the first 3 to 5 years after release, with annual
interim/progress reports, and reported in peer-reviewed journals. By offering detailed information on data sources, exposure
timing, prevalence and location, coprescribing, comorbidities, coexposures, and demographics, a DUS will offer a firm foundation
for safety studies and will help to contextuahze spontaneous reporting of serious adverse events.

1. Introduction
Humans are exposed to new medicines for the first time in
the context of preapproval clinical trials. However, some
95% of the clinical trials exclude pregnant and breastfeeding
women due to ethical, legal, and safety concerns of repro-
ductive toxicity of the new medicine [1]. Therefore, informa-
tion regarding the use of new medicines during pregnancy
and breastfeeding is often listed as missing in the summary
of product characteristics, and a postapproval plan is needed
to evaluate the safety of the newly approved product.
During drug development and before marketing authori-
zation is granted, the safety of a new medicine is evaluated in
preclinical studies, including reproductive toxicity studies in
mammals. In addition, the safety information for new medi-
cines may be supplemented by pooling data from patients
who unexpectedly become pregnant during the preapproval
clinical trials [2]. In the absence of safety concerns or signals
related to pregnancy exposure during drug development, once
the new medicine is on the market, it is subjected to safety
monitoring using pharmacovigilance procedures [3]. Solicited
or spontaneous reports of suspected adverse drug reactions
(ADRs), including adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., congen-
ital anomalies) and pregnancy exposure with and without
ADRs, are collected by marketing authorization holders and
regulatory authorities (such as the EMA); however, it is esti-
mated that only 5% of all ADRs are spontaneously reported
[4], and reporting is vulnerable to bias [5]. Therefore, there
is a need to supplement spontaneous reports and solicited
reports of ADRs, with data from other sources [6], for exam-
ple, by secondary use of routinely collected healthcare data,
to further investigate the potential harms, risks, and benefits.
Use of whole-population data removes selection bias including
volunteer bias [7]. Even if use of a medicine is not recom-
mended or contraindicated in pregnancy, women unaware
of their pregnancies may receive a prescription or there may
be no alternative to treat maternal conditions. Therefore,
many new medicines are first used in secondary or tertiary
care, under specialist supervision; however, some healthcare
databases do hold information on hospital prescribing. DUS
were defined by the World Health Organization as studies
which study the marketing, distribution, prescription, and
use of medicinal products in a society, with special emphasis
on the resulting medical and socioeconomic consequences.
The thalidomide tragedy may have faded from public
consciousness, but the failure to act on the teratogenicity
and neurodevelopmental harms of valproic acid derivatives
for over two decades (from 1984 to 2018) indicates that
the problem persists [8]. It has been reported that it takes
on average 27 years (95% confidence interval (CI) 26-28
years) to determine the safety of a new medicine in pregnant
women [9]; therefore, there is a need to help expedite the
safety evaluation for new medicines and enantiomers. A
drug utilization study (DUS) can help by adding effciency
to medication safety evaluation during pregnancy.
Several guidelines [10—12] and books [13, 14] consider
DUS in the general, nonpregnant population. The book
Drug Utilization Research: Methods and Applications pre-
sents a broad introduction to drug utilization measures
Journal of Pregnancy
and research [14]. The World Health Organization's guide-
line focuses on establishing a DUS [10]. ENCEPP Safe-
GUARD provides examples of DUS [12], and Rasmussen
et al. list the core concepts that can be used in DUS; these
authors list appropriate analytical approaches for designing
a DUS (e.g., basic epidemiological measures, adherence,
combinations of medicines, switching, polypharmacy, and
drug misuse) [11]. A tool was developed in 2000 to assess
the quality of DUS and drug utilization reviews; however,
this tool was created for primary data collection, often in
relation to audit or prescribing quality, rather than pharma-
coepidemiological studies involving routine healthcare data-
bases [15]. The EQUATOR network offers guidelines on
observational studies [16] and pharmacoepidemiological
studies using routine healthcare data [17]. To our knowl-
edge, there is no specific guideline for DUS during preg-
nancy using secondary data sources that details items to be
captured, recorded, and reported. The objectives of this liter-
ature review are to (1) identify and review DUS for new
medicines in pregnancy and breastfeeding, (2) list and sum-
marise key information items to be reported in a DUS for
new medicines (in the last 5 years) in pregnancy, and (3)
report on the earliest timeframe between introduction to
the market and evaluation of DUS during pregnancy.
This publication is part of the Innovative Medicines Ini-
tiative (IMI) ConcePTION project, which aims to build an
ecosystem for better monitoring and communication of
medication safety in pregnancy and breastfeeding. The
results of this study will help guide future DUS for new
drugs in pregnancy and potentially breastfeeding (breast-
feeding was omitted due to lack of data).
2. Methods
2.1. Literature Search. To identify postmarketing DUS of new
medicines in pregnancy, a systematic review was undertaken
in two stages. In 2022, PubMed, Embase, and the ENCePP
EU PAS Register were searched. The publication date was lim-
ited to 01.01.2015 through 01.07.2022. The search was
restricted to publications in English (for further details on
the search strategy, see Appendix). The inclusion criterion
was assessment of the utilization of new medicines during
pregnancy or breastfeeding. "New" medicines were defined
as those that reached the market within 5 years of the date of
data analysis or review. New medicines include new mole-
cules, enantiomers, generics/biosimilars, and formulations.
In addition, data were collected on routes of administration
and indications. In the ENCePP EU PAS Register [18], "preg-
nancy" were selected as "other population" and "drug utiliza-
tion study" was selected under "scope of study." (The register
did not have an option to search "breastfeeding/lactation".)
Studies identified via the ENCePP EU PAS Register were
included if they mentioned that they were going to study drug
utilization in pregnancy or breastfeeding in their protocol.
2.2. Screening. Studies with only the abstract available were
excluded.
All titles and abstracts were initially screened to identify
DUS. Full texts of potentially relevant studies were then

screened to determine final eligibility. Two reviewers (SLL,
JS) independently reviewed the search results for inclusion
narrowing potential studies successively in three stages: by
title, by abstract, and by full manuscript.
2.3. Data Extraction. Five reviewers (JS, KW, MS, JM, and
DM) undertook data extraction from the included studies
using a data extraction Excel sheet. Information on key
aspects of a DUS was extracted from the title, introduction,
methods, tables, results, and discussion of each included study.
The key aspects of the studies were the pertinent items of
information reported. Each study was scrutinized by two
researchers independently, and findings were compared. The
findings were consistent, and there were no disagreements.
2.4. Data Synthesis. All the extracted information from the
included studies was captured in Excel tables.
2.5. Developing Recommendations. Information items
reported in the published studies and protocols were tabu-
lated in an Excel file. Once the items were identified, we
returned to all 11 studies and calculated the number of stud-
ies reporting each information item. This number is
included next to each item and helps us understand which
items are commonly included.
3. Results
After removing the duplicates, a total of 2,284 unique poten-
tially relevant studies were identified in PubMed and
Embase. However, none of the studies were DUS for new
drugs. The search in the ENCePP EU PAS Register identified
104 studies. Thirty-seven studies were excluded because they
did not include a study concept, protocol, or study report
(n = 35) or because they were not in English (n = 2). Of the
67 studies screened, 40 were DUS. Twenty-three were
excluded because they did not study a new drug, and 6 were
excluded because they did not included data on either preg-
nancy or breastfeeding (Figure 1, PRISMA).
In total, 11 DUS posted in the ENCEPP EU PAS Register
within 3 years after EMA medicine approval were included
for review. There were 3 studies including information on
use of medications during pregnancy in which only the pro-
tocol was available; for these, we extracted information
related to the methods. The other 8 studies presented study
reports. For all these, information was extracted from these
to describe the components to be considered when con-
ducting DUS of new medicines. No studies considering
breastfeeding were identified.
The patients were prescribed either a specific medicine
or a drug class. There was only one study that exclusively
studied pregnant women (study 27574, Table 1) and one
study that focused on women of childbearing age (study
11841, Table 1). The other studies evaluated drug utilization
in the general population for all users of the medicine(s) in
question and included a subgroup analysis of the estimated
prevalence of prescribing the medicine of interest to preg-
nant women. Four studies reported that there were no preg-
nant women prescribed the medicine (studies 4845, 13783,
9507, and 17062, Table 1), and two did not mention preg-
nant women in the report but did in their protocol (studies

12839 and 14445, Table 1). One study identified 462 preg-
nant women (study 4270, Table 1), and one identified 1
pregnant woman (study 3901, Table 1). The studies identify-
ing zero pregnancies within the first 3-4 years of marketing
were for the drugs fidaxomicin, dulaglutide, and glycopyrro-
nium bromide.
The studies identified addressed conditions largely man-
aged in ambulatory care (primary care and/or outpatient facil-
ities), mainly long-term conditions: migraine (2-36014,
27574), type 2 diabetes (3-13783, 14445, and 11841), throm-
bosis (1-17062), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/
COPD (1-4845), irritable bowel syndrome/IBS (1-12839), cys-
tic fibrosis (1-4270), gastric acidity (1-3901), and Clostridium
difflcile (1-9507). All studies included some primary care pre-
scribing. Most studies (n = 8) only had prescribing/dispensing
data available at individual level for ambulatory care; three of
these included some outpatient prescribing (4845, 27574,
and 12839). Three studies held a limited amount of in-
hospital prescribing data (17062, 4270), sometimes for just 1
participating centre (36014). Primary care studies included
whole populations and in several countries. The duration of
the studies ranged from 3 to 5 years and most reported interim
results annually. No reports addressed utilization of new med-
icines during breastfeeding. Details of these 11 studies can be
found in Table 1, appended.
3.1. Information Included in DUS for New Medicines in
Pregnancy. Items of information useful to or needed in a
DUS for a medicine new to market identified in at least
one study are presented below, in the order of the sections
of a pharmacoepidemiological study protocol. Since not all
DUS have the same objectives, there can be no "one size fits
all," and studies should be evaluated case by case. The col-
umn on the right, in all the tables below, represents the total
number of studies presenting that item, from a total of 11.
3.1.1. Items for a DUS: Title and Abstract. We recommend
that study type be specified with commonly used terms, such
as "Drug Utilization Study", "observational", and "preg-
nancy". The abstract should name the specific medicine(s)/
class, indication(s), geographical region(s), setting, and data-
bases deployed, as in all the studies identified.

background and rationale for the DUS, the items in Table 2

medicines for the same indications/disease
and clinical safety data on the medicine and similar medicines
during pregnancy. If information on safety in pregnancy or
breastfeeding is unknown, this should be stated.
For a new medicine on the market, readers will need to
understand when the new medicine was approved by regula-
tory authorities and when it was launched and available in
the countries/regions under investigation. There are cases
where there is a considerable delay between the regulatory
approval date and the availability of the new medicine in
routine care, mainly driven by reimbursement decisions
[19], guidelines, or prescribers' caution. There may be fur-
ther delays before data are available for research, due to time
lag in the databases. Table 2 lists information that is perti-
nent to contextualization of the results of a DUS. If informa-
tion is unobtainable or unknown, this should be noted.
The last part of the introduction should explain the pur-
pose of conducting the DUS. Table 3 describes appropriate
objectives for DUS. For example, a DUS can help determine
whether the contributing databases are adequate for possible
further safety studies on a new medicine (e.g., if the medi-
cine and timing of administration are fully recorded).
3.1.3. Items for a DUS: Methods and Results
(1) Databases. Table 4 lists items to be considered in the
methods and results section of a DUS for a new medicine.
DUS typically use large population-based databases, e.g.,
prescription databases, reimbursement claims databases, or
linked health service records. If the DUS is used to plan a
future pregnancy safety study, the numbers of exposed and
unexposed pregnancies in the DUS can be used to determine
the achievable level of precision for the risk of predefined
adverse pregnancy outcomes. If several databases are
included, results should be stratified by country/database to
identify similarities and differences between databases. This
will determine if it is appropriate to plan a meta-analysis
or aggregated multilevel analysis in further studies. Potential
confounding factors should be included to address threats to
validity: in real-world settings, any associations between
maternal medicines and infant outcomes may be con-
founded by concomitant exposures and demographic fac-
tors. All possible confounding variables should be
described by group, with or without inferential analyses.
3.1.4. Items for a DUS: Considerations for Study Discussion.
Table 5 describes topics that should be considered for inclu-
Sion in the discussion section.
4. Discussion
We identified very few published DUS designed to deter-
mine the use of new medicines in pregnant or breastfeeding
women. Most studies were aimed at determining if pregnant
women were taking the medicine of interest. From the eight
studies that presented results, five did not identify any
women prescribed the medicine of interest and two did not
present any information on pregnancy in their study reports.
Publication bias is possible given that studies identifying
zero or very few exposed pregnant women may not be pub-
lished or if <5 pregnant women exposed this may not be
published due to governance restrictions on reporting of
low numbers [20]. Low numbers of recorded exposures dur-
ing pregnancy or breastfeeding during the medicine's first
years on the market militates against safety assessments
should the medicine be used by these vulnerable groups.
Establishing consortia of databases including primary, sec-
ondary and tertiary care data for DUS in pregnancy and
breastfeeding would address this problem [21, 22]. If no
exposed pregnancies are identified across several whole-
population databases, with primary, secondary, and tertiary
care prescribing, it would suggest that the medicine is not
being prescribed to pregnant women and further safety

studies needing large samples would be premature; mean-
while, voluntary adverse event reporting databases should
be scrutinized for serious adverse events, including congen-
ital anomalies.
The studies identified addressed conditions generally man-
aged in ambulatory care, and ten of 11 reported on long-term
conditions. However, many new medicines are introduced in
secondary and tertiary care, as this is where most severe condi-
tions and sickest patients are treated. New medicines are most
frequently developed for the most serious conditions: for exam-
ple, in the UK, in 2021, 56 of 155 new products launched were
to treat immunological and malignant disorders and 13 for the
next highest categories (cardiovascular and infectious diseases)
[23]. However, eight of 11 publications identified had no in-
hospital prescribing data, and five had only primary care pre-
scribing, although some of the regimens recorded may be initi-
ated by specialists based in secondary or tertiary care (Table 1).
DUS on new medicines for immunological and malignant dis-
orders were not located, despite this being the largest prescrib-
ing category [23]. Large-scale patient data on hospital
prescribing are scarce [24, 25]. Many routine healthcare data-
bases, particularly in Europe, do not include in-hospital pre-
scribing, and therefore, if the medicine is restricted to hospital
use, it is not possible to undertake a DUS [26]. For example,
most intravenous medicines, particularly anticancer treatments,
are administered in hospitals and not reliably recorded in pri-
mary care. Therefore, restricting a DUS to ambulatory or pri-
mary care without first ascertaining use in secondary care
may generate misleading and invalid conclusions regarding
prevalence of exposure in pregnancy.
There was only one study that exclusively studied preg-
nant women and only one study that focused on women of
childbearing age. The other nine studies evaluated drug utili-
zation in the general population for all users of the medicine(s)
in question: as a stratification they estimated the frequency of
pregnant women prescribed the medicine of interest. Three of
these studies stated in their protocol that they intended to
assess utilization in pregnancy; however, when the results were
published, no data on pregnancy was presented. EMA guide-
lines [27] on registry-based studies state that feasibility analy-
ses may be submitted separately or as part of a proposed
protocol for a registry-based study. However, it is also impor-
tant to publish information derived from pregnancies in feasi-
bility studies, as this can guide the protocols of future studies.
The methods used for DUS of older products are very
similar to those identified for new products. Most DUS for
new and established medicines focus on estimating the num-
ber of pregnant women prescribed the medicine. When new
medicines are considered, initially few people are exposed,
militating against a comprehensive evaluation of some areas
of concern, particularly pregnancy and breastfeeding. The
objective of a DUS for a new product should be to expedite,
facilitate, and guide the assessment of safety concerns during
pregnancy. Drug safety studies can be planned in parallel or
sequentially using the same databases as the DUS. As
observed in several of the studies, the protocol of a DUS
can be written before the medicine is on the market. When
planned as a phased approach, the main objective may be to
determine when there is enough power to perform a safety
Journal of Pregnancy
study. Determining sample size ensures that risk estimates
are precise: if a study is too small, it will yield wide confidence
intervals and imprecise estimates. Other DUS objectives
include identification and prevalence of risk factors that may
be confounders such as comedications, comorbidities, smok-
ing, age, education, body weight, substance misuse, and any
differences between exposed and nonexposed populations
(particularly women of childbearing age). The DUS will also
generate knowledge of the unique characteristics of the data
sources regarding medicine exposure and can establish the
strengths and limitations of each database, so that a range of
databases can be considered to account for known risk factors.
For example, the Nordic databases hold data on paternity,
while Wales holds data on substance misuse [28]. When a
DUS is conducted in parallel with a safety study, the informa-
tion can inform decision points as to phasing and interpreting
the safety study results. However, complete and accurate data
linkage is essential for safety studies [28].
4.1. Limitations and Strengths. The biggest limitation of this
systematic review is that very few DUS for new drugs are
being published. There were insufficient studies to illustrate
good practice; however, the available studies offered an over-
view of the optimal structure for a DUS in this field
(Tables 2—5) [16, 17]. These were considered in association
with existing reporting guidelines [16, 17]. A central prob-
lem with DUS for new medicines in pregnancy is the
absence of whole population databases for hospital prescrib-
ing. Prescription and administration data have been cap-
tured electronically for many years in most hospitals;
however, even some well-established national healthcare
databases have been unable to link this key data. Therefore,
pharmacoepidemiologists can only investigate potential
adverse effects of medicines amongst the less-ill primary care
population, while key signals for harm are missed due to the
fragmentation of data capture for the vulnerable, unwell
hospital population. New technical, financial, and gover-
nance barriers are not immutable, and integrated databases
may well emerge in the future. While the majority of preg-
nant women are healthy, a few experience serious health
problems, whose treatment can only be evaluated from hos-
pital prescribing data; the rarity of serious illness in preg-
nancy necessitates combining data from large populations.
Comprehensive information is even more important for
safety studies, particularly where prescribing is expected to
be low or minimized due to manufacturers' warnings
regarding unknown safety in pregnancy or contraindica-
tions. By accounting for all the items listed above,
researchers increase the likelihood that the only remaining
plausible explanation for harm identified is the prescribed
medicine. We made no recommendation in relation to
breastfeeding, because no studies reported drug utilization
during or preceding breastfeeding: very few databases hold
data on breastfeeding [29].
5. Conclusions
This review of DUS for medicines new to the market illus-
trates how DUS might add efficiency to the evaluation of


Journal of Pregnancy
medicines during pregnancy. A DUS supports safety studies
by providing
(i) early confirmation as to whether there are suffcient
exposed pregnancies to provide adequate statistical
power to detect an association with an adverse preg-
nancy outcome
(ii) context and information to evaluate whether addi-
tional data from other data sources or more time
are needed
(iii) information on the most appropriate data sources
to use
(iv) guidance on the optimal methods for a safety study,
such as selection of comparator medicines or
participants
These considerations are particularly relevant where
adverse outcomes are relatively common, and with multiple
aetiologies, for example, small for gestational age or absence of
breastfeeding following antidepressant exposure [30]. This does
not detract from the reporting of major congenital anomalies.
This paper offers suggestions as to considerations when
planning and reporting DUS for new drugs in pregnant
women. Such studies may be planned before marketing,
either embedded in a DUS in the general population or in
a retrospective cohort of pregnant women, typically for the
first 3 to 5 years after release, with annual interim/progress
reports. These reports may provide patient numbers or sta-
tus progress updates to guide safety studies and augment
interpretation of spontaneous pharmacovigilance reports,
which start as soon as the drug is marketed. The results of
these interim reports/final reports should be available in peer
reviewed journals, so that researchers and physicians can
access the information easily. DUS for new drugs and safety
studies can be planned with a phased or parallel approach to
expedite the knowledge generation regarding the safety of
medicines used during pregnancy and breastfeeding.

Additional Points
Note on Terminology. In the term "drug utilisation study"
(DUS), "drug" is used adjectivally, in line with MeSH termi-
nology. When referring to medicinal products, we have used
the term "medicine," as this paper only describes prescribed
products used in the treatment of illness (OED medicine,
n. 1: Oxford English Dictionary (http://oed.com)). There are
no references to recreational drugs in this paper. See the fol-
lowing: Glossary breastfeeding confounding WPI Docu-

When medicines are introduced to the market, there is lim-
ited information available related to human pregnancy, pla-
cental transfer, foetal elimination, childbirth, lactation, and
breastfeeding. This study lists and summarises key informa-
tion items to be reported in a drug utilization studies for new
medicines that may be used in pregnancy. (ii) A DUS can

Abstract
Background: Pregnancy is a period of transition with important physical and emotional changes. Even in
uncomplicated pregnancies, these changes can affect the quality of life (QOL) of pregnant women, affecting both
maternal and infant health. The objectives of this study were to describe the quality of life during uncomplicated
pregnancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic, physical and psychological factors in developed
countries.
Methods: A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were made in
PubMed, EMBASE and BDSP (Public Health Database). Two independent reviewers extracted the data. Countries
with a human development index over 0.7 were selected. The quality of the articles was evaluated on the basis of
the STROBE criteria.
Results: In total, thirty-seven articles were included. While the physical component of QOL decreased throughout
pregnancy, the mental component was stable and even showed an improvement during pregnancy. Main factors
associated with better QOL were mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age, the absence of social and
economic problems, having family and friends, doing physical exercise, feeling happiness at being pregnant and
being optimistic. Main factors associated with poorer QOL were medically assisted reproduction, complications
before or during pregnancy, obesity, nausea and vomiting, epigastralgia, back pain, smoking during the months
prior to conception, a history of alcohol dependence, sleep difficulties, stress, anxiety, depression during pregnancy
and sexual or domestic violence.
Conclusions: Health-related quality of life refers to the subjective assessment of patients regarding the physical,
mental and social dimensions of well-being. Improving the quality of life of pregnant women requires better
identification of their difficulties and guidance which offers assistance whenever possible.
Keywords: Quality of life, Pregnancy, Primary care, Health-related quality of life, Measurement
Background
According to the World Health Organization, quality of
life (QOL) is defined as "individuals' perception of their
position in life in the context of the culture and value sys-
tems in which they live and in relation to their goals, ex-
pectations, standards and concerns. This is a very broad
concept, and one that can be influenced in a complex
way by the physical health of the subject, his or her psy-
chological state and level of independence, social

health-related quality of life (HRQOL) [2].

outcomes, maternal postpartum health, and the psycho-
motor development of the infant) [4—8]. Health profes-
sionals in the field of prenatal maternal and child health
try to satisfy their patients with respect to their experi-
ence during preconception and pregnancy periods [2].
Traditionally used pregnancy outcome measures, such
as morbidity and mortality rates, remain essential. How-
ever, they are not sufficient on their own because popu-
lation health should be assessed, not only on the basis of
saving lives, but also in terms of improving quality of life
Over the past decades, numerous instruments have
been developed to measure HRQOL in various patient
populations, with 2 basic approaches: generic and
disease-specific [10]. While generic measures (for ex-
ample the SF-36 Short-Form Item 36 and
WHOQOL-BREF World Health Organization's Quality
of Life Scale) have broad application across different
types and severity of diseases, disease-specific measures
are designed to assess particular diseases or patient pop-
ulations. To our knowledge, there is no review of the lit-
erature to describe the quality of life of pregnant women
in primary care. The objectives of this study were to de-
scribe the quality of life during uncomplicated preg-
nancy and to assess its associated socio-demographic,
physical and psychological factors in developed
countries.
Methods
Type of study
The study consisted of a systematic review of the litera-
ture in the PUBMED, EMBASE and BDSP databases
(BDSP is the French Public Health Database). The
search was performed according to the Preferred Report-
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) criteria.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria
were developed by the whole group of authors after
which two authors (LN and IG) individually con-
ducted the literature search. Key search terms in-
cluded "Pregnancy", "Quality of life", or "Health
related quality of life". Search terms were selected
with reference to relevant index terms (MeSH, Emtree
or Thesaurus). All observational studies (e.g., cohort,
cross-sectional, case-control) which were published in
English and French prior to March 2016 have been
considered (no restriction in the starting date). Devel-
oped countries were chosen as a basis for the re-
search to ensure epidemiological uniformity. In order
to define a list of developed countries comparable to
France, countries with a human development index
(HDI) of over 0.7 were selected. This list, provided by
Page 2 of 14
the United Nations (UN), is available online [11].
Studies measuring quality of life with a single ques-
tion were excluded [12, 13]. Studies on specific popu-
lations (women with complicated pregnancy) or on a
specific scale of quality of life (sexual HRQOL or
HRQOL in relation to faecal incontinence, etc.) were
also excluded, as it is not possible to compare pa-
tients with different pathologies.
HRQOL measurement
The most frequently used HRQOL instruments during
pregnancy are the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form
36 survey (SF-36), the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form 12 survey (SF-12), the World Health Organiza-
tion's Quality of Life Scale (WHOQOL) and the World
Health Organization's Quality of Life Scale — BREF
(WHOQOL - Bref).
The SF-36 includes 36 items and collects information
on eight health concepts including, physical functioning,
role limitations due to physical and emotional health,
mental health, bodily pain, general health, vitality and
social functioning. These items are scored providing a
component summary scale score for both mental
(SF36-MCS) and physical (SF36-PCS) HRQOL (from O
to 100) [14]. The SF-12 is a validated shortened version
of the SF-36. A lower score on the summary scales rep-
resents a poorer HRQOL.
The WHOQOL includes 100 questions grouped into 6
categories (physical, psychological, independence, social,
environmental and spiritual) (from O to 100). The
WHOQOL-BREF instrument comprises 26 items and is
a validated shortened version of the WHOQOL. A lower
score on the summary scales represents a poorer
HRQOL.
Article selection and quality assessment
A preliminary selection was made from the titles, then
another on reading the summaries and a lastly on a
reading of the entire article. Publications "related" to the
selected articles as well as the bibliography of the se-
lected articles were also examined. Two independent re-
viewers extracted the data (LN and IG). Disagreement
between reviewers was resolved by consensus. The qual-
ity of the articles was evaluated using the STROBE cri-
teria (ST rengthening the Reporting of OBservational
studies in Epidemiology) [15].
Analysis
The results were organised in two sections: first, a descrip-
tion of the quality of life of pregnant women in developed
countries and second, by the socio-demographic, physical
and psychological factors associated with their quality of
life. When the study compared two quality of life scales,
we used only the "Gold Standard" scale. In the


Lagadec et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth
(2018) 18:455
case-control studies where the controls were a particular
subgroup, we have retained the "control" group that was
most representative of the general population of pregnant
women, where all subjects in the study would have re-
sulted in a serious selection bias.
Results
Article selection
The article selection is described in Fig. 1. Of the 1487
articles retrieved, 37 were selected for our analysis (Fig.
1 and Table 1). The methodological quality was rated
from 11 to 22 in the selected articles. The selected arti-
cles were published between 2001 and 2016. The sam-
ples of pregnant women included in the studies varied
between 55 and 12,056 women. Concerning the design
of the selected studies, twenty were cross-sectional stud-
ies [16—35], four were case-controlled studies [36—38],
and fourteen were longitudinal cohort studies [14, 39—
51]. Thirteen studies were conducted during the first
Page 3 of 14
trimester of pregnancy [17, 20, 22, 23, 26, 30, 38—40,
44—47], eleven were from the second trimester [14, 16,
24, 35, 38—41, 45, 46, 48], eighteen were from the 3rd
trimester [14, 18, 19, 27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 37-42, 46, 48-
50] and six studies focused on the entire pregnancy [25,
28, 32, 36, 43, 51]. In measuring the quality of life, nine-
teen studies used SF-36 [14, 17—19, 21, 22, 25—27, 30,
33, 34, 38—41, 44, 46, 51], twelve studies used SF-12 [16,
20, 23, 24, 28, 29, 35, 42, 43, 46, 48, 50], two studies used
the WHOQOL Brief [32, 47], one study used The Duke
Health Profile [49], and another Nottingham Health Pro-
file [31].
The quality of life of pregnant women
Comparison with the general population
The quality of life of pregnant women was generally
lower than that of the general population. Two stud-
ies explicitly compared their results with those of

List of abbreviations: QOL Quality of life, aFirst research question: quality of life of pregnant women in developed countries; second research question: factors
associated with their quality of life
scale, Da Costa et al. found physical activity and
physical pain values equal to 56.7 and 61.7; these
values were 90.9 and 75.0 for non-pregnant Canadian
women of the same age [18]. Similarly, Nakamura et
al. made similar comparisons in Japan [38]. The Chan
et al. study in 2010 also found that pregnant women
had, on average, statistically lower QOL scores (p <
0.001) compared to the general population, excepting
general health (p = 0.1) [17, 18]. Similarly, Elsenbruch
et al. [20] found a reduced quality of life, physically,
when compared to German women of the same age
(p < 0.001).
The progression of the quality of life during the trimesters
Of the 23 studies selected, 20 (86,9%) described the
progression of QOL using SF-36 or SF-12 (Figs. 2, 3).
The study of the SF-36 PCS and MCS aggregate
scores revealed that there were significant variations
during the trimesters (Fig. 2).
The PCS values ranged from 48 to 61 during the 1st
trimester; between 39 and 55 during the 2nd trimester;
between 37.5, and 47.5 during the 3rd trimester. For
SF-12, values ranged from 44 to 46 in the 1st trimester,
43 and 50 in the 2nd trimester and 41 and 45 in the 3rd
trimester. The results of the studies indicated a decrease
in physical quality of life throughout pregnancy, particu-
larly related to decreased physical activity and functional
limitations (related to physical health and physical pain).
In terms of prevalence, the Haas et al. study in 2005
showed an increase in pregnant women with poor
physical quality of life during pregnancy: 9% of preg-
nant women in the second trimester, and 13% in the
third trimester [14]. The proportion of pregnant
women reporting generally poor health (score O to
50) increased from 15.5 to 20.1 and 26.9% and then
decreased to 21% in the postpartum period [49].
The MCS values were as follows for the SF-36: in
the 1st trimester values between a minimum of 51
and a maximum of 58; in the 2nd trimester between
49 and 62; in the 3rd trimester between 49.5 and 66.
In parallel with SF-12, the MCS was between 47 and
48 in the first trimester, between 49 and 52 in the
second trimester and 50 and 54 in the third trimester.
In five studies, the quality of mental life of the preg-
nant women increased or remained stable over the
course of the trimesters (Fig. 2).
The evolution of the 8 dimensions of SF-36 during the
quarters is presented in Fig. 3. The following domains
had the lowest scores: role limitations due to physical
problems (RP) and vitality (VT). The following domains
had the highest scores: general health perceptions (GH)
and bodily pain (BP). The results concerning the role
limitations due to emotional problems (RE) varied across
studies.

Factors influencing quality of life
(2018) 18:455
The results of studies on the factors associated with the
quality of life of pregnant women are presented in Ta-
bles 2 and 3. Thirty-three articles were selected for this
section.
Socio-demographic factors
The following socio-demographic factors were strongly
associated with a better quality of life in 15 studies:
mean maternal age, primiparity, early gestational age,
the absence of economic problems, a high educational
level, being employed, being married, having family and
friends. With less consensus, belonging to an ethnic mi-
nority and alcohol consumption have also been associ-
ated in 2 studies with a poorer quality of life.
Physical factors
Medically assisted reproduction, obstetric complications,
medical history, possible hospitalisation and obesity were
factors frequently indicating a poor quality of life during
pregnancy (in 9 studies). Physical symptoms associated
with pregnancy such as nausea and vomiting, epigastral-
gia, reflux, shortness of breath, dizziness, back pain and
sleep problems affected women's quality of life. Exercise
was a factor that improved the quality of life of pregnant
women. With less consensus, we found other factors as-
sociated with a poorer QOL such as smoking during the
months prior to conception, a history of alcohol depend-
ence and poor comfort.
Psychological factors
Eight studies have shown that symptoms of depression,
anxiety, and stress were factors that had a strong nega-
tive impact on the quality of life of pregnant women.
Sexual and domestic violence was linked to a lower
quality of life, as well as the experience of
life-threatening events and the experience of infertility.
Happiness at being pregnant and being optimistic were
factors related to a better quality of life.
Discussion
Summary of results
Pregnant women, especially during the third trimester,
had significantly lower quality of life scores than
non-pregnant women of the same age. Physically, the
quality of life decreased significantly during the course
of the trimesters. On a psychological level, several stud-
ies reported an increase in quality of life relative to men-
tal health during pregnancy, and in others psychological
stability was seen. Many factors were associated with the
quality of life in pregnant women. Some factors associ-
ated with higher well-being were socio-demographic
(first-time pregnancy, a favourable socio-economic sta-
tus, social support, partner support). Similarly, the desire
Page 8 of 14
to be pregnant and moderate physical activity were fac-
tors associated with a positive quality of life. A lesser
quality of life was attributed to physical factors, (such as
complications during pregnancy, medically assisted
reproduction, obesity prior to conception, physical
symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, sleep difficul-
ties), and otherwise attributed to psychological factors,
(such as anxiety and stress during pregnancy and de-
pressive symptoms).
Strengths and limitations of the study
To our knowledge, this is the only systematic review of
international literature aimed at synthesizing data re-
garding the quality of life of pregnant women. Many fac-
tors have been studied, considering the different
dimensions of the quality of life, for pregnant women in
general good health. This work also has its limitations:
the research only included articles written in English or
French. Therefore, the issue of generalizability should be
discussed. In addition, two other articles could not be
read in their entirety. Within the selected studies, few
studies were multi-centric and only one study used in-
formation from a large national survey. In addition, we
found a high degree of heterogeneity in the methodology
for population selection, in choosing the quality of life
scale, as well as in the results presented (dimensions of
SF-36, composite scores, etc) complicating the synthesis
study. Specific HRQOL questionnaires were not in-
cluded because they are focused more on specific prob-
lems in pregnancy (such as nausea and vomiting) rather
than on women's overall well-being and their quality of
life. With regard to the quality of these studies, three
studies did not explicitly take into account the con-
founding factors in the presentation of the results [22,
38, 47], which may lead to confusion bias. In addition, a
large number of studies were cross-sectional. These
studies did not establish an associative cause-and-effect
relationship.
Research and policy implications
In some countries, the quality of life of pregnant woman
has been little studied. In France, for example, only one
study provided information on pregnant women
well-being [6] (study not included in our analysis — cf.
exclusion criteria). In this study, the mental health of
pregnant women was measured through the following
question: "On a psychological level, how did you feel
during your pregnancy? Well, Quite well, Quite poor,
Poor". Of the 14,326 women interviewed, 8.9% reported
poor self-rated mental health during pregnancy. More-
over, sociodemographic characteristics indicative of so-
Cial disadvantage were associated with a higher-risk of
poor quality of life; sometimes, a social gradient was ob-
served. [6, 52]. Since SF-36 is a generic scale, it allows

Key Results
Women who had experienced sexual violence had significantly lower PCS and
MCS (PCS 42.2, SD = 5.3 and MCS 37.4, SD-I .2) than women who had no
history of sexual violence (PCS 511), 7.5 and MCS 48.1, 0.2, p < 0.001).
PW without symptoms of NVP: PCS: 67.92; MCS 68.36; PW with moderate
symptoms: PCS: 56.93; MCS 60.86; PW with severe symptoms: PCS: 5001; MCS:
50.23
The variations between the PCS and MCS of the 3 groups are all significant. (P
< 0.01). All QO dimensions are affected by NVP (p < 0.05)
Factors associated with PCS: Pregnancy stage (beta =
- 7.79, p < 0.001),
experience of infertility (beta = —
6.39, 0.03).
Factors associated with MCS: stage of pregnancy (beta = 3.31, p < 0.001),
number of pregnancies (beta = — 7.12, p = 0.01), medical condition beta = — 4.08,
p = 0.04).
Factors associated with overall QOL: Pregnancy stage (beta =
I .64, p = 0.01),
desired pregnancy (beta = 5.52, p = 0.04), medical condition (beta = .
-529,
0.001).
No significant difference between PBP and NBP in the different areas of WHO-
QO -BREF: physical health p = 0.229; psychological hea th p= 0.069; Social rela-
tionship p = 0.125; Environment p = 0.790
Multivariable analysis: Sleep problems affected most QOL components (PF: b =
- 0.17, p < 0.007; PR: -0,19, p = 0.002; BP: -0,35, p < 0.0001; GH:
0.2 ; VT: b--0.25, p<0.ooo ; SF: 5=-0.26, p<0.ooo , MH:
0.20, p < 0.000
A depressive mood was an independent determinant in 6/9 of the QOL
dimensions (BP: b=
-O. 3, 0,.039, GI-I: 5=-0.28, p < 0.000 , VT: 5=-040, p
< 0.0001, SF 0.27, p < 0.0001; ER: b 0.50, p < 0.0001, MH: - 0.59, p <
0.0001), and anxiety also affected physical activity and limitations due to
physical state.
The life experience of the past year had a negative impact on physical activity,
social functioning and mental health scores. Having complications during
pregnancy affected physical activity and social functioning. Age, professional
status, educational level and medical problems were linked to on y one
parameter of SF36.
Epigastralgia: significant decrease in PR (p = 0.009) and of SF (p= 0.020); RGO:
significant decrease in PR (p= 0.004) and of ER (p= 0.002)
PW having a medical y assisted pregnancy: PCS: 40.0 then 35.97; MCS: 52.32
then 53.02; PW having conceived spontaneously: PCS: 44.78; then 38.86. MCS:
51.08 then 53.65
Physical well-being scores significantly lower in the medically assisted preg-
nancy group than in the spontaneous conception group (P = 0.033) in the cat-
egories: physical health limitations, vitality, social functioning. Physical well-
being scores of PW with medically assisted pregnancy decreased during preg-
nancy, more significantly than spontaneously conceived PW (P = 0.008)
Low social support was statistically associated with a reduced QO (For PCS: F =
1.53, P < 0.001, For MCS: F = 90.60, P < 0.001). On the contrary, the group where
social support was high had better QOL. (P < 0.001)
Social support: beta = 0.21 [—0.04,0.47] was not significant during pregnancy
PW between 25 and 29 years of age had a better RF, PR, BP than the others (PF:
1.07 P=O.OOI; PR: BP: I .O p=O.OOl)
Caucasian and Asian PW had higher SF and MH scores than other ethnic
groups (S F = 2.65, p = 0.02; MH: F = 2.42 0.03)
Single PW had higher SF and MH scores than other ethnic groups (SF: F = 2.65,
p = 0.02; MH: F = 2.42 0.03)
A significant relationship is found between the different components of SF12
and maternal stress except for BP (PH r — —
- 3.87; PR 7.79; BP: 7.79; GI-I:

comparisons with chronic pathologies such as diabetes.
The results obtained concerning physical activity and
pain in pregnant women can be compared to those ob-
tained for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular dis-
eases, diabetes and cancer [18]. A study by Sprangers et
al. in 2000 found an average value of 58 in the "Physical
Functions" and 64 in the "Bodily Pain" categories con-
cerning diabetic patients [53]. In comparison, we found
values between 53 and 77 for "Physical Functions" and
between 48 and 74 for "Bodily Pain" in pregnant women.
Moreover, quality of life refers to subjective elements
that may vary from one culture to another. In the Coban
et al. study undertaken in three countries over three
continents: China, Ghana, USA [25], the subjective con-
cepts of "well-being" or "vitality" were perceived and
measured in very different ways on the three continents.
This study did not focus on the quality of life of fathers.
According to the Abassi et al. study, the quality of life of
fathers was significantly higher during pregnancy and
postpartum than that of their partner [39]. Specifically,
their physical quality of life was significantly higher.
Their mental quality of life was close, and there was no
significant difference between them and their partner in
two studies where this was studied [41, 43]. Finally, we
believe that it is necessary to systematically screen
women having a poor quality of life during pregnancy.
Studies have to determine whether a single question is
sufficient in clinical practice or whether it is preferable
to have a more specific questionnaire before the
follow-up consultation.
Conclusions
Health-related quality of life refers to the subjective as-
sessment of patients regarding the physical, mental and
social dimensions of well-being. Women's subjective per-
ception of their health-related quality of life is an essen-
tial measure of the quality and effectiveness of maternal
and child health interventions. However, few women
(less than 20%) speak spontaneously about their
psychological ill-health to a health professional. Health
authorities' recommendations are needed to better de-
tect a poor quality of life of pregnant women and to
evaluate the impact of care in terms of quality of life of
pregnant women. Then, given the diversity of factors as-
sociated with the quality of life, the medical and para-
medical professions need to work in cohesion with
social agencies, networks, and associations.

of severe maternal morbidity

BACKGROUND: Both obesity and excessive gestational weight gain
are associated with severe maternal morbidity, but there is limited litera-
ture evaluating whether the risk of severe maternal morbidity is further
increased by the degree or severity of excessive gestational weight gain.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether pregnant patients
with excessive gestational weight gain who gained more than 50 lb were
at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity compared with those who
only moderately exceeded recommended gestational weight gain guide-
lines. A secondary objective was to determine whether patients who
gained 10 lb more than the recommended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy body mass index group were at increased risk of
severe maternal morbidity compared with those who exceeded that upper
limit by a lesser amount.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients
with live, term, singleton deliveries with excessive gestational weight gain
from 7 hospitals within a large health system in New York between Janu-
ary 2019 and February 2020. Excessive gestational weight gain was
defined as exceeding the recommended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy body mass index category using the National
Academy of Medicine gestational weight gain guidelines: lb for a
body mass index of < 18.5 kg/m2, >35 lb for a body mass index of 18.5
to 24.9 kg/m2, >25 lb for a body mass index of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2, and
lb for a body mass index of 330.0 kg/m2. Patient height and weight
data were self-repotted at the time of delivery hospitalization and retrieved
from the electronic medical record system. Patients were classified into 2
excessive gestational weight gain groups: moderate (<50 lb) or severe
(>50 lb). Patients with missing body mass index or gestational weight
gain were excluded. The primary exposure was severe excessive gesta-
tional weight gain. The primary outcome was severe maternal morbidity,
defined using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria.
Logistic regression was used to model the likelihood of severe maternal
morbidity, adjusting for race and ethnicity, nulliparity, advanced maternal
age, gestational diabetes mellitus, and maternal mood disorder. For the
secondary analysis, severe maternal morbidity rates were compared
between patients who exceeded their body mass index—specific upper
limit of total weight gain by 210 lb and those who exceeded it by lb.
RESULTS: A total of 11 ,506 patients were included for analysis, and
1 965 patients (17.1 %) had severe excessive gestational weight gain. The
overall rate of severe maternal morbidity was 3.3%. Severe maternal mor-
bidity occurred in 85 of 1 965 patients (4.3%) with severe excessive gesta-
tional weight gain and 292 of 9541 patients (3.1%) with moderate
excessive gestational weight gain. On regression analysis, after adjust-
ment for covariate factors, patients with a severe excessive gestational
weight gain were 39% more likely to experience severe maternal morbidity
than those with moderate excessive gestational weight gain (adjusted odds
ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.08—1.79). Patients with excessive
gestational weight gain of 210 lb above the recommended body mass
index—specific upper limit for gestational weight gain were 32% more
likely (adjusted odds ratio, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.07—1.62) to
experience severe maternal morbidity than patients who exceeded that
upper limit by lb.
CONCLUSION: Patients with live, term, singleton pregnancies who
gain more than 50 lb are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity
compared with those who only moderately exceed gestational weight gain
guidelines. Similarly, patients who gain 210 lb above the recommended
body mass index—specific upper limit for gestational weight gain are at
increased risk. Further study is warranted to determine the most effective
intetwentions to manage gestational weight gain and mitigate maternal
risk.

with more maternal comorbidities.
Obesity is the most common comorbid-
ity in reproductive-age women, and it is
a known risk factor for several other
medical comorbidities. According to the
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC), 30% of pregnant women in
the United States are obese before preg-
nancy. There is a well-established asso-
ciation between obesity and SMM.56 In
addition, previous studies have demon-
strated that pregnant patients who
exceed gestational weight gain (GWG)
guidelines are at increased risk of SMM
compared with those who do not.
However, based on our review of the lit-
erature, few studies have evaluated
whether the risk of SMM is further
increased by the degree or severity of
excessive GWG (EGWG).9
The most widely accepted GWG
guidelines are those published in 2009
by the Institute of Medicine (10M),
now known as the National Academy of
Medicine. Recommendations are pro-
vided on the basis of prepregnancy
10
body mass index (BMI) classification.
Thus, EGWG is not defined by a single
threshold but rather by specific criteria
for each BMI group. For singleton

Why was this study conducted?
Previous studies have shown that pregnant patients who exceed gestational
weight gain (GWG) guidelines are at increased risk of severe maternal morbidity
(SMM) compared with those who do not. However, based on our review of the
literature, few studies have evaluated whether the risk of SMM is further
increased by the degree or severity of excessive GWG (EGWG).
Key findings
In this retrospective cohort study of 11,506 patients with EGWG, those who
gained >50 lb (severe EGWG) were 39% more likely to experience SMM than
those who gained lb (moderate EGWG) after adjustment for covariate fac-
tors (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.08—1.79).
What does this add to what is known?
Among pregnancies affected by EGWG, the degree or severity of EGWG is posi-
tively associated with a risk of SMM.
pregnancies, the upper limits of recom-
mended GWG vary from 20 to 40 lb for
patients with obesity (BMI of 330 kg/
m2) and patients who are underweight
(BMI of < 18.5 kg/m2), respectively.
This study aimed to evaluate how the
severity of EGWG is associated with
SMM. To provide more interpretable
and generalizable information, we
assessed an arbitrary threshold of exces-
siveness that could be applied across all
BMI groups, one that was 10 lb above
the upper limit of the highest recom-
mended GWG of any prepregnancy
BMI group in the 10M guidelines (ie,
40 lb for women who are underweight).
Specifically, our primary objective was
to determine whether pregnant patients
who gain more than 50 lb (severe
EGWG) are at higher risk of SMM than
those who only moderately exceed rec-
ommended guidelines lb). We
hypothesized that patients who gained
more than 50 lb would be at increased
risk of SMM compared with those who
did not. A secondary objective was to
determine whether patients who gained
10 lb more than the recommended
upper limit of total weight gain for a
given BMI group were at increased risk
of SMM compared with those who
exceeded that upper limit but by < 10 lb.
Materials and Methods
This retrospective cohort study evalu-
ated all patients with live, singleton,
term deliveries with EGWG from 7
2 AJOG MFM January 2024
hospitals within a large health system in
New York between January 2019 and
February 2020. A term delivery was
defined as occurring between 37 0/7
and 41 6/7 weeks of gestation. EGWG
was defined as exceeding the recom-
mended upper limit of total weight gain
for a given prepregnancy BMI category
using the 10M GWG guidelines: >40 lb
for patients who are underweight (BMI
of <18.5 kg/m2), >35 lb for patients
with a normal weight (BMI of 18.5
—24.9 kg/m2), >25 lb for patients who
are overweight (BMI of 25.0—29.9 kg/
m2), and >20 lb for patients with obe-
sity (BMI of 330.0 kg/m2). Patient
height and weight data were self-
reported at the time of delivery hospital-
ization and retrieved from the electronic
medical record (EMR) system; this
included both prepregnancy and deliv-
ery values. Outpatient prenatal records
were not reviewed for this study because
of inconsistent access and availability.
The study participants were classified
into 2 groups based on the amount of
EGWG: moderate EGWG (<50 1b) or
severe EGWG (>50 lb). Patients with
missing BMI or GWG data were
excluded. Clinical and sociodemo-
graphic data were obtained from the
EMR system (Sunrise Clinical Manager,
Allscripts Corp, Chicago, IL). Maternal
comorbidities were identified from clin-
ical documentation and International
Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modification codes. The
Northwell Health Institutional Review
Board (IRB) approved this study as
minimal-risk research using data col-
lected for routine clinical practice and
waived the requirement for informed
consent (IRB approval number: 21-
0975).
Our primary exposure of interest was
severe EGWG (>50 lb). The primary
outcome was SMM, which was defined
using the 21 indicators outlined by the
).11 The rate
CDC (
Supplemental Table
of SMM was compared between the
moderate and severe EGWG groups.
A secondary analysis was performed,
which considered EGWG concerning
the prepregnancy BMI group. For this
analysis, instead of using 1 cutoff of
>50 lb, the cutoff was 10 lb above the
recommended upper limit of total
weight gain for each prepregnancy BMI
group in the 10M GWG guidelines: 50
lb for a BMI of < 18.5 kg/m2, 45 lb for a
BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, 35 lb for a
BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2, and 30 lb for
a BMI of 330 kg/m2. Particularly, the
rate of SMM was compared between
patients who exceeded their BMI-spe-
cific threshold by 210 lb and those who
exceeded it by a lesser amount.
Demographic and clinical data were
summarized according to exposure arm
using means, standard deviations,
medians, quartiles, and proportions, as
appropriate. For both the primary and
secondary objectives, logistic regression
was used to model the likelihood of
SMM. Variable selection was performed
using the Akaike information criterion
and the backward selection method. All
possible explanatory variables in Table 1
were included in the initial model. The
final regression models for the primary
and secondary analyses were adjusted
for race and ethnicity group, nulliparity,
advanced maternal age, gestational dia-
betes mellitus, and maternal mood dis-
order. In addition, the secondary
analysis was adjusted for public health
insurance. BMI was eliminated from
the final models for both the primary
and secondary analyses. The odds ratios
(ORS) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIS) are presented for each retained
independent variable. The sample size
for this study was based on the

Results
A total of 11,506 patients with EGWG
were included for analysis, and 1965
patients (17.1%) gained more than 50 lb
during pregnancy (Figure 1). Baseline
clinical and demographic characteristics
are summarized in
Table 1.
The study
population was predominantly non-
Hispanic White, was English speaking,
was married, and had private health
insurance. In this cohort study, the
overall rate of SMM was 3.3% (n=377).
SMM occurred in 85 of 1965 patients
(4.3%) with severe EGWG and 292 of
9541 patients (3.1%) with moderate
EGWG (odds ratio [OR], 1.43;
confidence interval [CI], 1.11—1.83;
P=.006).
The results of multivariable logistic
regression are shown in Figure 2. After
adjustment for covariate factors,
patients with a severe EGWG were 39%
more likely (adjusted OR [aOR], 1.39;
95% CI, 1.08—1.79) to experience an
SMM event than those with moderate
EGWG. Prepregnancy BMI was
removed from the model on backward
selection. Weakly positive associations
with SMM (aOR, 1.1—2.0) were noted
for mood disorders (compared with the
absence of this diagnosis), nulliparity
(compared with multiparity), advanced
maternal age (compared with age of
<35 years), and gestational diabetes
mellitus (compared with no diabetes
mellitus). Race and ethnicity group was
the variable most strongly associated
with SMM in this EGWG cohort. Com-
pared with non-Hispanic White
patients, those in all other race and eth-
nicity groups were at increased risk of
SMM (aOR, 1.5—2.3) with the highest
risk seen for non-Hispanic Black
patients (aOR, 2.29; 95% CI, 1.71
—3.06).
Although the frequency of SMM
was increased in the severe EGWG
group compared with the moderate
EGWG group, there was no individ-
ual category of SMM that differed
Original Research
significantly between the groups
(Table 2). However, 2 SMM indica-
tors (eclampsia and acute respiratory
failure) had borderline significant P
values of .05.
The results of the secondary analysis
are shown in Figure 3. After adjustment
for covariate factors, patients with
EGWG of at least 10 lb more than the
recommended BMI-specific upper limit
for GWG were 32% more likely (aOR,
1.32; 95% CI, 1.07—1.62) to experience
an SMM event than patients who
exceeded that upper limit but by a lesser
amount.
Comment
Principal findings
Among term pregnant patients who
exceeded GWG guidelines, those who
gained more than 50 lb were at
increased risk of SMM compared with
those who gained less weight, consistent
with our hypothesis. In addition,
patients who gained at least 10 lb more
than the recommended BMI-specific
upper limit for GWG were at increased
risk of SMM compared with those with
GWG above that upper limit but < 10
b.
Results in the context of what is
known
Previous studies have investigated
maternal outcomes associated with
EGWG. There is an association between
EGWG and gestational diabetes melli-
tus, hypertensive disorders of preg-
nancy, cesarean delivery, postpartum
weight retention, and long-term mater-
12—14
nal metabolic disorders.
Some
studies have evaluated the association
between EGWG and SMM,7 15 and at
least 1 study has differentiated by sever-
ity of EGWG,9 but none have specifi-
cally evaluated severe EGWG as defined
in this study. By evaluating a uniform
definition of severe EGWG (>50 lb),
one that does not differ by prepreg-
nancy BMI group, our findings may be
more easily interpreted and used for
patient counseling.
Our findings are consistent with the
study by Truong et a19 who reported
that an increased risk of adverse mater-
nal and neonatal outcomes was

associated with a greater degree of
GWG. The authors compared the out-
comes among 4 groups: below, within, 1
to 19 lb above, and 220 lb above 10M
GWG guidelines based on prepreg-
nancy BMI class. Although that study
evaluated some severe maternal out-
comes, it did not comprehensively eval-
15
uate all SMM outcomes. Leonard et al
evaluated the association between
4 AJOG MFM January 2024
GWG and SMM, using the CDC crite-
ria, across each BMI group, and con-
cluded that higher GWG correlated
with increased risk of SMM but with
differential effects based on the prepreg-
nancy BMI group. In our study, we
observed that patients with a GWG of
>50 lb (severe EGWG) were at a higher
risk of SMM than those with a GWG of
lb (moderate EGWG).
Clinical implications
Severe EGWG is a modifiable clinical
risk factor for SMM. Based on our find-
ings, patients with EGWG should
receive counseling about their increased
risk, and early intervention and man-
agement strategies should be imple-
mented to reduce the likelihood of
adverse outcomes. All pregnant patients
should track weight gain, consume bal-
anced diets, avoid highly processed
foods, and engage in moderate-intensity
10
aerobic exercise. Additional strategies
are warranted for patients who exceed
GWG guidelines and for those at the
highest risk of doing so, such as those
16
with mood disorders.
For these
patients at increased risk, nutrition
counseling by registered dietitians may
increase adherence to dietary recom-
mendations.
Research implications
Although SMM was increased in the
group with severe EGWG, we were
unable to detect a difference in the fre-
quency of individual SMM indicators
(eg, blood transfusion) between study
groups. Based on our sample size, it is
not certain whether the increase is
attributable to specific SMM indicators
or increased uniformly across all SMM
indicators. Larger samples or popula-
tion-based studies may provide more
insight. Moreover, it is possible that the
effect of severe EGWG on SMM may be
modified by the presence or absence of
intermediate outcomes. For example,
many, but not all, pregnancies with
severe EGWG will be complicated by
macrosomia; this fetal complication
increases the risk of postpartum hemor-
rhage because of overdistention of the
uterus, which may lead to a blood trans-
fusion, the most common form of
SMM. Mediation analysis can be per-
formed to better understand the under-
lying mechanism or process by which
severe EGWG influences SMM risk.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. The
patient population is diverse, resides in
both urban and suburban communities,
and spans the socioeconomic spectrum.

In addition, our study has several limi-
tations. First, our study had a retrospec-
tive observational study design.
Therefore, we could only establish an
association between severe EGWG and
SMM rather than a direct cause-and-
effect relationship. Second, GWG data
were self-reported at the time of delivery
hospitalization, and there was a risk of
recall bias. Third, our primary outcome
was based on administrative (billing)
data, and there was a risk of erroneous
or inconsistent coding practices. Never-
theless, all data were retrieved from a
shared electronic health record system
that is used across all included hospital
sites, which should have limited misclas-
sification. Finally, our analysis was
restricted to term pregnancies (because
10M guidelines were developed for this
group), which excluded a substantial
portion of SMM. Furthermore, we did

Conclusions
Patients with live, term, singleton preg-
nancies who gain more than 50 lb
throughout pregnancy are at increased
risk of SMM compared with those who
only moderately exceed GWG guide-
lines. Moreover, those who gain 210 lb
above the recommended BMI-specific
upper limit for GWG are more likely to
experience SMM than those who exceed
the guidelines to a lesser degree. Further
study is warranted to determine the
most effective interventions to manage
GWG and mitigate maternal risk.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective: To explore work-arounds at faith-based obstetrics and gynecology residency programs to ac-
complish family planning training.
Study design: We invited educational stakeholders to participate in telephone interviews that elicited
strategies for overcoming barriers to family planning training in religious settings.
Results: Eighteen out of 30 invited programs leaders participated. Work-arounds included reliance on
non-contraceptive indications for contraception and permanent contraception provision, obtaining ethics
committee approvals for service provision, and developing partnerships with offsite centers for training.
Conclusion: Ob-gyn residency programs affiliated with religious hospitals utilize various work-arounds
for family planning training and patient care. These findings may inform other programs that face similar
barriers, secondary to institutional or governmental restrictions.

tion of procreation and that life begins at conception
[1-31.
Recent
evidence demonstrates that non-Catholic faith-based hospitals also
face restrictions to abortion provision
As Roe. v. Wade is now
overturned, many states are facing new regulations to abortion
provision.
The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME) mandates comprehensive family planning education in-
cluding abortion training at all obstetrics and gynecology (ob-
gyn) programs, regardless of institutional filiation, with the abil-
ity of individual residents to opt-out based on personal or moral

Catholic sites, have historically faced the challenge of providing
comprehensive family planning training while adhering to institu-
tional guidelines. In this study, we sought to explore the barriers
that program leaders face, and the strategies used to accomplish
comprehensive family planning training at faith-based hospitals in
the form of work-arounds.
2. Materials and methods
We previously identified 30 ob-gyn residency programs in
which at least 70% of resident time was spent at a Catholic or
other faith-based hospital that prohibited reproductive services
and invited them to participate in an online survey study
[41.
These programs accounted for 11% of the 278 ACGME accredited
ob-gyn residency programs in 2017-18 and are responsible for
approximately 120 graduating residents each year. In this study,
the senior author invited the 25 educational stakeholders (mainly
program directors) who responded to the original online survey
and expressed a willingness to participate in a follow-up 30 to
60-minute telephone interview. We offered a $100 gift card as
remuneration.
Our telephone interviews explored onsite strategies, offsite col-
laborations, ongoing barriers, and respondents' understanding of
institutional and educational requirements. The senior investiga-
tor (MG) conducted all interviews, informed survey respondents
that participation was voluntary and any personal or institutional

names would be deidentified during analysis. After full disclosures,
we obtained oral consent. We chose to write notes rather than
audio-record given the sensitive nature of this study and partici-
pant concerns for employment repercussions.
To identify common work-arounds and strategies, 2 investiga-
tors performed directed content analysis of interview notes. We
received exemption approval from the Colorado Multiple Institu-
tional Review Board based on the deidentified nature, minimal risk
to participants and exclusion of personal health information.
3. Results
Eighteen of the 30 (60%) ob-gyn program leaders that primarily
train residents at a religious hospital completed the telephone in-
terview; 13 of the participants (72%) were based at Catholic sites.
Respondents included 16 program directors (89%), one department
chair and one faculty attending tasked with family planning ed-
ucation. Seventeen interviews occurred between March 2017 and
November 2017 with one additional in April 2018. We considered
a lack of response to the interview invitation correspondence as
refusal to participate in the study.
Many participants used online trainings and simulation for fam-
ily planning procedures for contraception, permanent contracep-
tion, and abortion care. Table 1
presents key findings of the work-
arounds reported by interviewed stakeholders, organized by fam-
ily planning method. We did not detect contraception or perma-
nent contraception training concerns among the eight non-Catholic
faith-based programs during interviews. Respondents who previ-
ously received Residency Review Committee (RCC) citations for in-
adequate training explained how these citations were helpful as
they often provided leverage to improve training.
4. Discussion
We found varying ways in which religious ob-gyn residency
programs accomplished family planning training. The extent to
which contraception and permanent contraception provision oc-
curred onsite at Catholic facilities was often dependent on lo-
cal interpretations of the directives and acceptance of work-
arounds. Regarding abortion training, offsite collaborations were
most often employed as suffcient onsite training was not possi-
ble at all the religious hospital sites. Local factors including fac-
ulty leaders, state settings, and malpractice concerns, served as
modifiers to how feasible or successful community partnerships
occurred
[61.
In recent years, 73% of all U.S. ob-gyn residency program di-
rectors have cited some sort of institutional or governmental re-
striction that interferes with abortion training [7 . With the fall
of Roe, 26 states may ban abortion, potentially eliminating train-
ing for almost half of U.S. ob-gyn residency programs (45%)
181.
This will cause a detrimental impact on the training of 2638 of
the 6007 total ob-gyn residents in the U.S.
To continue com-
prehensive training of future ob-gyn physicians, educational lead-
ers will have to prepare for a changing and more restrictive envi-
ronment. Strategies employed by our respondents may guide such
ob-gyn programs and those at religious settings that are transition-
ing from osteopathic to ACGME accreditation status. Our work may
also aid residency programs of other specialties that train physi-
cians in family planning services including family medicine, inter-
nal medicine and pediatrics.
Due to the nature of an interview study, our findings were
limited by participation bias. It is possible that respondents were
more likely to have strong opinions about abortion training in their
programs than those who did not participate. We deliberately took
notes instead of audio recordings so that respondents would feel

Table 1
Family planning work-arounds reported by program leaders at re-
ligious ob-gyn residency programs in the United States between
2017and 2018
Contraception
• Liberal use/exaggeration of non-contraceptive
indications for onsite provision
• Vague documentation of contraceptive need
• Offsite collaborations with community health centers
• Varying contractual agreements that influenced
provision of contraceptives onsite (e.g. private
ownership of health centers where residents received
reproductive care training)
• Employment of residents as state employees who are
not bound by institutional directives
• Hospital acquisition by larger religious health care
system that allowed additional contraceptive
provisions based on local interpretation of directives
Permanent Contraception
• Approval under rationale of risk reducing surgery
(age >35 years old, BRCA carriers) as a
non-contraceptive indication, some cited this fulfilled
the "double effect" principle
• Approval by ethics committee for tubal ligation at
time of cesarean section for patients deemed
high-risk (high number of prior cesarean sections,
pulmonary or cardiac disease)
• Referral of patients to offsite surgical centers (other
non-restrictive hospitals or outpatient centers) that
had training agreements
• Approval when tubal ligation is performed at time of
laparoscopy for other indications (i.e. ovarian
cystectomy)
Abortion
• Approval for onsite abortion if threat to maternal life
or lethal fetal anomalies
• Multidisciplinary collaborations with maternal fetal
medicine representatives and the ethics committee
helped gain approvals for onsite abortion
• Induction of labor permitted over D&E based on
interpretation of this method as an "indirect
abortion"
Program agreements with free standing health
centers or other centers that provide abortion care,
sometimes residents were considered "volunteers" at
offsite clinics to gain training approval
• Assistance from the Kenneth J. Ryan Residency
Training Program in Abortion and Family Planning
cited as helpful.
1 Work-arounds grouped by family planning service and re-
ported in order of most common to least common
more comfortable sharing their insights, however some informa-
tion is inevitably lost with handwritten notes. Additionally, we pre-
sented primarily qualitative over quantitative data to provide the
most insight and guidance for future application. Strengths of our
study include that the interviews were open-ended, both first and
senior authors trained and worked in a religious setting so were
knowledgeable on the topic, and the senior author conducted all
interviews for consistency.
The extent to which religious programs employed work-arounds
reduced the need to seek offsite collaborations. While this resulted
in improved training experiences, this finding reemphasizes the
moral and clinical ambiguities that occur when Catholic programs
attempt to balance the directives and accreditation requirements
simultaneously [9 . These findings also highlight the varying de-
grees to which Catholic hospitals follow the directives and the im-
pact this has on both patient care and resident training [2,3]. These
findings demonstrate the many educational and ethical dilemmas

that arise as when essential health care services are increasingly
restricted by institutional or governmental bodies.

BACKGROUND: The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine uses social
media to increase awareness of the Society and its key programs and to
foster community and discussion around perinatal health, especially on
Twitter. The influence and role of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
Twitter account in public discourse around issues relevant to pregnancy
have not been studied.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the trends in engagement
with the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine on Twitter by analyzing Soci-
ety for Maternal-Fetal Medicine follower growth and discussion topics on
Twitter compared with Facebook and by quantifying public engagement
during the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective study analyzed follower growth data
from August 2019 to July 2022 for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
Twitter (@MySMFM) and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Facebook
(@SocietyforMaternalFetalMedicine) accounts. We identified the top 10
tweets and Facebook posts during the study period using Twitter Analytics
and Facebook data. The popularity of tweets and Facebook posts was deter-
mined by "impressions" and "reach," respectively; these metrics reflect the
number of times a post was viewed. To evaluate annual trends in Society
for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter engagement, we analyzed data associ-
ated with the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meet-
ing, including the number of tweets using the hashtag (#SMFM(Year)) and
overall impressions for the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter
RESULTS: The absolute number of new followers for the Society for
Maternal-Fetal Medicine Twitter and Facebook accounts was similar,
but the relative increase and rate of follower growth was higher for
Twitter than for Facebook. The Twitter account consistently gained fol-
lowers, whereas the Facebook account experienced intermittent peri-
ods of stagnancy or follower loss. More than half of the top-ranked
posts on Twitter and Facebook mentioned the COVID-19 vaccine; other
popular topics included COVID-19 and abortion. During the Society for
Maternal-Fetal Medicine Annual Pregnancy Meeting, the number of
tweets using the meeting hashtag consistently peaked on meeting day
4, coincident with the opening plenary session (mean 1270±499). An
upward trend in annual pregnancy meeting tweets was observed each
year until 2021 —the first virtual Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
meeting.
CONCLUSION: The trends in Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
Twitter engagement suggest increasing use and popularity of the platform
for timely dissemination of pregnancy-related news, guidelines, and
research. The reduction in annual pregnancy meeting tweets and impres-
sions in 2021 and 2022 suggests the potential negative effect of villual
meetings on Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine member engagement
around annual meeting content.
Key words: Facebook, maternal-fetal medicine, Society for Maternal-
Fetal Medicine, social media, Tweet, Twitter
account for each meeting from 2016 to 2023.
Introduction
ocial media has emerged as a pri-
S
mary source of information and an
essential strategy for distributing health-
related content. The popularity and ben-
efits of social media use in medicine are
well documented and include rapid dis-

health literacy and healthcare quality,
and increased patient empowerment.

programs; to foster community and dis-
cussion of perinatal health topics among
members, physicians, professional organi-
zations, policymakers, and the public; to
share information pertinent to reproduc-
tive healthcare, such as clinical guidelines,
patient safety information, and research;
and to advocate on behalf of the commu-
nities it serves. SMFM and other profes-
sional organizations play an important
role in amplifying accurate information
and messaging that promotes perinatal
and women's health.
Among social media platforms, Twitter
has emerged as a popular platform for
medical discourse and education, out-
growing Facebook and Instagram in
some medical communities. The tweet
character limit facilitates concise commu-
nication and has inspired new formats
for academic discussion, for example,
"tweetorials" (a tutorial comprising a
thread of tweets), Twitter journal club,
2,5—7
and live tweeting from conferences.
In 2009, SMFM created its Twitter
account, @MySMFM, which was recently
ranked the second most influential obstet-
rics and gynecology professional organi-
zation on Twitter (behind the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-
gists).8 An effective social media strategy
is fundamental to advancing the mission
of SMFM; however, the efficacy of social
media efforts to attract wide audiences
and encourage interaction with trending
posts on SMFM social media has not
been analyzed.
This study aimed to assess the value
and effect of SMFM's social media pres-
ence by evaluating follower growth and
top-ranked content for SMFM on Twitter
compared with Facebook. Moreover, this

Why was this study conducted?
The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM) uses social media to increase
awareness of the society, its members, and its key programs. This study aimed to
evaluate the trends in engagement with SMFM on Twitter and Facebook.
Key findings
The SMFM Twitter account following has grown steadily over the past 3 years at
a faster rate than Facebook. COVID-related posts garnered the most engage-
ment on both platforms throughout the study.
What does this add to what is known?
Social media engagement around the SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meeting
increased annually until 2021 and 2022 when the meeting was held virtually.
Our findings suggest that Twitter is an important tool for real-time dissemina-
tion and discussion of pregnancy-related research.
study quantified trends in engagement
with the SMFM around SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting by examining the
usage of the meeting hashtag during the
weeks surrounding the conference. We
predicted that growth in SMFM Twitter
followers would surpass the rate of
growth for Facebook and that the virtual
format of the annual pregnancy meeting
in 2021 and 2022 would result in an
increase in meeting-related tweets.
Materials and Methods
Study design
This descriptive retrospective study
used SMFM Twitter and Facebook
account data (available to account own-
ers) to quantify engagement with the
SMFM on social media. This study was
considered exempt by the institutional
review board of McGovern Medical
School at The University of Texas
Health Science Center at Houston
(approval number: HSC-MS-23-0104).
Twitter and Facebook follower data
Follower growth data from Twitter Ana-
lytics and Facebook Insights between
August 1, 2019, and July 1, 2022 were
analyzed (years for which complete fol-
lower data were available). Twitter Ana-
lytics is an activity dashboard that
provides data on metrics, such as fol-
lower growth, impressions, number of
link clicks, and profile views. We used
the total number of followers on the first
day of each month to extrapolate the
growth rate for each account.
2 AJOG MFM November 2023
Content data
The top 10 SMFM posts on Twitter and
Facebook (January 2019 to July 2022)
were identified using platform-specific
metrics. For Twitter, popular posts were
determined by the number of impres-
sions. Impressions are defined as the
total number of times a tweet appears
10
on a timeline or search result. Post
impressions reflect the level of "expo-
sure" to content, which has been found
to be a more significant predictor of
post influence than the number of likes,
10
comments, or retweets of each post.
For Facebook, top posts were deter-
mined using SMFM's Facebook account
Insights, part of the normal Facebook
analytical data. The posts were ranked
by "reach" or the number of people who
saw the SMFM posts at least once. Simi-
lar to Twitter impressions, Facebook's
reach data reflect exposure to content.
Post categories were determined by
identifying common terms or #hashtags
used in the top-ranked posts for each
platform.
Twitter engagement during the
Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine
Annual Pregnancy Meeting
We quantified SMFM meeting-related
Tweets around the annual pregnancy
meeting to evaluate the level of social
media engagement during a period when
member engagement is anticipated to be
high. 11 We used the social media analyt-
ics platform, Sprout Social, to identify
the number of daily tweets containing
the meeting hashtag ("#SMFMYY" or
"#SMFMYYYY") around the time of the
annual pregnancy meeting for each
meeting from 2016 to 2023. We exam-
ined a 3-week timeframe (from 1 week
before day 1 of the meeting to 1 week
after day 6) to capture the period when
the use of the meeting hashtag is
expected to be the highest. Sprout Social
is a comprehensive social media man-
agement platform that tracks the total
number of tweets, engagements, and
more over time to provide insights into
12
online engagement. To estimate the
audience of the @MySMFM Twitter
account during the same period, we used
Twitter Analytics to collect data on the
total number of @MySMFM tweet
impressions. We compared these data
with the total volume of meeting-related
tweets, collected via Sprout Social, during
the same period.
Data analysis and statistics
Trends in follower growth were deter-
mined using a linear regression model,
and the slopes for Twitter and Facebook
growth from 2019 to 2022 were com-
pared. The number of SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting—related tweets was
calculated for each day of the confer-
ence from 2016 to 2023. To determine
trends in Twitter activity, we compared
the total number of tweets and impres-
sions from day 1 to day 6 of the annual
pregnancy meeting for each year. The
total number of impressions was nor-
malized to the total number of tweets
given an expected proportional relation-
ship between the 2 variables. Data
were analyzed using GraphPad Prism
(version 9.5.1; GraphPad Software, La
Jolla, CA).
Results
At the beginning of the study period,
the SMFM Twitter account had 12,777
followers, whereas the Facebook
account had 22,169 followers. Between
August 2019 and July 2022, the number
of followers gained was slightly higher
for Twitter (10,193 for Twitter vs 9005
for Facebook). This growth translated
to a relative increase of 80% for Twitter
followers compared with 70% for Face-
book followers, although the Facebook


account had more followers overall
(30,600 for Facebook vs 22,739 for
Twitter). The rate of follower growth
was higher for Twitter (slope: 3.4 for
Twitter vs 2.8 for Facebook) (Figure I
Although Twitter followers increased
continuously for the entire study period,
Facebook follower growth varied. Sur-
prisingly, the Facebook page experi-
enced a net loss of 18 followers during 1
month (November 2021). By compari-
son, SMFM society membership grew
18% from January 2020 to January
13
2022.
To identify the content that garnered
the most attention and engagement on
SMFM Twitter and Facebook, we ana-
lyzed the top 10 posts on each platform.
The most popular SMFM Twitter and
Facebook discussion topics were related
to the COVID-19 pandemic (Table).
The topics identified were: COVID-19
vaccines, COVID-19, abortion, and
other (all posts that did not fit into the
other 3 categories). COVID-19 or the
COVID-19 vaccine were the focus of 6
of the top 10 tweets and 8 of the top 10
Facebook posts.
Next, we evaluated social media
engagement around the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting. Tweets using the
SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meeting
hashtag increased between days 1 and 4
(peak) and were the highest on days 4
and 5, corresponding to the main ple-
nary sessions (Figure 2, A). On average,
there was almost a 7-fold increase in
meeting-related tweets between days 1
FIGURE 1
and 4 (eg, during the SMFM 2020
Annual Pregnancy Meeting, there were
458 tweets on day 1 compared with
2295 tweets on day 4, representing a 5-
fold increase in tweets). The number of
daily tweets during the meeting
increased markedly in 2020 compared
with 2019 (2295 vs 1462 on day 4) but
then decreased in 2021 (n=881)—the
first meeting ever held virtually because
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Day 4
tweet volume increased in 2022
(n=1150, virtual meeting) and 2023
(n=1549, in-person meeting) but did
not recover to 2020 levels.
Contrary to our hypothesis that the
virtual meeting format would increase
social media use, approximately half as
many total meeting-related tweets were
posted during the SMFM 2021 Annual
Pregnancy Meeting compared with the
SMFM 2020 Annual Pregnancy Meet-
ing (4348 vs 8555, respectively). Despite
the drop in tweet volume in 2021, over-
all impressions that year were higher
(606,000 vs 347,2000 in 2020) (
Figure 2,
B). This finding reflects the multiple
variables that affect impressions, such
as number of retweets, likes, and com-
ments, and who is engaging with the
content. In 2022 (the second virtual
meeting) and 2023 (in-person meeting),
there was a slight increase in the volume
of meeting-related tweets (4472 and
4714, respectively). By comparison, the
SMFM Annual Pregnancy Meeting
attendance increased from 2500 in 2018
to 2800 in 2019 but then declined each

2021, and 2207 in 2022) until 2023
when attendance peaked at 3108 for the
first in-person meeting since the pan-
demic. Thus, social media engagement
did not correlate directly with meeting
registration.
Comment
Principal findings
Our study evaluated trends in SMFM
social media growth and engagement
using Twitter and Facebook data. We
found that (1) SMFM Twitter follower
growth has surpassed Facebook follower
growth in recent years, (2) the most
popular content on both platforms
mentioned the COVID-19 vaccine or
other COVID-19—related topics, and
(3) tweets during the SMFM Annual
Pregnancy Meeting increased annually
until the shift to a virtual meeting for-
mat in 2021.
Results in the context of what is
known
The finding that SMFM Twitter growth
has surpassed SMFM Facebook growth
since 2019 is not unexpected given the
ever-changing landscape of social media
and the influence of demographic dif-
ferences on platform preference and
14
usage. Fluctuations in the popularity
of different social media platforms are
inevitable; thus, staying up to date with
social media trends is an important
component of an effective communica-
tions strategy.
Our observation that COVID-19 vac-
cine— and disease-related posts were
the most shared and seen content on
both platforms is evidence that social
media can effectively amplify crucial
and timely health information. A recent
analysis of COVID-19—related Twitter
discussions found that, of 3 message
functions (information, community,
and action), engagement through
retweets was most common with Tweets
15
that promoted action. This trend was
also seen in the SMFM Twitter account,
as the most popular tweet encouraged
pregnant people to get vaccinated. In
addition, the social isolation of the pan-
demic increased reliance on social
media updates as a primary news

in tweet volume. Previous studies suggest
many factors can lead to decreased
participant engagement during virtual
meetings, including decreased account-
ability, increased temptation to multi-
task, and overall diminished sense of

ABSTRACT
Background: India has around 25% high-risk pregnant mothers, which leads to about 75% perinatal morbidities.(l) The early prediction
of a high-risk pregnancy and planning interventions can help in preventing complications and result in good pregnancy outcomes.
Aims: To study the pregnancy outcome among the high-risk pregnant women of a rural area and to associate pregnancy outcomes
of high-risk pregnant women with modified Coopland's criteria. Material and Methods: Study design: I-year Longitudinal study
from 2016 to 2017, Study population: The high-risk pregnant women attending PMSMA camp, Study area: Kinaye, Primary Health
Centre, Belagavi. Sample size: 147, Data collection was done using a pretested predesigned questionnaire after obtaimng patient
consent and ethical clearance. Chi-square test was used to study the association of variables and categorical data presented as
percentages. Results: Among the participants, 40.4% of the pregnant women had low-risk scores; 45.9% had high-risk scores, and
13.7% had severe-risk scores according to Coopland's high-risk pregnancy scoring. Nearly 29.5% high-risk pregnancies resulted in
bad fetal outcomes. As Coopland's score in the high-risk group increased, the chance of having good fetal outcomes decreased,
and this association was found to be statistically significant. Conclusions: 70.5% of the high-risk mothers had good pregnancy
outcomes. The scoring system can be used by health workers for the prediction of high-risk pregnancy and plan treatment and
preventive measures.
Keywords: Belagavi, High risk, PMSMA, pregnancy outcome
Introduction
"High-risk pregnancy (H R P) is defined as one which is
complicated by factor or factors that adversely affect the
pregnancy outcome (maternal, perinatal or both)' '[1] Identification
of such pregnancies which lead to poor outcome is the primary
aim in antenatal care. A risk scoring system is very useful for
the detection of HRP as it often results in a bad maternal
and fetal outcome, and extra care should be given, especially

in developing countries like India. Early prediction of such a
state, severity, and planning interventions can help in preventing
complications and thus reduce the maternal and infant mortality
rates and the incidence of low birth weight babies. The Ministry
of Health and Family Welfare of India launched the Pradhan
Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan (PMSMA) in 2016 to provide
quality antenatal care services, free of cost, to all women in their
2nd or 3rd trimesters of pregnancy at certain government health
facilities on the 9th of every month.[21 This helps us in identifying
and tracking high-risk pregnancies, monthly antenatal checkups
by a specialist, and treatment of complicated cases at all the
health centres, thereby making the antenatal services more
approachable to all the pregnant women in all places, including
the remote areas and rural places; thus helping every mother
and child to have a safe delivery and healthy life by preventing

Regarding pregnancy outcome, there were total of 145 newborns
(three abortions and two twin deliveries), among whom 77 (53.1 %)
were male, and 68 (46.9%) were female. The mode of delivery was
normal vaginal for 95 (65.10/0) pregnant women and Caesarean for
51 (34.9%). Most (93 (63.7%)) of the mothers preferred private
hospitals for delivery, whereas 52 (35.6%) preferred Government
hospitals, and one (0.7%) of them had home delivery.
Comparison of pregnancy outcome, 103 (70.5%) of the high
risk pregnancies had good a fetal outcome, and 43 (29.5%) had
bad outcomes.
Full-term vaginal delivery with single live birth with an immediate
cry and normal weight, without complications was considered
a good outcome. There were 43 total bad fetal outcomes as
shown in Figure 2.
The majority of the good fetal outcomes (48 (81.4%))
were seen in the low-risk group, followed by the high-risk
44 (65.7%). The association between the pregnancy risk
group and the fetal outcome was found to be statistically
significant (P = 0.04). [Table 3]
Various steps were taken by the health workers to identify
at-risk pregnant mothers and provide timely, adequate treatment
affecting the overall pregnancy outcome. Some of the preventive
practices are as shown in Figure 3.
Discussion
In the present study, the majority (81.6%) of the mothers were in
the age group of 20 to 29 years, < 19 years were 6.8%, 1 (0.7%)
of the participant was the elderly primigravida. In a similar study
conducted in central India, among 415 women, the majority of
the mothers were in the age group of 19 to 34 years (97.4%), while
the remaining 2.6% were in the age group of < 18 or >35 years.[41
In another study done in Nagpur, 141 (65.89%) were in the age
group of 21 to 25 years, and 14 (6.54%) were teenagers.151 In
our study, 3.4% of the study participants had child marriage,
and nearly 23% of the mothers were aged below 19 years at the
time of the ISt pregnancy. In a similar study of Belagavi, more
than 50% of the participants had child marriage, and 27% of
their age at first pregnancy was <19 years.lll According to the
National Family Health Survey (NFHS) 4 (2015-2016), 26.8%
of the women population have child marriage, and 7.9% of the
pregnancies are <19 years.[61 In this study, 33.4% of the study
participant belonged to the class IV socioeconomic status,
followed by 29.90/0 class III, and only 2.7% belonged to the
Table 3: Coopland's risk scoring and pregnancy outcome
class I, whereas in another study conducted in Kinaye, about
40% belonged to IV socioeconomic class followed by III 39.66%,
and least belonged to class 1 3.66%, according to modified B.G.
Prasad's classification[ll In the present study, around 97.3% of
the mothers were literate. A similar study done in a rural area of
Nagpur showed that (96.73%) were literate.[51
In our study, 47.6% of the women had a normal BMI, 17 (11.6%)
were underweight, 25 (17.0%) overweight, 28 (19.0%) preobese,

Toward Better
Treatment for Women's
Reproductive Health
Ithough women and men share many similar health
challenges throughout their lifetimes, women are not
necessarily healthier. Some conditions that only wom-
en experience—such as pregnancy, ovarian cancer,
or the abnormal growth of the uterus called endome-
triosis—can become great health risks. HIV, AIDS,

and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are also serious
medical and social issues for women worldwide. And because a
woman's reproductive system is complex and delicate—which
makes it particularly vulnerable to dysfunction or disease—
finding ways to treat conditions that take root in the reproduc-
tive tract often prove challenging.
However, in recent years, researchers have been investigat-
ing and developing new ways to administer medications for a
range of women's health conditions. These new methods aim to

causes a number of side effects, but the researchers hoped their
approach would prevent this altogether. In tissue culture, they
were able to successfully guide the sperm using a magnet toward
the tumor, where they then freed the sperm cells to deliver the
drug locally (Figure 6).
While these experiments are still being performed in the lab,
Medina-Sånchez believes that it would eventually be possible to
deliver these types of engineered therapies to patients. She and
her colleagues are still improving how the sperm is guided to
the target tissues. In practice, a patient's physician or another
medical expert would be responsible for guiding the sperm. And,
because it's conceivable that the sperm could perform its natu-
ral function and fuse with oocytes, Medina-Sånchez believes it
would be possible to treat a woman when she's not ovulating.
Looking forward, she and her colleagues are hoping to use the
same robotic sperm technology to treat ectopic pregnancies and
abnormalities in the epithelium of the uterus.
Although it's currently unknown which technologies and
methods of drug delivery will be approved and widely used in the
future, researchers are investigating myriad methods. "Women
like options," says Rohan. "Even if we think about contraception:
not everyone likes to take an oral contraceptive. Not everyone
wants a ring. I think to be successful [in developing new meth-
ods for drug delivery], we need to have choices for women."

are only beginning to understand the extent
to which different Asian American groups ex-
hlbit unique patterns of maternal health risks,
health care use, and health outcomes. Diver-
gent patterns of prenatal care use and low
birthweight and infant mortality risks have
been observed among various Asian Ameri-
can subgroups, between specific Asian Ameri-
can groups and Whites, and between native-
1-13
bom and foreign-bom Asian Americans.
Early access to and adequate use of pre-
natal care have been associated with posi-
tive birth outcomes among Asian Ameri-

and because it provides the
opportunity for health education and the
early identification and treatment of preg-
nancy complications a_nd medical conditions,

nic variations in prenatal care use are not
fully understood, financial obstacles, lan-

quently cited precursors to inadequate use,
along with transportation problems, lack of
spousal support, the need for child care, and

To date, no study has examined the use of
prenatal care by Asian Americans at the na-
tional level. The objective of this study was to
exarnine the sociodemographic predictors of
3 patterns of prenatal care use—no care, late
Initiation of care, and inadequate use after an
early iniüation of prenatal care—for the 4
largest Aslan American ethnic groups in the
United States: Japanese, Chinese, Koreans,
and Viemamese.
METHODS
The data used in fflis study were drawn
from the 1992—1996 US natality (live birth)
files compiled by the Nadonal Center for
Health Statistics. In 1992, expanded coding
of maternal race groups became available on
national vital record files, which enabled the

Objectives. This study examined the predictors of 3 patterns of prenatal care use (no care, late ini-
tiation of care, and inadequate use after early initiation) for 4 Asian American ethnic groups in the
United States.
Methods. Single live births to US resident mothers of Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese
ancestry (n =273 604) were selected from the 1992-1996 US natality files. Logistic regression was
used to analyze the effects of matemal characteristics on the 3 use measures.
Results, Korean Americans and Vietnamese Americans had the lowest levels of prenatal care use.
Young or single motherhood, high parity for age, and low educational attainment were the main risk fac-
tors for low use.
Conclusions. Considerable variability exists in prenatal care use amongAsian American ethnic groups.

identification of Korean and Vietnamese
groups in addition to those of Chinese and
Japanese extraction. Single live births (n =
273 604) to US resident mothers of Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, and Vietnamese ancestry
were selected. Information was not available
from vital recorcls to determine whether
women came to the United States before or
during pregnancy. Ethnicity of mother
uld father was determined by maternal re-
port on the bith ceråficate. For examination
of cultural effects on prenatal care use, a vari-
able was created to indicate whether mater-
nal and paternal ethnicity were the same.
Adequacy of prenatal care use was defined
by üle R-GINDEX, which incorporates 3 vari-
ables (bimester when prenatal care began,
number of visits, and the gestational age of
the infant at birth) to assess adequacy of
25.31
use. Gestaåona] age in completed weeks
was calculated as the interval between date of
delivery and date of last menshua-l period.
High educaåonal attainment was defined
as 13 or more years of education (i.e., beyond
high school). Low educaäonal attainment was
defined as less than 12 years of education
(i.e., less than high school). Because adoles-
cents have not had the same opportunity to
achieve the level of education as adults, ado-
lescents 2 or more years above the grade
level for their age were classified as having
high educational attainment, whereas those 2
or more years below their expected grade
, Vol 91, No. 11
level for their age were defined as having low
educational attainment. This coding scheme
facilitates the exarnination of the impact of
low educational attainment in isolation from
38
the influence of young matemal age.
Parity was determined by the number of
previous live births. Having children at home
may represent a potential barrier to care
owing to child care concerns. High parity for
age was defined as 1 or more previous births
for adolescents, 3 or more previous births for
mothers aged 18 to 21 years, 4 or more pre-
vious births for mothers aged 22 to 24 years,
and 5 or more previous births for mothers
aged 25 years and older. 39
Chi-square analyses were used to test for
differences in the proportion of maternal risk
characterisåcs among ethnic goups. Owing to
the large number of cases in frie data file,
most comparisons would be anticipated to be
statistically significant. Logistic regression anal-
yses were used to examme the independent
effects of sociodemographic characterisfics on
prenatal care use. Three separate models were
run. The first model compared the receipt of
no prenatal care wiffl the receipt of any prena-
tal care. n-le second model compared early
(first trimester) initiation of prenatal care with
later initiation. Women with no prenatal care
were excluded from the second model. The
third model focused solely on women who
started care in the first trimester, comparing
inadequate with adequate or intermediate

prenatal care use. 'I his latter model was de-
signed to specifically target women who began
care early but then did not maintain the rec-
ommended schedule of visits. The independ-
ent considered in each logistic
regression analysis included nativity status,
similarity of parental ethnicity, maternal eth-
niC1ty, age, educaåonal attainment, and parity.
For each of the 4 ethnic groups, the logistic re-
gression analysis comparing first trimester ini-
tiaåon of prenatal care with later entry into
care was repeated to assess ethnic-specific pre-
dictors of early prenatal care use.
RESULTS
Significant ethnic differences .01)
were found for every characteristic of socio-
demographic and prenatal care use exam-
ined (Table I). The percentage of mothers
who were unmarried ranged from 6.2% of
Korean American women to 17.9% of Viet-
namese American women. Vietnamese
American women were most likely to be
adolescents, while Korean American women
were the least likely to be 35 years or older.
Vietnamese American women were most
likely to be of high parity for age or to have

low educational attaimnent. Japanese Ameri-
can women were the least likely to be for-
eign born (52.9%) or to have the same eth-
nicity as the father.
Japanese Americans demonstrated the
highest Eikelihood of early initiation of care
and Chinese Americans were least likely to
receive no care. Viemamese American moth-
ers had the highest rate of no prenatal caæ.
Ihe results of the logistic regression analy-
ses are presented in Table 2. Unmarried
women, teenagers, and those with high parity
for age and low educational attainment were
significantly more likely to have no prenatal
care. High educational attainment and having
the same race as the father were protective
against receiving no prenatal care. Compared
with Chinese Americans, the other 3 Asian
Amefican subgroups had a greater risk of not
receiving any prenatal ca.le
Women who were unmarried, younger than
18 years, primiparous, and foreign born and
who had high parity for age and low educa-
tional attainment were significantly more likely
to begin care after the first trimester (Table 2).
Older and more highly educated women were
more likely to begin care early. Compared with
Chinese AmeHcans, Korean Americans had a
greater risk of late initiation of care, while Viet-
namese Arnericans were less likely to start pre•
natal care after the first trimester.
On the basis of the logistic regression anal-
yses of less-than-adequate use for women
who initiated care in the first trimester, moth-
ers who were unmarried and foreign born
and had high parity for age and the same eth-
nicity as the father were significantly tnore
likely not to maintain an adequate use sched-
ule after starting care early (Table 2). Mater-
nal age of 35 years and older, primiparity,
and high educational attainment were protec-
tive factors. Compared with Chinese Ameri-
cans, Korean Americans were significantly
more likely to have inadequate prenatal care
after a first trimester start of care.
Table 3 provides the logistic regression re-
sults of the 4 ethnic-specific models of prena-
tal care initiation after the first trimester For
all ethnic groups, single marital status, mater-
nal age younger than 18 years, high parity for
age, and low educational attainment were risk
factors for a late start of care, while high edu-
cational attainment was protective. Primipar-
ity increased the risk of starting care late for
Vietnamese Americans but decreased the risk
for Korean Americans. Being foreign born in-
creased the risk of starting care late for all
ethnic groups except Vietnamese Americans;
for this ethnic group, being foreign born
markedly decreased the risk. Having the
same race as the father increased the risk of a
late initiation of care for Korean Americans
but was protective for Japanese Americans
and Vietnamese Americans.
DISCUSSION
This analysis revealed notable variaåon
across ethnic groups in maternal socioeco-
nomic characteristics and the use of prenatal
care. The 2 poups that included the highest
proportion of foreign-born women, Korean
Americans and Vietnamese Americans,
showed the greatest likelihood of receiving no
care. Korean Americans exhibited a higher
Hsk of beginning care late and receiving inad-
equate care even when care began early.
Many of the risk factors for no or late initi-
aåon of care found in this study were the
same as those reported for the US population
generally: young or single motherhood, high

care, the availability of culturally and linguis-
tically competent prenatal services, and wom-
en's knowledge and beliefs about the impor-
tance of care during a norrnal pregnan%7 are
likely to be important factors, parbcularly for
recent Immigrants. The lack of information in
vital records about a woman's economic sta-
tus and her length of fime in the United
States also limits our ability to explain the
correlates of inadequate prenatal care use.

cave adequate prenatal care-40 In addition, 1
of the 2 overarching goals of Healthy People

underlines the importance of further investi-
gation to determine the particular ethnic-

Abstract—The Study was aimed to explore the relationship
between nature experience activities and the multiple
intelligences with 5-7 year-old children with autism. The
results showed that the integration of nature experience
activities can significantly enhance the language of autistic
children, self-reflection and naturalist intelligence, logical,
spatial, musical, interpersonal intelligence also effectiveness,
but improved in body intelligence less significant. Nature
experience activities designed for children with autism from
tactile sensitive part to play, according to the different
characteristics of children with autism, to find a suitable
stimulus or reinforcements to help autistic children's
emotional stability. Although children with autism often
rejection characteristics of the new things, but in this study
found a high acceptance of autistic children to the natural
world, the curriculum and more integrated into the natural
elements, will help children with autism learning.

1 . INTRODUCTION
Touching with nature could contribute to the
development of children's positive emotions (including
increased self-confidence, promoting peer social relations
and racial integration and to enhance the relationship
between teachers and students) (Crompton & Sellar, 1981)
and to reduce anger and aggression (Ulrich, 1993; Kaplan
and Kaplan, 1989; Harting et al, 2003), Brown, Odom &
Conroy (2001) also pointed out that doing activities in the
natural environment for handicapped children could
contribute to the development of their interpersonal
relationships.
Generally, there are some problems on communication
and interaction behavior for children with autism. When
they face to inhuman things (such as nature) the children
with autism often become more comfortable. The teaching
method on autism children emphasizes multisensory (Wang,
2000) and the experience of touching nature would be the
original and appropriate way.
The objects of this study were 5-7 year-old children with
autism and would explore the relationship between nature
experience activities with their development of multiple
intelligences. For autistic children, they often have some
cognitive, sensory, emotional, and social interaction
problems and it could be stimulated sensory sense through
the experience of contact with nature.
11 . METHODS
A. Research Objects
The object of this study was one NGO Foundation
special class for children with autism. There were 8chilren
in class and of which four mild autism and 4 for the
moderate autism.
B. About team teaching teachers
This study was designed on theme courses by the
original class, and we tried to involved nature experience
activities into lesson plan content. We discussed lesson
amendments with team teaching teacher, and the class was
leading the activities by them.
C. Nature experience activities design
Nature experience activities were designed in accordance
with original theme and integrated with natural materials
(such as natural adventure treasure hunt, collect leaves,
twigs or other natural objects, trunk rubbing, grass skiing
on coconut leaves, imitated small ants, crawling roll in the
grass). We implemented the curriculum in adjacent park,
and the implementation time of 201 IOctober to December
every Thursday morning 10:20 to 11 :OO.
D. Data collection
This study used participant observation to collect the
change of status of the multiple intelligences of children
before and after each class. The scales of multiple
intelligences were assessed by researchers, team teaching
teachers as well as Occupational Therapist in accordance
with the status of children on activities. The multiple
intelligences scales were modified by each activity,
including before and after assessment, comprehensive
assessment and special event records.
E. Analysis methods
The analysis methods were used by descriptive statistical
analysis and paired t test to analyze the difference of the
multiple intelligences and observation records were
extracted and summarized the related conditions of children
in various intelligence activities.
111 .RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. The linguistic intelligence
In linguistic intelligence, it was found significant
differences between before and after activity by paired
t-test. From Figure I we could see there was no consistency
trend on before and after score of first children but the
score of after activity higher than before for the second and
third child. Therefore, it was increased on linguistic
intelligence.

In addition, it was found that children in the nature were
proactive attentiveness than indoor course from the
observation records, even for easily distracted children.
After the teacher explained, most of them could perform
activities in accordance with instructions especially some
activities children more interested in, such as pushing ball,
looking for natural objects.
B. The logical intelligence
In logical part, there were significant differences of the
two children before and after the activity by paired t-test.
From Figure 2, there was no difference at four times before
and after scores for first child but the score of after activity
all higher than before for the third child. So, it was found
two trends were enhanced and another less obvious on
logical intelligence. In addition, activities associated with
the logical intelligence all could be completed for children
from observation records.
D. The body intelligence
There was significant differences just on one child before
and after the activity by paired t-test in body intelligence.
From Figure 4, there was no difference at before and after
scores for the second and third child but the score of after
activity higher than before for the first child. So, it was
found one was enhanced and another two less obvious on
body intelligence. Children could put in activities happily
about body activities such as pushing balls, grass skiing,
rolling body, creeping forward.

C. The spatial intelligence
There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t-test in spatial
intelligence. From Figure 3, there was no difference at
before and after scores for the second child but the score of
after activity all higher than before for the first and third
child. So, it was found two trends were enhanced and
another less obvious on spatial intelligence. In addition,
children could perform well at activities about spatial
intelligence, such as finding trees, picking up nature
objects.

In fact, activities with touching nature were excluded by
some children at beginning but they accepted quickly. This
is difficult to do for children with autism. Moreover,
touching different nature materials could usefully reduce
their tactile sensitivity.
E. The musical intelligence
There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t-test in musical
intelligence. From Figure 5, there was no difference at
before and after scores for the second child but the score of
after activity was little higher than before for the first and
the after score was obviously higher than before for the
third child. So, it was found two trends were enhanced and
another less obvious on musical intelligence. In addition,
children actively participate in activities and nature
experience activities stimulate children to opening their
mouth to sing from observation records.

F. The interpersonal intelligence
There were significant differences of the two children
before and after the activity by paired t-test in interpersonal
intelligence. From Figure 6, there was no difference at
before and after scores for the first child but the score of
after activity was obvious difference than before for the
second and third child. So, it was found two trends were
enhanced and another less obvious on interpersonal
intelligence. The nature experience activities were helpful
for children with well order and learning waiting.

materials were excluded by some children and loved by the
others even concentrated natural materials only and just
want to touch them not to attend activities teacher lead.
However, they were mostly pleased when contacting with
nature and created new play or share with others.

In Self-reflection intelligence, it was found significant
differences between before and after activity by paired
t-test. From Figure 7, there was the great difference than
before for the third child. Therefore, it was increased on
self-reflection intelligence. The emotion of children was
reflected when they contact with nature at beginning. They
were gradually concentrated on the activity in nature and
more stable on emotion later.

In nature observation intelligence, it was found
significant differences between before and after activity by
paired t-test. From Figure 8, the score of second and third
child was the great difference than the first one. Therefore,
it was increased on nature observation intelligence. Natural

Involved with nature experience actives could
significantly enhance the development of language,
self-reflection and naturalist intelligence of children
with autism and also be promoted on the logical,
spatial, musical, interpersonal intelligence. But there
was no significant change on body intelligence.
The nature experience activities could be exerted by
tactile sensitivity of children with autism according to
the different characteristics of them to find a suitable
stimulus or reinforcements to help the stability of their
emotion.
It was found children with autism have high
acceptance for nature materials although they often
reject to touch new things. Therefore, the nature
experience activities integrated into the curriculum will
contribute to their learning of children with autism.

gender affirming hormone therapy. The primary outcomes of interest were parental desire and pri-
orities for fertility preservation.
Fifty-seven individuals (46 adults and 11 youths) completed the survey; 51% were transgender
women, 35% were transgender men, and 14% identified as non-binary. 32 participants expressed
interest in (n = 15, 26%) or uncertainty about (n = 18, 32%) future parenthood. 48% of partici-
pants had considered gamete cryopreservation, but only 7% each previously completed or planned
to pursue this fertility option; 67% cited cost as a barrier. Participants with interest in or uncer-
tainty about future parenthood were more likely to consider cryopreservation (P <.OOI) or stop-
ping hormones for fertility preservation (P <.OOI ). 58% of respondents reported discussing fertility
preservation with a health care provider with lower rates among youth participants (P = .017).
From a family planning perspective, 58% of respondents described counseling as adequate; 23%
described it as inadequate and 19% reported not receiving any counseling. Participants who
endorsed strong or uncertain parental desire were more likely to report inadequate counseling
(P = .016).
Gender diverse individuals interested in or undecided about future parenthood were more likely to
consider cryopreservation and report inadequate family planning counseling. Therefore, current
counseling practices may be insufficient and referral to a fertility specialist should be considered.

research challenges these findings. Transgender youth
must consider fertility preservation options carefully as

of family planning counseling is sparse, but 1 study found

not think they received adequate information.
To better describe perspectives about fertility preserva-
tion and family planning in the transgender population of
the United States, we surveyed adults and youth pursuing
GAHT at an endocrinology clinic about fertility-related
care. We assessed desires for future parenthood and
obstacles to parenthood. Furthermore, we evaluated for
the presence and adequacy of family planning counseling.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This cross-sectional survey study utilized an anonymous non-val-
idated online survey built on the REDCap electronic data cap-
ture platform. The study was conducted at a single academic
medical center in the adult and pediatric endocrinology clinics.
Individuals referred to these clinics between February 2021 and
May 2022 for GAHT were screened for eligibility. Only individ-
uals no older than 55 years of age were eligible for participation.
Individuals unable to provide informed consent and vulnerable
populations were excluded. This study was reviewed and
approved by an Institutional Review Board.
Participant recruitment and informed consent occurred in-
person during a clinic visit or post-hoc via telephone (only for
adults). At the conclusion of a clinic visit (or after conclusion
for telephone recruitment), eligible individuals were offered the
opportunity to participate. Informed consent to use de-identified
data was verbal for adults and written for youth. Participants
were then given a QR code and/or emailed a link to the RED-
Cap survey. The survey was completed at a time and location
convenient to the participant.
The REDCap survey was divided into 3 sections: demo-
graphics, family planning, and fertility preservation. We
included a screening question to ensure the survey was not com-
pleted more than once by a single individual. In the family plan-
ning section, we asked about current children, desires for future
children, and obstacles to parenthood. Gender affirming care,
priorities related to cryopreservation, and participant experien-
ces with family planning counseling were addressed in the fertil-
ity preservation section. The survey instrument is available as a
supplemental document.
Our primary measures of interest were the desire for future
parenthood and interest in fertility preservation among transgen-
der individuals. In addition, we assessed obstacles to future par-
enthood and the adequacy of family planning counseling in this
cohort. Survey responses were compared according to age group,
sex assigned at birth, and self-described parental desire. Descrip-
tive statistics were ca culated for continuous variables. Univari-
ate t-tests were used to analyze continuous data and chi-square
tests of independence were used for categorical data. Missing
data points were excluded from analyses. All statistical analyses
were completed using SPSS@ software (IBM SPSS, Armonk,
NY).
RESULTS
Subject Demographics
During the study period, 112 individuals presented for GAHT;
11 were not eligible for this study due to age. The remaining
individuals were approached and 80 consented to participate.
Ultimately, 57 gender diverse persons (71% of those consented)
seeking GAHT completed the online survey — 46 adults and 11
youths. Table I
displays characteristics of survey respondents.
Respondents AFAB were younger and more likely to identify as
non-binary compared with their AMAB counterparts. Overall,
83% of respondents reported receiving GAHT, and 67% had
been on this therapy for at least 6 months. Transgender youth
were less likely to be on GAHT. Only 18% reported a history of

gender affirming surgery with no difference noted between age
groups or sex assigned at birth. Few participants had an existing
biologically related child. Those who did were exclusively
AMAB. The most common type of health insurance was
employer or union sponsored coverage (67%), including as a
dependent; no respondents reported being uninsured.
Parental Desire and Access to Fertility Preservation
Table 2
displays family planning considerations respondents
were asked about in the survey.: 26% expressed interest in future
parenthood, 32% were undecided, and 42 % were not interested.
Those with strong or uncertain parental desire were most likely
to consider a future biologically related child important. All
these respondents were adults (n = 17, 38%, P = .015). None of
the participants with current children expressed interest in
future parenthood.
Although 48% of respondents had considered gamete preser-
vation, only 7.0% previously completed this fertility option and
only another 7.0% planned to pursue it. Notably, those who
were interested in or undecided about future parenthood
reported higher interest in gamete cryopreservation but did not
have statistically significant higher planning or completion rates.
They were, however, more willing to stop GAHT for cryopreser-
vation. Importantly, 67% of respondents cited cost as a barrier
to cryopreservation with higher rates among those with strong or
uncertain parental desire. Respondents interested in a future
biologically related child were also more likely to consider cryo-
preservation (82% vs 33%, P <.OOI), stop GAHT for cryopreser-
vation (69% vs 16%, P <.OOI ), and cite cost as a barrier (88% vs
61 %, P = .040). Compared with individuals who do not consider
a future biologically related child important, this group planned
or completed cryopreservation at a statistically significant higher
rate (31% vs 7.7%, P = .024). The most common preferred alter-
native family planning option was adoption (86%).
There were some important differences between AMAB
and AFAB respondents. All participants who completed cryo-
preservation were AMAB (n = 4, 13%, P = .058). In contrast,
AFAB respondents were more likely to cite cost as a barrier
(84% vs 57%, P = .029) to cryopreservation and list the com-
plexity of the medical process as an obstacle to future parent-
hood (42% vs 16%, P = .029). They were also more willing
to stop GAHT for fertility preservation (46% vs 18%,
P = .025).
Table 3
displays reasons that may prevent future parenthood
selected by survey participants. There were 32 individuals either
interested in future parenthood or undecided; these participants
more frequently cited financial status and the complexity of the
medical process as reasons that may prohibit future parenthood.
In contrast, 24 individuals expressed no parental desire; they
more frequently identified current parenthood as a reason they
may avoid future parenthood. Participants who considered a
future biologically related child important also frequently listed
complexity of the medical process (59% vs 15%, P <.OOI) as a
reason that may prevent parenthood. However, financial status
was not a statistically significant barrier for this group (53% vs
31%, P = .12). Only 49% of respondents felt that society views
LGBTQ parenting as acceptable, however, most (61%) also
indicated that societal views have no influence on their family
planning choice and only 2 cited this as a barrier to future par-
enthood. Of note, these 2 individuals also expressed interest in
future parenthood.
Family Planning Counseling
Only 58% of survey respondents reported discussing fertility
preservation with a health care provider. This was less common
among transgender youth than adults (27% vs 67%, P = .017).
displays how participants described the adequacy of the
Figure I
fertility and family planning counseling they have received from
health care providers: 58% of respondents described counseling
as adequate, 23% described it as inadequate, and 19% reported
not receiving counseling. Responses to this question re-demon-
strate a lower rate of counseling among transgender youth.
AFAB respondents also reported lower rates of adequate
counseling. Participants interested in or undecided about future
parenthood reported inadequate counseling more frequently
than those without parental desire who endorsed adequate and
absent counseling at higher rates. This pattern was not reflected
between participants who do and do not consider a future bio-
logically related child important.
COMMENTS
In this study of transgender youth and adults seeking
GAHT with endocrinology providers, we found that 58%
of participants were interested (26%) or undecided (32%)
about future parenthood. There was no difference in

parental desire between adult and youth respondents. We
found that transgender individuals with strong or uncer-
tain parental desire considered fertility preservation at
high rates and were more likely to report inadequate fam-
ily planning counseling. Regardless of parental desire, few
participants completed cryopreservation. Our findings add
to the ongoing characterization of family planning desires
among transgender persons. Importantly, we demon-
strated that many gender diverse people of reproductive
age are undecided about future parenthood while pursuing
GAHT and would benefit from further counseling.
A recent multi-center survey-based study of 80 Ameri-
can transgender adults reported similar rates of parental
desire as our study. They found a mean desire for parent-

of 543 transgender adults living in Belgium found that
23.6% of AMAB and 39.6% of AFAB respondents had

undecided, respectively.
The median age of that
cohort was 43 years for AMAB and 24 years for AFAB
participants compared with 23 years for our study of trans-
gender adults and youth. Most studies of transgender
youth comment on desire for future biologically related
children, however, 1 Canadian study did find that 66% of
21
participants expressed desire for any future parenthood.
Our findings regarding parental desire are very similar to
these studies that show a little more than half of transgen-
der persons have interest in future parenthood.

related child was important to 30% of participants, similar
to prior studies. All respondents who placed importance
in a future biologically related child were adults, consis-
tent with recent observations that biologically related
children may not be important to transgender youth.
Adoption appears to be the preferred alternative with
more than 70% of respondents endorsing it in this study
13,21
and the existing literature.
Furthermore, there was sig-
nificant variability in desire for a biologically related child
depending on parenting intentions: 50% among unde-
cided and interested vs 4.2% among not interested. This
is particularly important given evidence for the fertility
impact of GAHT and our finding that one third of indi-
viduals presenting for GAHT have not solidified their
intentions for future children.
While 48% of respondents in our study considered gam-
ete cryopreservation, less than 10% either planned to pur-
sue or previously completed fertility preservation. As
expected, participants who expressed strong or uncertain
parental desire were much more likely to consider cryo-
preservation (>70%) compared with those not interested
in parenthood. Importantly, they did not pursue or com-
plete fertility preservation at statistically significant higher
rates. Our results are consistent with other published
results: 1 study found that 37.5% of transgender men con-
sidered gamete cryopreservation and another found that
51 % of transgender women would have considered fertil-
11
ity preservation if it had been offered. In contrast, rates
11,22
of cryopreservation are usually less than 5%.
Simi-
larly, several studies identify that less than 10% of trans-
gender youth in North America complete fertility
preservation with higher rates among transgender

Interestingly, studies out of Australia and the
women.
Netherlands found rates of sperm cryopreservation among
AMAB gender diverse youth between 38% and 62%, pos-
23
sibly related to lower costs.
Cessation of GAHT is an important consideration for
gender diverse individuals pursuing cryopreservation as
the impacts on fertility potential are at least partially
reversible when stopped. Prior studies indicate that stop-
ping GAHT is a barrier to fertility preservation for 20%-

25% of transgender adults,
but willingness to stop
17
GAHT increases with self-reported parental desire.
From the youth perspective, only 3% indicate willingness
12
to delay GAHT for fertility preservation. In our study
only 32% of respondents expressed willingness to stop
GAHT for fertility preservation; however, respondents
with interest in or uncertainty about future parenthood
expressed a much higher willingness (69% and 44%,
respectively) to stop hormones. We also found that indi-
viduals AFAB may be more willing to stop GAHT. This
finding accentuates the importance of appropriately timed
counseling prior to the initiation of GAHT, which would
eliminate the need to consider stopping hormone therapy.
Transgender individuals include cost as a barrier to fer-
tility preservation as frequently as 39-60% of the

gamete cryopreservation and higher rates among those
with strong or uncertain parental desire. Fewer respond-
ents (37%) endorsed their current financial circumstance
as an obstacle to future parenthood. Notably, individuals
AFAB (compared with AMAB) were more likely to con-
sider cost a barrier to fertility preservation. This associa-
tion did not persist when considering the financial
implications of future parenthood. As such, cost may
influence parental desire separate from the price of fertility
preservation. Other commonly endorsed reasons that may
prevent future parenthood included lack of desire (35%)
and the complexity of the medical process (28%) with
complexity more frequently listed by individuals AFAB.
Our findings corroborate the obstacles to fertility preserva-
tion listed in recent studies, as well as the greater influence
16,20
of medical complexity on individuals AFAB.
Professional societies recommend counseling gender
diverse individuals about the fertility consequences and
family planning options prior to the initiation of
GAHT.8 10 Despite universal knowledge of the potential
fertility implications of GAHT, only 58% of our cohort
reported discussing fertility preservation with a health
care provider with lower rates among youth. These find-
ings are consistent with counseling rates reported in the

adult and pediatric literature
they indicate an
opportunity to improve fertility counseling for gender
diverse persons. Comparatively, research indicates clini-
cians providing transgender care perceive they perform
counseling at a higher rate While self-
reported provider-level barriers in that study were low,
15%-20% of clinicians providing transgender care
reported lack of knowledge about fertility implications
and preservation options as an impediment to well-
informed discussions with patients.
Few studies assess the perceived adequacy of family
planning counseling received by gender diverse individu-
als. In our study, 58% of respondents described counseling
as adequate; 23% described it as inadequate and 19%
reported not receiving any counseling whatsoever. Ade-
quacy of counseling varied with age, sex assigned at birth,
and parental desire. Adults reported adequate counseling
and youth reported no counseling at higher rates, respec-
tively. AMAB individuals also reported higher rates of
adequate counseling than their AFAB counterparts. Of
note, AFAB individuals were younger in this study, which
may explain some of this variability. Perhaps most impor-
tant, individuals pursuing GAHT with strong or uncertain
parental desire reported significantly higher rates of inade-
quate counseling. These data suggest that current counsel-
ing paradigms may be insufficient for those most at risk of
GAHT impacting future family planning. Referring this
subset of people to a fertility specialist could improve the
counseling they receive.
Our study is not without limitations. It was conducted at
an academic endocrinology clinic among gender diverse per-
sons of reproductive age presenting for GAHT using a non-
validated survey instrument, which means the results may
not be generalizable to the larger transgender population.
UROLOGY 171, 2023


For example, not all gender diverse individuals choose to
medically or surgically transition. This decision could influ-
ence their response to questions related to fertility-related
care. Furthermore, our survey did not query participants who
provided counseling, when that counseling occurred (ie,
before or after GAHT), or which provider (ie, our institu-
tion vs another institution) they were considering when
answering the survey. Thus, our survey may reflect partici-
pant perception of counseling provided by our institution,
which we hypothesize may be an overestimate due to the
specialized nature of our clinic, and limits measurement of
counse ing adequacy prior to initiating GAHT. Furthermore,
participants in this study were more insured than most
25
descriptive studies of transgender persons and we likely
underestimated the influence of cost on decision making. As
a cross-sectional survey-based study the influence of response
bias must be considered. Approximately 20% of eligible peo-
ple declined to participate in the study and 30% of con-
sented participants did not complete the online survey; it is
difficult to predict how their responses would change the
results of this study. Response bias may have also contributed
to the age difference between AMAB and AFAB individu-
als. Despite these limitations, many of our results uphold
findings from population-level studies. Our findings are also
limited by a small sample size, especially for transgender
youth and non-binary persons. This likely made our study
underpowered to highlight small-to-moderate differences
between these groups and the general cohort. Finally, due to
the cross-sectional design we could not assess how responses
changed over time. For example, we could not measure
whether differences between youth and adults remained con-
stant or narrowed as adolescents mature.
CONCLUSION
Gender diverse individuals interested in or undecided
about future parenthood constitute a sizable portion of
individuals presenting for GAHT. Current family plan-
ning counseling practices appear to be insufficient for edu-
cating and supporting transgender people undergoing
hormonal gender transition, especially those interested in
future parenthood. As such, all persons presenting for gen-
der affirming care should be queried about future parental
desire to guide clinician attention to counseling and refer-
ral to fertility specialists.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Almost 15% of all pregnant women can develop potentially life-threatening
complications. As a result, identification of high-risk pregnancy at earliest stage will be useful in
directing appropriate intervention. Hence, the current study was done to determine the prevalence
and outcome of high-risk pregnancy among antenatal women in rural Puducherry.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A record-based longitudinal study was done during March 2018
among 569 antenatal women who have attended rural health center of tertiary care institute. High-risk
pregnancy was classified based on the guidelines from Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva Abhiyan
and outcome assessment based on the obstetric and neonatal outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 569 antenatal case record reviewed, 315 (55.3%) were in the age group of
20—25 years and majority (463, 81.4%) belonged to below poverty line families; 410 (74.3%) registered
their current pregnancy within the first trimester. The prevalence of high-risk pregnancy among study
participants was 18.3% (95% confidence interval: 15.3%—21.7%). Majority (81.9%) had term delivery.
Regarding obstetric and neonatal outcomes, majority had spontaneous vaginal delivery (73.9%);
about 10.4% gave birth to low-birth weight baby, and only 1 .70/0 had stillbirth. Parity, socioeconomic
status, and unfavorable outcomes such as low-birth weight, preterm, and postterm delivery were
associated with high-risk pregnancy.
CONCLUSION: The current study found that almost one-fifth of the pregnant women in rural area have
high-risk pregnancy. Unfavorable obstetric and neonatal outcomes were common among high-risk
cases. Hence, early detection of high-risk pregnancy needs to be done at primary health-care level
to improve the maternal, obstetric, and neonatal outcomes.

Majella, et al.: Outcome of high risk pregnancy in India
as a result of complications during antenatal period
and childbirth. There are five main reasons for death of
pregnant women such as severe hemorrhage, maternal
infections, unsafe abortion, hypertension-related
disorders of pregnancy such as preeclampsia and
eclampsia, and medical complications such as cardiac
conditions, HIV / AIDS, or diabetes complicating or
complicated by pregnancy.[3] Hence, all the pregnancies
need to be evaluated for high-risk pregnancy through
routine antenatal care provided by the health-care
professionals.
Identification of high-risk pregnancy, causes, and its
complications through quality antenatal care helps in
achieving favorable maternal, obstetric, and neonatal
outcome.[451 In addition, women identified to be at high
risk need to be followed up at regular intervals through
routine care by the health workers at health facility
and home visits to prevent the development of any
maternal or fetal complications. Apart from follow-up
care, appropriate laboratory investigations and referral
services also required to improve the outcome of
pregnancy. Prognosis of the outcome also depends on the
type of high-risk pregnancy among pregnant mothers.[61
Hence, identification of type of high-risk pregnancy at
earliest stage will be useful in directing the appropriate
intervention measures for pregnant women.
Even though many studies have been done to determine
the prevalence of high-risk pregnancy in India,
fewer studies were done to determine the outcome
of high-risk pregnancy in rural settings, especially in
South India.[7] Hence, the current study was done to
determine the prevalence and outcome of high-risk
pregnancy and factors associated with it among antenatal
women attending rural primary health-care center in
Puducherry, South India.
Materials and Methods
This is a record-based longitudinal study conducted
by reviewing the maternal and child health (MCH)
register maintained in the antenatal clinic of JIPMER
Rural Health Centre (JIRHC) during March 2018.
Records were reviewed for the details of pregnant
women available over a period of 5 years from
January 2013 to December 2017. JIRHC caters to a
population of around 10,000 spread over four villages,
namely, Ramanathapuram, Thondamanatham,
Pillaiyarkuppam, and Thuthipet. All the four villages
are located within 4 km of the health center which is
located in Ramanathapuram village. Health services
are provided by senior resident from the department
of preventive and social medicine, who is the medical
officer in charge of the health center, undergraduate
intern trainees, postgraduates posted from the
2
Department of Community Medicine, JIPMER, as well
as by nursing staff and public health nurses.
The antenatal clinic of JIRHC is a special clinic established
exclusively for providing comprehensive health checkup
and referral services of pregnant women under the
supervision of the department of community medicine.
It is functional once a week at health center which is
located in Ramanathapuram village. On an average,
25 pregnant women will be attending every antenatal
clinic and avail health-care services. The health-care
services include essential antenatal care services such as
registration of pregnancy, tetanus toxoid immunization,
recording of body weight and blood pressure at each
follow-up visit, basic laboratory investigations such as
hemoglobin, blood grouping, glucose challenge test,
venereal disease research laboratory, HIV, hepatitis B
surface antigen testing, provision of iron and folic acid
tablets, counseling for danger signs of pregnancy, birth
preparedness, nutrition, and importance of spacing,
contraception, immunization and breastfeeding,
obstetrician consultation and routine health and
antenatal checkup, follow-up, and referral services.
Patients who had missed the scheduled visit are being
followed by the health workers through mobile call or
home visit.
All the above-mentioned services are provided free of
cost. The obstetrician consultation is provided by senior
resident of the department of obstetrics and gynecology.
The counseling services are provided by staff nurse,
interns posted at JIRHC, and medical social worker. The
prescription for medication, laboratory investigations
to screen for complications, and also referral forms for
further follow-up in tertiary care center among high-risk
cases are given. The patient is advised to make regular
follow-up visits.
Each antenatal woman has a comprehensive case record
which is updated during every visit by the health
workers. The case records are issued by medical record
department with a unique identity number. This identity
number is entered in the attendees register maintained
at antenatal clinic. Confidentiality of information for
all pregnant women was maintained under this unique
identity number. The health workers update the blood
pressure during the visit, recent blood investigation
reports, and also regarding specific advice given to
pregnant women in that case record.
Line list of pregnant women who were registered in
antenatal clinic maintained at JIRHC was obtained. In
total, there were around 603 pregnant women registered
with antenatal clinic. Out of which, 569 records of
antenatal women were taken for the assessment of
high-risk pregnancy and outcome of the pregnancy. Rest

pregnancy by health-care workers.[31 The parameters
considered for diagnosis of high-risk pregnancy were
also defined as per the guidelines provided by PMSMA.

pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy were expressed as
proportion with 95% confidence interval (CI). Bivariate
analysis using Chi-square test was done to assess the
association of sociodemographic characteristics and
outcome of pregnancy with high-risk pregnancy.
Log-binomial regression was done to quantify the
association, and prevalence ratio (PR) with 95% CI was
reported. Variables with P < 0.05 were considered to be
statistically significant.
Results
In this record-based study, we reviewed MCH register
for the prevalence and outcome of high-risk pregnancy
among antenatal mothers registered between 2013 and
2017. There were a total of 603 registered pregnant
women during the study period. Since 34 records had
more missing data, they were removed, and 569 (94.4%)
were included in the final analysis.
The mean (SD) age of the study participants was
25 (3.7) years. Table 1 describes the sociodemographic
characteristics and obstetric index of the study participants.

Outcome of pregnancy was categorized based on the
following domains:
•
•
Obstetric outcome
i. Type of delivery — preterm (<37 weeks of
pregnancy), term (37—42 weeks of pregnancy),
and postterm delivery (>42 weeks of pregnancy)
ii. Mode of delivery — spontaneous vaginal delivery,
assisted vaginal delivery, and lower segment
cesarean section.
Neonatal outcome:
i. Birth weight of child — low-birth weight baby
(birth weight <2.5 kg), normal baby (birth
weight 22.5 kg)
ii. Status of birth — live birth, stillbirth, and abortion.
The pretesting was done with pro forma during February
2018 among five antenatal women case records, and
few modifications were made and EpiCollect file was
made for data extraction. No crosschecking was done
by interviewing the patient.
Data were entered into EpiCollect 5 (manufactured
by Imperial College, London), and analysis was done
using STATA version 12.0 (manufactured by StataCorp
LP, College Station, Texas). Continuous variables,
such as age, were summarized as mean (standard

pregnancy.
Parity and socioeconomic status were found to be
independently associated with high-risk pregnancy.
Similar findings were found in study done in
Karnataka.[101 However, we could not assess the other
factors influencing the high-risk pregnancy such as
education, age at marriage, and age at first pregnancy
which were reported by other studies. Outcome of the
pregnancy was also found to be unfavorable among the
high-risk cases in the current study, which is comparable
to the studies done in other parts of India.
Limited evidence available on birth outcomes reported
significant association between low-birth weight and
high-risk pregnancy which is comparable to the current
study finding. A study done in Nagpur also reported
that high-risk pregnancy had significant association with

lower segment cesarean section which is contrast to the
current study.[8] However, the current study found that
preterm and postterm delivery is more common among
high-risk pregnant women.
Major strength of the study is the use of standard
guidelines for the diagnosis of high-risk pregnancy
which will help to compare the current study findings
across various studies from India. All the records were
included in the study which represents the reality of the
status of pregnant women in rural setting. The current
study adds to the limited literature available regarding
outcome of high-risk pregnancy in a primary care setting.
However, the study has its own limitations. Since the
study is record based and we relied on the data recorded
in the case record, there could be errors in entering
the data of the pregnant women by the stakeholders.
We could not gather data on various possible factors

Majella, et al.: Outcome of high risk pregnancy in India
influencing high-risk pregnancy such as education,
employment status, spousal support, age at marriage,
and age at first pregnancy. Causal outcome for factors
related to high-risk pregnancy and outcomes cannot
be inferred as the data on time of exposure cannot be
retrieved from the case records. Further cohort studies
can be done to focus on factors influencing the high-risk
pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy.
High-risk pregnancy can have serious maternal,
obstetric, and neonatal complications if left undetected.
The Government of India has introduced several schemes
for early detection of high-risk pregnancy with recent
one being "PMSMA" which aims to provide quality
antenatal care for pregnant women throughout the
country. Even though several measures are taken to
tackle the problems, frequent monitoring by the relevant
stakeholders for success and quality of the schemes needs
to be done. This can be done by surveying the reduction
in the trend of high-risk pregnancy and increase in the
trend of favorable maternal and neonatal outcomes. This
can help in improving the quality of service delivery and
strengthen the interventions already in place.
Conclusion
The current study found that almost one-fifth of the
pregnant women in rural area have high-risk pregnancy
with majority of them contributed by maternal age and
PIH. Parity and socioeconomic status were independently
associated with high-risk pregnancy. Even though
most of the study participants had favorable obstetric
and neonatal outcomes, unfavorable outcomes such as
low-birth weight, preterm, and postterm delivery were
more common among high-risk antenatal women. Hence,
early detection of high-risk pregnancy needs to be done
at primary health-care level to improve the maternal,
obstetric, and neonatal outcome through quality and
accessible antenatal care and appropriate referral services.

Analyzing the Effect of Prenatal Care
on Pregnancy Outcome:
A Conditional Approach
Michael H. Malloy, MD, MS, Tzu-Cheg Kao, PhD, and Y. J. Lee, PhD
ABSTRACT
'Am€ricäniJournalOffÅibiié Health
InfrMuction
Vital statistics data is a readily avail-
able source of information on prenatal
care usage in the United States. How to
examine vital statistics and other types of
data for the effect of prenatal care on preg-
nan%' outcome has generated a number of
different methodologies. 1-4 One of the dif-
ficulties encountered in using such data
has been the problem of overcoming the
preterm bias effect. The preterm bias ef-
fect is associated with observing better
outcomes in women who receive prenatal
care than in women who receive no care.
This artifact occurs because women re-
ceiving no care may deliver prematurely
and may not have an opportunity to enroll
in prenatal care.5 By conditioning the ef-
fect of the age of entry into prenatal care
on the gestational age of delivery, how-
ever, the preterm bias effect can be
avoided. Nonetheless, other problems en-
countered in vital statistics data may in-
validate the results of the conditional ap-
proach.
In this study, we demonstrate the ef-
fect that the possible misclassification of
gestational age in vital statistics data has
on the interpretation of the conditional ap-
proach and discuss the problematic nature
of the evaluation of prenatal care.
The data for this analysis were ob-
tained from linked birth and death certif-
icates from Missouri for 1980 through
1984. The variables used in the analysis
were the gestational age at which prenatal
care was initiated (self-report and limited
to the first 36 weeks of pregnancy), the
gestational age at delivery (based on last
menstrual period), the outcome (stillbirth,
infant death, or alive at 1 year), race
(Black or non-Black), birth number (mul-
tiple vs single), parity, maternal age, and
maternal education. We used only those
records that involved gestational ages of
greater than 19 weeks and less than 51
weeks. Of the 387 173 records available,
375 858 (97.1%) were used for the unad-
justed analyses and 374 244 (96.7%) were
used for the adjusted analyses.
The association of the gestational age
of entry into prenatal care with pregnancy
outcome was examined relative to the ges-
tational age of delivery. Outcomes (still-
births or infant deaths) are presented as
death rates (percentage dead). We calcu-
lated odds ratios for stillbirths or infant
deaths by logistic regression models
adjusted for race (Black vs non-Black),
multiple births (multiple vs single), (O par-
ity and parity greater than 3 compared
with parity 1 through 3), maternal age (less
than 18 and greater than 34 compared with
18 through 34 years), and maternal edu-
cation (less than 12 compared with greater
than 12 years). Mantel-Haenszel tests for
linear trends were carried out for mortality
rates over the gestational ages of entry
into prenatal care.6 Furthermore, we
adjusted our results by declaring new-
borns that exceeded the 90th percentile
birth-weight standards for gestational age
reported by Arbuckle7 as misclassified.
All computations were carried out using
Results
By conditional analysis, the risk (per-
centage of mortality) of stillbirth or infant
death for those women who delivered at
25 weeks to 28 weeks of gestation and who
entered prenatal care between 1 and 4
weeks was greater than the risk of still-

birth or infant death for women who de-
livered at 25 to 28 weeks and received no
care (Table 1). The adjusted odds ratio
was 1.67 (95% confidence interval = 1.03,
2.71). This higher risk of mortality in early
entrants delivering before 29 weeks, how-
ever, appears to be an artifact of the mis-
classification of the gestational age of the
survivors. This is apparent when new-
borns with weights greater than the 90th
percentile for gestational age were not in-
cluded in the analysis (Table 2). The de-
clining mortality rates as the gestational
age of entry into prenatal care increased
observed in Table I are not apparent in
Table 2.
For women delivering after 36 weeks
of gestation, early entry into prenatal care
March 1992, Vol. 82, No. 3
was a marker for optimal pregnancy out-
come. The risk for stillbirth or infant death
increased progressively for those deliver-
ing at 37 through 42 weeks from a low of
0.60% for those who entered prenatal care
at 1 through 4 weeks to a high of 2.96% for
those who received no care (Table 1). The
results for this group in Table 1 are similar
to the results reported in Table 2.
Discussion
As Tyson et al. state, "the value of
prenatal care has been diffcult to estab-
lish."4 When the time of entry into pre-
natal care is assessed relative to the time
of delivery, several interpretations about
the association of prenatal care with preg-
nancy outcome become available. For ex-
ample, it appears that in women who de-
livered at less than 29 weeks and who
entered prenatal care in the first trimester,
there were more adverse pregnancy out-
comes than in those women who delivered
at this tü-ne and were not in prenatal care.
We believe this is an artifact. Kramer et al.
have reported a systematic underestima-
tion of gestational age in infants born be-
fore 37 weeks when the gestational age is
based solely on the last menstrual period.9
When infants weighing over the 90th per-
centile for their gestational age were elim-
inated from the analysis, there were no
ignificant trends in mortality rates over
the gestational age of entry into prenatal
care except for those women delivering

between 37 and 42 weeks. Whether pre-
natal care for these women is responsible
for the better outcome of the early en-
trants cannot be determined. Early entry
may reflect as much on the healthy behav-
ioral characteristics of these women as it
does on any effect of prenatal care.
The evaluation of prenatal care is a
complex problem. The incorrect assign-
ment of gestational age affects signifi-
cantly the results of any perinatal analysis
and continues to be a major problem for
which no solution is readily available. As
a result, there is no ideal model available
to assess the association between prenatal
care and pregnancy outcome. Because of
the substantial problems associated with
observational data, the use of randomized
trials of different modes of care deserves

The safety of Home Birth: The Farm
Study
A. Mark Durand, MI), MPH
Despite a sizable body of literature on
the subject, the authors of two recent re-
views have concluded that a final judg-
ment regarding the relative safety of home
birth still cannot be made.1,2
This study compares the outcomes of
a cohort of 1707 planned lay midwife—
attended home births from the Farm mid-
wifery service in rural Tennessee with the
outcomes of a sample of physician-at-
tended hospital births derived from the
1980 US National Natality/Nationa1 Fetal
Mortality Survey (NNS/NFMS). This is
the largest comparative study of a cohort
of home births yet published.
Previous studies of home birth safety
underscore the importance of having ex-
plicit comparison groups (rather than of
being strictly of considering
planned and unplanned home births
separately,2-4 of tracking intrapartum hos-
pital transfers of intended home births
(and attributing the outcome to the home
birth group),5 and of controlling for the
effects of birth weight, type of delivery
attendant, and demogaphic characteris-
tics of the mother .63 All these issues have
been addressed in this study.
Standards of prenatal care at the
Farm are modeled to the recommenda-
tions of the Arnerican College of Obste-
tricians and Gynecologists. Deliveries are
conducted without analgesia, however,
and great emphasis is placed on meeting
the emotional needs of the family. Several
family members and friends are com-
monly in attendance and are encouraged
to take an active role in the birth.8 In
addition, the laboring woman is encour-
aged to stay off her back and remain phys-
ically mobile through labor and delivery.
In the absence of signs of fetal distress,
women are permitted to labor beyond 24
hours, occasionally for 2 to 3 days. They
are also encouraged to eat and drink dur-
ing labor in the belief that this allays ma-
ternal oåaustion and the need for opera-
tive delivery.

ABSTRACT
Objectives. Different sources of
prenatal care data were used to exam-
ine the association between birth out-
comes of HIV-infected women and the
Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization
(APNCU) index.
Methods. Adjusted odds ratios of
birth outcomes for 1858 HIV-positive
mothers were calculated for APNCU
indexes on the basis of birth certificate
data or 3 types of physician visits on
Medicaid claims.
Results. Claims- and birth certifi-
cate—based APNCU indexes agreed
poorly (K < 0.3). Only the broadest
claims-based APNCU index had lower
adjusted odds ratios for low birth-
weight (0.64; 95% confidence interval
[CI]=O.49, 0.84) and preterm birth
(0.70; 95% Cl=o.54, 0.91). The birth
certificate—based index had a reduced
adjusted odds ratio (0.73; 95% CI=
0.56, 0.95) only for preterm bilth.
Conclusions. The association of
birth outcomes and adequacy of prena-
tal care in this HIV-infected cohort dif-
fered significantly depending on the
source of prenatal care data. (Am J Pub-

The impact of prenatal care on birth out-
comes has been an area of subqantialSontro-
versy in the public health qeld. I A number of
indexes, notably KotelchuÖk's Adequacy of-
Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU)
have been developed to study this issue.
Less attention, however, has been directed to
evaluating the type of data used to calculate
measures of the use of prenatal care.
Although vital statistics data are often
used as a sc%rce of information on prenatal
7 5-7 /
care, birth certificate records reflect the
Q!ber's recollection of her prenatal care his-
tory and her understanding of what consti-
tutes a prenatal care visit. Administrative data
provide an alternative source of such infor-
mation. These data offer the advantages of
eliminating patient recall as a potential
source of error and permitting specification
of the types of providers who deliver prenatal
care. Care from diverse types of primary and
specialty providers during pregnancy may
have distinct benefits for women with chroTfi
diseases such as HIV infection, who ave

increased risk of adverse birth outco es.
In this retrospective cohort stu y, we
computed APNCU indexes from birth certifi-
cate data and Medicaid claims for a cohort of
HIV-infected pregnant women. For the
claims-derived assessment, we computed
APNCU indexes for 3 progressively broad
definitions ofthe types of providers who con-
tribute to prenatal care. We hypothesized that

Methods
Data
We studied 1858 Medicaid recipients in
New York State who delivered live-born sin-
gleton children between 1993 and 1995, who
were identified by a tested case-finding
screen as HIV infected, and who had claims
data linked to vital statistics records (92% of
mothers). For mothers with multiple deliver-
ies in the study period, one delivery was ran-
domly selected. The study population also
reflects the prior exclusion of 14 mothers
who participated in programs that paid a
global fee for prenatal care, since we could
not determine the number or type of their
visits.
Birth outcomes served as the criteria for
our analyses. Low birthweight was specified
as less than 2500 g, and preterm birth was
defined as a gestational age of less than
37 weeks, based on the physician's esti-
mate or, when the physician's estimate was
unavailable (3.7% of cases), the mother's esti-
mate of her last menses.
The APNCU index was calculated in
4 ways. First, we used data on prenatal care
visits from vital statistics records. Then we
determined the number and timing of visits
from Medicaid claims for (l) obstetrics-
gynecology visits only; (2) obstetrics-
gynecology, family practice, or general
medicine services; and (3) obstetrics-gyne-

cology, any primary care, and HIV-related
specialty care (HIV-related specialties
include infectious disease, allergy/immunol-
ogy, hematology, and oncology). To simplify
the analysis, inadequate prenatal care was
compared with all other levels (i.e., ade-
quate plus, adequate, and intermediate)
combined.
To control for possible confounders, we
included several other maternal characteris-
tics in our multivariate analyses. Lacking
viral load and CD4 T-lymphocyte data, we
evaluated maternal HIV stage from diag-
noses previously reported to be predictive of
maternal—child HIV transmissio , including
history of clinical 'DS,- pne monia, or
anemia during pregnancy. _Chronic medical
conditions including hypertension, asthma,
and diabetes were also determined from
diagnoses on claims. Illicit drug use was
measured by an approach that, in previous
validation studies of claims data, identified
85% of SLf6jec)with illicit drug use noted
on charts 10 Other demographic and behav-
ioral covariates included age, race/ethnicity,
marital status, nativity (US, including Puerto
Rican, vs foreign), New York City resi-
dence, parity, year of delivery, educational
attainment, and smoking and alcohol use
during pregnancy.
Analysis
Simple K computed
to assess the chance-corrected agreement
among the different measures of adequate
prenatal care. These are interpreted in the
same way as intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients. To evaluate the relative strength of the
association between the variously specified
APNCU indexes and birth outcomes, we
compared 4 logistic regression models for
each outcome. Each model included the
same covariates with I of the 4 APNCU
indexes (there were no significant interaction
terms), and the adjusted odds ratio and 95%
confidence interval were contrasted.
Results
In 17% of the deliveries, the infants
were low-birthweight; a similar proportion
were preterm. The proportion of mothers
with adequate prenatal care utilization var-
ied from one half for the APNCU index
derived from vital statistics to two thirds for
the index based on visits to the most com-
prehensive set of providers (Table 1). As
shown by the K statistic, we observed poor
agreement between each of the 3 claims-
based APNCU indexes of prenatal care and
the birth certificate—based APNCU index.
Agreement among the claims-based mea-
sures was considerably better.
The adjusted odds ratios for the 4 types
of data source did not differ dramatically for
either birth outcome (Table 2). However, the
APNCU measure based on visits to the most
comprehensive set of providers—primary
care, obstetrics-gynecology, and HIV special-
ists—consistently showed the strongest asso-
ciation, with a 30% to 35% reduction in the
adjusted odds of either birth outcome. The
other indexes showed 15% to 20% reduc-
tions in the odds of low birthweight. How-
ever, the birth certificate—derived measure
showed a 25% reduction in the adjusted odds

The APNCU measure developed by
Kotelchuck was not intended to take into

ell ering obstetric and
gynecologic ser es. n considering visits
to other providers, such as internists and HIV
specialists, in a measure of adequacy of pre-
natal care, we may have classified some
women as having adequate prenatal care
when they actually had fewer obstetric visits
than recommended. However, we hypothe-
size that visits to these other providers facili-
tated detection and treatment of conditions
that could have had an adverse effect on birth
outcomes (e.g., serious infections, hyperten-
sion, severe anemia, asthma, or poor nutri-
tion). We cannot say whether a study of
healthy women or women with diseases other
than HIV infection would show a similar
advantage to considering care during preg-
nancy delivered by providers other than
obstetricians.

Our findings should prompt researchers
to consider the value of administrative data
in the examination of prenatal care adequacy.
They should also lead researchers to recon-
sider the Wpes of visits that should be included
in an evaluation of prenatal care utilization
or, more accurately, an evaluation of care
during pregnancy. For women with chronic
diseases, treatment from a broader set of
providers may contribute to improved birth
outcomes. Z)

ABSTRACT
Objectives. This study sought to
identify characteristics of high-risk
pregnant women that predicted long-
term participation in a home visitation
program.
Methods. Data regarding sociode-
mographic characteristics, perceived
needs, psychological functioning, sub-
stance use, and informal social support
were collected prospectively from 152
short-term and 221 long-term program
participants.
Results. In comparison with short-
term participants, long-term partici-
pants were more likely to have been
African American, married, nonsmok-
ers, and enrolled in the program during
their second trimester of pregnancy,
and they were more likely to have had
emotional and instrumental support
needs.
Conclusions. Women with greater
social support needs and healthier behav-
iors were more receptive to long-term
home visitation than other women. (Am J

Past studies of maternal home visitation
programs have feported attr)tion rates rang-
ing from 5% to 60%.1-4 Although the primary
goal of most honie visitation studies is to
measure programmatic effects on infant mor-
bidity and mortality, investigators often face
difficulties estimating program benefits
when a substantial proportion of women drop
out earlier than expected.
To date, relatively few studies have
focused on examining the characteristics of
women who diol)PL1t of prevention programs
prematurely.5YNone of these studies have
focused on pregnant women at risk for poor
psychosocial functioning, and none are spe-
cific to maternal home visitation programs.
Given the dearth of information concerning
the characteristics of program dropouts and
completers and the applicability of this
knowledge to program planning, the present
study examined associations between
women's sociodemographic characteristics,
perceived needs, psychological functioning,
substance use, and informal social support
networks and their duration of participation
in a North Carolina matemal home visitation
program.

14 /
elsewhe quasi-experimental design
was used to select 373 women who were
enrolled in the program and met the follow-
ing criteria: (l) receipt of maternity care
coordination services, (2) less than 28 weeks
pregnant, and (3) presence of at least one of
several risk factors (i.e., noncompliance in
regard to care, previous poor birth outcome,
adolescent pregnancy, transportation diffi-
culties, inadequate social support, high med-
ical risk, physical abuse, substance abuse,
mental illness, lack of housing, or other
stressful family situations).
Study subjects were classified as short-
term participants if they dropped out of the
program before 10 months after delivery
(n = 152). They were classified as long-term
participants if they remained in the program
for at least 10 months after delivery
(n = 221).

Abstract — In order to build knowledge and to make informed-
decisions regarding childbirth, women need to gather information.
Online resources can play a relevant role to its access, and health
professionals can recommend, support and endorse it. The aim of
this study is to understand the current state of e-health services for
childbirth education provided by the Portuguese I--lealth System.
The data was collected from five portals: a) Portuguese National
Patient Portal; b) Academia project website; c) Portuguese Health
System website; d) Digital Library in Health Literacy; e) SNS24.
Results show that childbirth topics are scarce or inexistent on
those platforms. Only one document was found related to
Pregnancy, with four pages regarding Childbirth, which were
analysed according to the topics coverage, organisation, approach,
and visual presentation. The results show that there is room for
novel initiatives on e-health to promote childbirth education in
Portugal.

INTRODUCÄO
The emergence of Electronic Health can be associated with
the usage of informatics systems and services in healthcare, not
only by health professionals, but also by the general public. E-
Health outline can be established when information and
communication technology is used in order to be a valuable
resource to improve health care, and, on a broader sense, when
users of digital devices access healthcare information as well as
useful services and tools that promote a healthy living by helping
them to manage their own health and wellness [l].
Pregnant women have been using digital technologies for
information and support [2], with differentiated uses according
to successive digital technology eras. They usually search for
information in pregnancy related to websites and blogs, and
interacted through discussion forums [3], [4]. More recently,
with the advent of diverse new digital media (as social web and
mobile ubiquitous computing devices), they expanded even
more their usage [5]. According to Tripp et al. [6], by
downloading informative data, pregnant women end up reducing
the frequency of visits to the hospital, since their anxiety levels
dropped, and they could understand their own conditions.
It is during the antenatal care appointments that health
professionals have the opportunity to mitigate women's
concerns and anxiety related to the pregnancy process and to
prepare them for the childbirth and postpartum [7]. One of the
healthcare professionals' responsibilities [8], [9] is to support

expectant parents to better distinguish which resources are
trustworthy, containing reliable and up-to-date information, and
which ones should be ignored, since it is imperative to separate
facts from fiction by clarifying popular and problematic
discourses around pregnancy, labour, birth and the unbom [10],
As reinforcement tools, there are specific digital materials
that could be used to help clarifying definitions, and to
demonstrate the process and explain interventions: ranging from
e-books, digital illustrations, photos and videos, to sum up to the
conventional printed-based approach of handling brochures and
booklets [11], [12], [13].
A study [2] from 2013 already highlighted the importance of
websites run by health professionals (e.g.: Mayo Clinic),
governmental websites, and, medicine research sources (e.g.:
Pub-Med). The majority of participants in the survey suggested
that the healthcare providers should recommend suitable Internet
sites for the purpose of: adding information to the one provided
during the appointments; gaining more control over their
decisions related to pregnancy; and raising their confidence for
talking to the health professionals about their concerns.
This study aims to analyse the current state of e-Health
services and digital information provided by the Portuguese
National Health System (Sistema Nacional de Saüde - SNS), that
could be pointed out by health professionals to contribute for
childbirth knowledge, in particular related to labour and birth
topics. This study is part of an ongoing PhD research to deepen
knowledge on the role that digital media could have to support
the informed-decision making process [14], by providing
educational resources that clarify the best practices
recommended by the World Health Organization [15].
II. METHODS
The first step of this study aimed at exploiting the
organisation of the Portuguese National Health System in order
to support the process of sources selection. To avoid leaving
behind any of the portals that could contain relevant childbirth
information, a web search procedure was conducted, and the
following sources provided by SNS were selected: a) Portuguese
National Patient Portal: https://servicos.min-saude.pt/utente/; b)
Academia Project: http://academia.spms.min-saude.pt/; c) SNS

resources could contribute: to guarantee the women's and
partner free access to information early through the different
SNS Portals, or from a specialized one, namely the Digital
Health Library; to support expectant parents from different
settings with up-to-date childbirth education; to boost online
classes; to support digital interventions for prevention; to
encourage autonomy and auto-determination, and to support the
women with the Birth Plan creation.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Objective: Medication abortion (MAB) is safe and effective up to 77 days gestation. Limited data are
available on how often patients are ineligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age and how many of
those ineligible go on to receive procedural abortion.
Study design: Retrospective analysis of electronic health records from Planned Parenthood of the Pacific
Southwest (PPPSW) from January - December 2021. PPPSW has four procedural abortion sites and 15 MAB-
only clinics that offered appointments only if last menstrual period-based GA was days or unknown.
Patients > 70 days gestation by intake ultrasound at a MAB-only clinic were referred to a procedural center.
Results: Of 11,684 patients presenting for MAB at MAB-only sites 2224 (19%) did not receive a MAB; 3.8%
(N = 444) presented past 70 days gestation and were thus ineligible due to gestational age limits. Of those
ineligible (N = 444), 234 (53%) measured between 71-77 days of gestation. Three quarters (75.7%) of those
ineligible went on to receive a procedural abortion at PPPSW after a mean wait time of 10 days. In multi-
variable analysis, no demographic factors were associated with higher odds of receiving a procedural
abortion.
Conclusions: Presenting for MAB past a gestational age limit was uncommon, supporting safety of no-test
MAB protocols. A quarter of people ineligible for MAB due to gestational age did not receive a procedural
abortion at PPPSW. If MAB were offered up to 77 days, half of patients who were denied MAB due to
gestational age could have received MAB, expanding patient access.
Implications: Being ineligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age was uncommon. Increasing MAB
gestational age limits from 70 days to 77 days could further improve abortion access.

Access to abortion services is increasingly under threat. Efforts to
improve access have included expansion of medication abortion
(MAB) services into new practice settings, leading to increases in the
number of non-hospital facilities that provide MAB II . Not all clinics
that provide MAB have the necessary trained providers or facilities
to also offer procedural abortion. As of 2020, 31% of abortion clinic
facilities in the United States only provided MAB 2]. For instance, in

the Planned Parenthood of the Pacific Southwest (PPPSW) system,
most clinics can provide medication abortion, but must provide re-
ferrals to one of four procedural sites when patients do not meet
eligibility criteria for medication abortion. While many pregnant
individuals have an accurate estimation of their gestational age, a
2014 systematic review demonstrated between 2.5-11.8% of people
eligible for MAB based on last menstrual period (LMP) are found to
be ineligible based on ultrasound dating
[3-5].
Given that the effectiveness of MAB decreases with increasing
weeks gestation, current FDA approval includes provision of medi-
cation abortion up to 70 days gestation
However, current evi-
dence suggests medication abortion offered up to 77 days gestation
dated by history-based LMP results in a similar success rate, and
both this gestational limit and history-based screening are sup-
ported by the National Abortion Federation
[7-9].
Research sur-
veying people presenting at abortion clinics that offered both
medication and procedural abortion services demonstrated that 41%
preferred MAB, but about one third of the patients who preferred

MAB were beyond 70 days gestation
[101.
However, it is unknown
how frequently people present beyond 70 days gestation at MAB-
only clinics and whether these patients are able to follow through on
referrals to sites offering procedural services.
Assessing outcomes for people who are ineligible for MAB based
on gestational age and must be referred provides important nuance
to our understanding of systemic barriers to abortion care. It also
informs discussion of the optimal days gestation up to which med-
ication abortion should be offered and the implications of omitting
dating ultrasounds prior to MAB, which are particularly relevant
given the recent rise of both no-test MAB protocols and self-man-
aged MAB. In a unique cohort of patients who did not receive a MAB
after presenting for one at a MAB-only Planned Parenthood filiate
clinic, we sought to: (1 ) determine frequency of being ineligible for
medication abortion due to > 70 days gestation, (2) characterize
frequency and duration of delays in care among patients who did not
receive same-day MAB, and (3) estimate the number of people who
could have received a MAB if gestational age limits were raised to
77 days.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Definition of sample
Patients included in the study did not receive a MAB after pre-
senting for MAB at a PPPSW clinic that does not offer procedural
abortion services from January 1 through December 31, 2021 (Fig. 1)
The PPPSW system has 19 clinics, 15 of which offer only MAB, one of
which offers only procedural abortion, and three of which offer both
MAB and procedural abortion. Patients scheduling a MAB appoint-
ment (either online or by telephone) provide a date of LMP, and are
able to schedule a MAB appointment only if their estimated days
gestation at the time of scheduling is under 71 days. If they have an
uncertain LMP, they are directed to call for an appointment and are
allowed to schedule at a MAB-only clinic, but receive counseling that
they may need a procedural abortion if they are beyond 70 days
gestation on intake ultrasound. If a patient is ineligible for MAB after
intake ultrasound at a MAB-only clinic, they are referred to and
scheduled at a procedural location for a later date. At the time of the
study, MAB was only provided to patients presenting at 70 days
gestation or less by ultrasound. Affiate policy allowed for the pro-
vision of MAB in patients with a pregnancy of unknown location on
ultrasound if the patient was asymptomatic (no vaginal bleeding or
abdominal pain) and had no other risk factors for ectopic pregnancy.
The study was reviewed and deemed exempt by the Institutional
Review Board at University of California, San Diego.
2.2. Primary variables of interest
All patients received a clinic-administered urine pregnancy test
and transvaginal ultrasound at their MAB appointment, unless their
in-clinic pregnancy test was negative. Ultrasound findings were used
to determine type of pregnancy including (1 ) Intrauterine pregnancy
(ultrasound had a clear intrauterine yolk sac and/or fetal pole), (2)
Pregnancy of Unknown Location (PUL) (positive pregnancy test
without a definitive intrauterine pregnancy), (3) Possible Molar
Pregnancy, and (4) Early Pregnancy Loss (EPL) (anembryonic preg-
nancy, complete abortion, retained products of conception, in-
trauterine fetal demise, or incomplete abortion). Confirmed ectopic
pregnancies were not included in the sample. Gestational age vari-
ables included both patient-reported last menstrual period as well
as ultrasound measurement of fetal pole or gestational sac. Receipt
of a procedural abortion after initial MAB visit was determined by
review of medical records from PPPSW procedural centers. In order
to account for incomplete follow-up for those who had their initial
MAB visit at the end of the study period, analysis of the receipt of
Contraception xxx (xxxx) xxx
procedural abortion was restricted to patients who had their initial
MAB visit before September 25, 2021. Thus, this cohort was followed
until at least 24 weeks gestation (legal limit of abortion in
California).
2.3. Demographic variables
Data on race and ethnicity were collapsed into larger categories
for ease of analysis. Categories provided in the clinical records in-
cluded white, African American/Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latinx. In
addition, an "Other" category was created which included patients
who identified their race as Filipino, multi-racial, Middle Eastern,
Native American, Pacific Islander, and other. Patient age was re-
ported in number of years and was analyzed as a continuous vari-
able. Patient state of residence was collapsed into two categories: (1 )
"In-state" for those residing in California and (2) "out of state" for
those from all other states or outside of the United States. Type of
payment for the medication abortion visit was reported as Medi-Cal
(California-based Medicaid), commercial insurance, or self-pay.
2.4. Data analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated comparing those who
presented for MAB prior to versus after 70 days gestation by ultra-
sound. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to de-
termine which demographic factors were associated with odds of
receiving a procedural abortion among those who presented for a
MAB visit but were ineligible due to being beyond 70 days gestation
by ultrasound. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to
estimate adjusted odds ratios. Covariates thought likely to influence
whether patients were able to follow up after being denied MAB
were included in the multivariable model (age, race/ethnicity, pay-
ment type, and ultrasound-based days gestation at presentation).
Alpha was set at 0.05 for all regression models. Analysis was per-
formed using Stata statistical software, v18 (Stata Corp, College
Station, TX).
3. Results
3.1. Sample characteristics
Of the 11,684 patients who presented for MAB at a MAB-only site,
2224 (19%) did not receive a MAB. Of these 2224 patients, 1300
(58.5%) had an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP), 453 (20.4%) had a PUL,
30 (1.3%) had EPL, 13 (0.6%) had a possible molar pregnancy, 131
(5.9%) had a negative pregnancy test, and 297 (13.4%) had missing
ultrasound findings (Fig. 1 Thirty-six patients with IUP had missing
ultrasound-based gestational age and were thus excluded from fur-
ther analyses (
). Among our sample of patients presenting for

MAB with a visualized IUP (N = 1264), the average patient age was
27.4 years and the majority identified as either white (31.7%), His-
panic/Latinx (24.1%), or African American/Black (10.2%) (Table 1)
The vast majority resided in California (98.3%) and most were in-
sured by Medi-Cal (66.6%) (Table 1). The majority (75.8%) of patients
had dating by LMP of less than 70 days, though 14.8% were beyond
70 days by LMP at the time of the MAB appointment despite clinic
screening practices (Table 1 ). When comparing dating by LMP versus
ultrasound, 15.1% had LMP dating within 3 days of ultrasound dating,
15.8% had a 4-7 days discrepancy, 16.7% had a 8-14 days dis-
crepancy, 22.1% had a 15-28 days discrepancy, and 30.4% had > 29-
day discrepancy (Fig. 2).

Of patients who were found to have an IUP and had documented
ultrasound-based gestational age (N = 1264), 444 (35.1%) presented

those presenting past 70 days gestation by ultrasound with docu-
mented LMP (N = 1144), 271 (69.1%) had LMP dating of < 70 days
(Table 1). Assuming all patients who received a MAB in 2021 were
< 70 days gestation, overall incidence of MAB-ineligibility at MAB-
only clinics due to gestational age limit of 70 days was 3.8% (444
patients out of the total 11,684 who presented at MAB-only sites).
Using the same assumption, 2.0% of all patients at MAB-only clinics
were between 71-77 days gestation by ultrasound.
3.3. Follow-up after MAB ineligibility
Further analysis was restricted to patients who presented for a
MAB visit prior to September 25, 2021 to allow for identification of
procedural abortion occurring up to 24 weeks gestation (legal limit
in California) by the study end date (N = 350). Among this cohort of

days gestation by clinic intake ultrasound during visit for medication abortion at a
medication abortion-only clinic among patients who had an intrauterine pregnancy
but did not go on to receive a medication abortion (N = 1098). Grey lines demarcate 71
days gestation. Each data point represents one patient in the sample. Patients with

patients ineligible for MAB due to > 70 days gestation, 265 (75.7%)
received a procedural abortion at PPPSW. About half (43.4%) of pa-
tients received a procedural abortion within a week of their initial
MAB appointment and only one-sixth (14.3%) of patients waited
more than two weeks between MAB visit and procedural abortion.
Average wait time between MAB visit and abortion procedure was 10
days. All procedural abortion visits within the PPPSW system oc-
curred within 78 days of initial MAB visit. One quarter (26.4%) of
these patients required a second trimester abortion procedure (> 97
days gestation). Neither age, race, in-state residence, insurance/

payment type, nor number of days past gestational age limit were
significantly associated with the odds of receiving a procedural
abortion after MAB ineligibility in univariate or multivariable ana-
lysis (
Table 2)
4. Discussion
We explored eligibility for MAB based on gestational age and
found that 3.8% of all patients presenting for MAB at a MAB-only
clinic were past the clinic gestational age limit of 70 days by ultra-
sound, despite clinic screening that offered appointments only to
patients < 70 days gestation by LMP. Of patients who were not eli-
gible to receive a MAB due to gestational age, the majority went on
to receive a procedural abortion (75.7%) and most (85.7%) within two
weeks of their initial MAB appointment.
Medication abortion is safe and effective up to 77 days gestation
[11-131
, with some research supporting high effcacy even beyond
77 days
We found that 2% of all patients presenting at MAB-
only sites were between 71-77 days gestational age. Importantly,
over half of patients in our study ineligible due to gestational age
limit would have been eligible if MAB were offered up to 77 days.
Given this, offering MAB up to 77 days could improve clinic oper-
ating effciency and patient access to care. However, these benefits
are more likely to be realized if patients with estimated gestation
between 71-77 days are not scheduled at MAB-only clinics. Of note,
since this study was completed the study site implemented a prac-
tice change to allow MAB provision up to 77 days gestation. Patients
with dating by LMP up to 77 days are now able to schedule at MAB-
only clinics.
A notable proportion (26%) of the 350 patients who were in-
eligible for MAB due to advanced gestational age did not later re-
ceive a procedural abortion at PPPSW. Geographic, financial,
political, and logistical barriers can prevent patients from acting on
referrals and accessing follow-up care
[15-181.
For instance, it is
possible some patients who traveled long distances to Southern
California for a MAB were unable to return at a later time for a
surgical abortion. However, it is unknown based on available data
what percentage of patients desired a procedural abortion but faced
barriers arranging follow-up versus decided they no longer desired
pregnancy termination or sought pregnancy termination at a site
outside PPPSW. Further research via patient interviews or surveys
would be useful in answering these questions and seeking solutions
to barriers that prevent patients from obtaining desired care.
Increased focus and research on "no-test" medication abortion
protocols that don't require an ultrasound was driven by the
Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Our findings, including the
overall low incidence of presentation beyond 70 days and relatively
high accuracy of history-based dating when compared to ultrasound,
are in line with prior research that has shown no-test protocols are
safe and effective without a preceding ultrasound to confirm dating
A prior study conducted at another Planned Parenthood filiate
found that medical management of PUL results in sooner diagnosis
of ectopic pregnancy than expectant management
[21]
. Despite this,
we found that a significant number of patients that did not receive a
planned MAB had a pregnancy of unknown location. This population
likely contains patients who were symptomatic (vaginal bleeding,
abdominal pain) and thus not eligible for MAB. Our data did not
allow for stratification by symptoms and our study was not designed
to determine frequency of MAB provision for patients with PUL, but
these findings suggest further research is needed to understand
current trends in the implementation of MAB for PUL.
Strengths of our study include the large sample size and inclu-
Sion of multiple different clinical sites that were unified under a

consistent clinical protocol. However, our findings should be con-
sidered in light of several limitations. We relied on health record
data which did not allow us to determine why patients did not go on
to receive a procedural abortion. In addition, the generalizability of
our results is limited as the study only included Planned Parenthood
filiate clinics in Southern California and was conducted during the
COVID-19 pandemic. Differing screening policies within other clinic
systems are likely to impact the frequency with which patients
present for MAB past gestational age limits.
Overall, our study demonstrated that within a large family
planning clinic system, a significant portion of patients who pre-
sented for MAB and did not receive one were ineligible based on a
gestational age limit for MAB care. If the gestational age limit for
MAB had been increased to 77 days during the study period, the
majority of these patients would have been eligible for MAB at their
initial visit. In a system with a robust referral structure, most pa-
tients ineligible for MAB by gestational age ended up receiving a
procedural abortion with a reasonable wait time, but further re-
search is needed to understand if this holds true in other areas and
health systems.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Child malnutrition is a significant public health concern in several developing countries. Evidence suggests
that family size and children's health outcomes are correlated. We utilize data from the National Family
Health Survey (NFHS-5) for India and employ an Instrumental Variable approach to examine the impact
of limiting fertility through the use of contraceptives on child health. Exploiting the exogenous variation in
district average of women's exposure to family-planning messages, we estimate that contraception leads to
a 1.45 (0.47) SD increase in a child's height-for-age (weight-for-age) z-scores and reduces the likelihood of
stunting (being underweight) by 17.9 (10.9) pp. We provide support to the resource-dilution hypothesis as
our potential mechanism, highlighting that an exogenous increase in household size, explained by multiple or
twin births, depletes children's health. Our findings underscore the benefits of exposure to family-planning for
child health and the need for targeted policies focusing on access to (and use of) contraceptives.
Child malnutrition is a rising and persistent issue affecting most
of the low and middle-income countries across the globe. As of 2020,
the World Health Organization (2021) estimates suggest that 149 mil-
lion children under 5 years of age are stunted, 45 million are wasted,
and 38.9 million are overweight. Aside from having a long-lasting phys-
iological effect on children, undernutrition has also been linked to poor
mental development, lower academic performance and behavioral ab-
normalities (Martins et al., 2011; Dercon and Sånchez, 2013
). Besides,
undernutrition has significant economic consequences through loss of
human capital and productivity, perpetuating poverty and abating the
development of nations.
Shekhar et al. (2006) and
World Food Pro-
gramme Report (2013) observe that the economic cost of malnutrition
can range from 2%—3% of a country's GDP to as high as 17% in the most
severely impacted countries. For India, in particular, child malnutrition
has been a chronic problem. India slipped in its ranks from 94 to 107
out of 121 countries as per the Global Hunger Index, 2022. Despite

decades of investments and interventions, India continues to be home
to a third of the world's stunted children and one-half of all under-5
mortality is attributable to undernutrition.
There is substantial evidence that children from larger families
with more siblings and higher birth orders have poorer health, human
capital outcomes, and cognitive development.
Blake (1981), Horton
(1986), Silles (2010), Booth and Kee (2009), Desai (1995), Knodel
et al. (1990
). These findings rely largely on the seminal quantity—
quality (QQ) trade-off of children or the resource dilution hypothesis,
which emphasizes the scarcity of parental time and physical resources
per child as the family grows (Becker, 1960; Becker and Lewis, 1973,
Becker and Tomes, 1976; Doepke, 2015; Chen, 2021; Li et al., 2008;
Dang and Rogers, 2016; Mogstad and Wiswall, 2016). Thus, one can
plausibly expect that limiting fertility rates may lead to greater atten-
tion, care and resource allocation towards existing children. With this
in mind, in this paper, we examine the impacts of limiting fertility
through the use of contraceptives on child health for India.

in Mumbai, which is overseen by the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare (MoHFW), Government of India. 4 The sample is drawn using
stratified random sampling.5
We use the individual women's and children's data from NFHS-
5. Individual women's data consists of one record for every eligible
woman in the reproductive age of 15 and 49 years and collects infor-
mation about her background characteristics, health knowledge, health
behaviors, fertility patterns, child's health and nutritional status, as well
as household characteristics. We restrict the women's data to include
women married only once to ensure that the woman's responses about
contraceptive use pertain to her current union.
The children's data consists of one record for every child of the in-
terviewed woman born up to five years preceding the survey. It collects
information on both demographic and anthropometric characteristics of
children between the ages of O to 59 months. We merge the two data
sets, and our unit of analysis is the children born to women in the last
five years. Our final sample consists of 219,254 observations.
2.2. Measurement of child nutritional status
NFHS-5 contains information on the nutritional status of children
under the age of 5. For our baseline analysis, we measure child health
with their anthropometric measures of nutritional surveillance, viz.
height-for-age z-score (HAZ), and weight-for-age z-score (WAZ). These
anthropometric measures are calculated for children under 5 by their
age and sex, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) Standard Deviation-derived Growth Reference Curves, which are
derived from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)/CDC
Reference Population (Le and Nguyen, 2020). Child's anthropometric
measures reflect the nutrition and growth status of children in both the
long run and the short run (Thomas et al., 1991; WHO, 2008
). These
anthropometric measures are described as the number of standard
deviations below or above the median of the international reference
population.

2.3. Contraceptive use
The survey also provides information on a couple's contraceptive
use. Specifically, the respondents are asked, "have you ever used any-
thing or tried to avoid or delay getting pregnant?". Here, the contra-
ceptive methods may include using a contraceptive pill, injections,
IUD, condoms, sterilization, rhythmic/periodic abstinence, withdrawal,
lactational amenorrhea, foam/jelly, female condom and standard days
method. We do not differentiate between the methods of contraception
and define our variable of interest as Everused such that it takes value
1 if the couple has ever used any of these contraceptive methods or
tried to delay pregnancy and O otherwise.

6 The assignment of the z-scores based on the WHO Child Growth Standards
is done through a complicated interpolation function that takes into account
sex, age (measured by the difference in date of birth and date of interview,
both precise to the day of the month), height in centimeters, and weight in
kilograms (precise to 100 grams). The z-scores are calculated using software
based on the WHO Anthro program and the macros for statistical packages at
http://www.who.int/childgrowth/software/en/.

bias and that 'the most straightforward approach to such concerns
is to include controls that can be observed', we incorporate a va-
riety of child, woman, and household controls chosen carefully and
comprehensively in our baseline estimations. Our child level controls
include birth order, whether the child is a twin/multiple birth, the
child's birth size, age, sex, and whether the child has received polio,
BCG, DPT and measles vaccinations. The mother's controls include
age, education level, and body mass index (BMI) to incorporate a
measure of her general health status, whether she is covered by health
insurance, intake of iron supplements during pregnancy, and frequency
of antenatal visits during pregnancy. Household level controls include
wealth index, indicators of residence in a rural or urban area, indicators
for religion (Hindu, Muslim, Christian or other religions including Sikh,
Jain, Buddhist and others), and caste (Backward or other).
2.5. Descriptive patterns — analytical sample
Our analytical sample consists of 219,254 observations.
Table 1
presents the descriptive statistics of the variables used in our analysis.
Mean HAZ is at —1.30 standard deviations (SD), and mean WAZ is at
—1.39 SD. Our variable of interest, Everused suggests that almost 77%
percent of women have used some contraceptive method.8
In terms of child demographics, roughly 48.2% (50.8%) of the
sample consists of girls (boys), and the average age of a child is
approximately 29.6 months. Only about 2.5% of the children are twins
or belonged to a multiple birth, and approximately 89.8% of children
are average or above in size at birth. Approximately 83% of children
have received the polio vaccination, 85% have the DPT vaccinations
and 94% (53%) the BCG (measles) vaccinations.
An average woman's age is approximately 27 years; 78% have
completed primary education, and approximately 27% of women are
covered by health insurance. On average, around 87.5% of women
received some iron supplements during pregnancy and had roughly 5
antenatal visits during pregnancy to the healthcare center.
Demographics at the household level suggest that an average house-
hold in our analytical sample belongs to the poor-to-middle income
category in terms of wealth index.9 Roughly 80 percent of the house-
holds reside in rural areas, approximately 83.5% are backward castes,
and the majority (74%) are Hindus.
3. Empirical framework
3.1. Estimation strategy
We use the following empirical specification to investigate the effect
of a couple's contraceptive use on the HAZ and WAZ of children:
(1)
where Yi refers to the outcome of interest (HAZ or WAZ) of child i;
Everusedi denotes an indicator variable equal to 1 if child i's parents
have ever used contraceptive measures and O otherwise; Xi is the vector
of child-specific controls; Mi is the vector of child i's mother's char-
is the vector of child i's household controls; As denotes
acteristics;
state fixed effects. Our parameter of interest, 131 captures the effect of
the couple's use of contraception on their child's health outcomes. All
standard errors are clustered at the survey cluster level.
7 Oster (2019) also suggests that if a coefficient is stable after the inclusion
of the observed controls, this can be taken as a sign that the omitted variable
bias is limited. We also provide robustness of our baseline results with the
inclusion of additional controls in Section
6.3.
8 Note that 56% of women have used some contraceptive method in the
NFHS-4 sample for the years 2015—16. We use the NFHS-4 data in the
robustness Section
6.5.
9
Our measure of wealth is based on the wealth index provided by DHS,
which is a standardized measure of household economic status in a given
survey. The households are divided into poorest, poor, middle, richer and
richest households by the DHS.

Notes: The sample is restricted to women married only once. The data provides information on all children,
aged below 5 years, born to surveyed women. Mother's BMI is a categorical variable ranging from O for
underweight to 3 for obese The HH wealth index is a composite measure of a household's cumulative
living standard and ranges from 1 (poorest) to 5 (richest). "Backward" is a binary indicator of whether the
household belongs to the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe or other backward classes or not.
3.2. Identification strateu
To alleviate concerns of bias caused by omitted variables, our
estimation technique incorporates a comprehensive set of controls.
We additionally account for any systematic state-level unobservables
that may affect contraceptive use by including state-fixed effects. But
because numerous unobservables could be linked with both Everusedi
and Yi, the problem with the estimation of Eq.
(1) is that Everusedi
might be endogenous. A causal interpretation of [31 would demand that
there be no unobserved factors that are correlated with both Everusedi
and Yi, conditional on our controls. Concerns about endogeneity may
also arise if causality runs from the child's nutritional outcome to
Everusedi. For instance, the nutritional status of older children may
influence the couple's usage of contraceptives for subsequent pregnan-
cies. Additionally, since Everusedi is self-reported, measurement error
in the variable could result in endogeneity. The OLS estimate of [31
would be biased and inconsistent as a result of these issues. In order
to determine the impact of the use of contraceptive measures on the
anthropometrics measures, HAZ and WAZ, we thus utilize an IV-TSLS
10
technique.
To construct our instrument, we use data on family planning mes-
sages from mass media sources like radio, television, and newspapers.
First, we define a binary variable that takes the value 1 if the woman
has heard about family planning either on the radio or TV or newspaper
and O otherwise. Each household in our sample receives a binary

contraceptive use on child health. For brevity, we do not include those results
in the paper. The results are available upon request.
indicator of media exposure as a result. We then create a district average
of media exposure to generate our instrument. We contend that the
couple's usage of contraceptives is inextricably linked to the average
exposure of women to family planning messages through mass media.
11
This is consistent with a significant body of research that demonstrates
how information conveyed through mass media programmes can in-
crease the use of family planning and alter reproductive behavior (Jah
et al., 2014; Agha and Van Rossem, 2002; Gupta et al., 2003; Olenick,

of interest, Everusedi. Note that there is a strong positive correlation
between them.
Besides, conditional on the controls, the only channel through
which district-average media exposure to family planning messages
would affect child i's nutritional status is through actual family plan-
ning/reproductive practices of the parents. Thus, we assert that our IV
is compelling in that it not only has a strong correlation with our key
variable of interest, Everusedi, but also does not have a direct effect
on HAZ and WAZ. Further, while including state fixed effects allays
11
We use a district-level IV instead of a woman's own exposure to such
information as we believe that taking the district average makes the IV more
exogenous in nature than her own media exposure. A woman's own media
exposure may be more highly correlated with several household-level unob-
servables such as intra-marital bargaining, access to household resources as
well as autonomy and relative position in the household. These unobservables
plausibly have a direct impact on the health outcomes of children in that
household, thus threatening the validity of household level IV. Moreover, own
media exposure is self-reported and may suffer from measurement error. As
such, considering district averages reduces the measurement error making it
more appropriate as an IV and valid conditional on observables.

z-score. These are standardized anthropometric measures based on the WHO Child Growth Standards and range from —6 SD to +6 SD. The
main explanatory variable is a binary indicator taking the value 1 if the couple has ever used any kind of contraceptive method and O

being correlated to the IV, given that our IV uses district-level variation,
we control for omitted variables at the district level in the robustness
Section 6.3. Once we condition on district-level characteristics along
with our basic set of controls, the average exposure of women in a
district to family planning messages over mass-media indeed affects
child health only through the actual family planning practices.

Table 2
presents the IV-TSLS results of the effect of contraceptive
use on HAZ and WAZ. Columns (1) to (3) present the estimates for
the effect on HAZ, and columns (4) to (6) present the estimates for
WAZ, respectively. Columns (1) and (4) capture the initial association
between a couple's use of contraception on their child's HAZ and WAZ,
respectively, with no controls. Absent any controls, on average, the
effect of contraceptive use increases HAZ (WAZ) of children by 2.2
(1.6) standard deviations (SD). Both these coefficients are statistically
significant at 1% level of significance. As we move across to columns
(2) and (5), we add the mother's characteristics, the child's charac-
teristics as well as household characteristics. Adding comprehensive
controls to our specifications reduces the number of observations to
a large extent. We continue to find a statistically significant increase
in the child's HAZ and WAZ, respectively, as a result of contraceptive
use. Finally, we also include state fixed effects as additional controls
in columns (3) and (6). Estimates from columns (3) and (6) capture
our most preferred specification. Column (3) shows that the decision
to use contraception increases the child's HAZ by 1.4 SD on average.
From column (6), we note that the child's WAZ increases by 0.47 SD
if the couple has ever used any form of contraception. The coefficients

Our instrument is the district
average media exposure of women to family planning information. This is created by
taking a district-wide average of a binary indicator that takes the value 1 if woman i
has been exposed to family planning related information on the TV, radio or newspaper
and O otherwise. The sample is restricted to women married only once. Standard errors

controls and with state fixed effects added sequentially. We note a
positive and statistically significant relationship between the couple's
use of contraceptives and the district average of women's exposure to
family planning through mass-media. More specifically, the probability
of couples using contraception increases by 27.7 pp with the rise in the
district average of women's exposure. Our model fairs remarkably well
in terms of diagnostic tests that assess the efficiency and reliability of
the IV. The weak identification and under-identification test statistics

Columns (3) and (6), respectively. the F-statistic is also well above 10
across all our specifications, implying that our instrument is strong.
The Kleibergen Paap rk-LM statistic of 274.3 and 270.4 for HAZ and
WAZ, respectively, allows us to reject the null that the instrument is
uncorrelated with the endogenous regressor. This indicates that our
instrument is relevant and correlated with the endogenous regressor.
5. Extensions
5.1. Modern methods of contraception
Here, we extend our baseline analysis with the aim of specifically
examining the effect of using modern methods of contraceptives on the
HAZ and WAZ scores. Typically, to easily categorize family planning
methods, modern contraceptive methods are defined as any product or
medical procedure that interferes with reproduction from acts of sexual
intercourse (Hubacher and Trussell, 2015). Following this definition,
for our data, this includes pills, IUD, injections, diaphragms, male
condoms, female condoms, female and male sterilization, foam or jelly
and emergency contraception. Traditional methods of contraception
consist of periodic abstinence, withdrawal, other traditional methods,
lactational amenorrhea and standard days method. First, we study the
effect of modern contraception methods versus traditional methods or
not using contraceptives. Second, we examine the impact of modern
methods of contraceptives versus not using any contraception. Third,
we look at the effect of traditional methods of contraceptives versus no

presents the results. Columns (1) and (4) provide the results
Table 4
for the regressions where our variable of interest is coded as 1 if the
13 We also examine the effect of using modern versus traditional contracep-
tives on child health for the subsample that reports using contraceptives. We
find a positive and statistically significant impact of using modern methods
over traditional on a child's HAZ (WAZ) scores by 9.9 (3.7) SD. However, the
IV does not perform well on the specification tests and thus warrants caution
in interpreting these results as causal.
Economic Modelling 129 (2023) 106562
couple has only ever used modern contraceptive methods and O if
they use traditional or no contraceptives. The results are statistically
significant, and we document an increase in the HAZ (WAZ) scores
by 1.55 (0.51) SD. Columns (2) and (5) present the results where the
endogenous variable takes the value 1 if the couples use only modern
contraceptives and O otherwise, excluding those using traditional con-
traceptive methods. Again, we note that the effects are largely robust
and similar. HAZ (WAZ) increases by 1.15 (0.32) SD if the couples use
modern methods relative to not using any contraception method. From
column (3) and (6), we find evidence that if couples use traditional
methods of contraception, it leads to a rise in the HAZ (WAZ) score of
the child by 1.24 (0.46) SD. Our IV fairs well in the specification tests.
5.2. Other measures of nutritional deficiencies: Stunting and underweight
Further, we measure the effect of contraceptive use on other mea-
sures of child nutritional status. Specifically, we focus on stunting
and underweight indicators. Stunting, based on a child's height and
age, is considered a measure of chronic nutritional deficiency. Under-
weight, on the other hand, is based on a child's weight and age and
is considered a composite measure of both acute and chronic nutritional
). Stunting typically results from long-term
statuses (
Croft et al., 2018
nutrition deprivation and leads to delayed mental development and
reduced intellectual capacity, while being underweight significantly
increases the mortality risk.
We consider both stunting and underweight as binary variables for
our analysis. Stunted takes the value 1 if the child is moderately or
severely stunted and O if the child is not stunted. Our measure of
underweight similarly takes the value 1 if the child is moderately or
acutely underweight and O otherwise.14 More specifically,
O(not stunted),
if H AZ > -2
Stuntedi =
I (moderately/acutely stunted), if HAZ —2
Underweighti
O(not underweight),
if w AZ e (-2,21
I (moderately/acutely underweight), if WAZ —2
Given that our outcomes here, stunted or underweight, are binary in
nature, as well as our variable of interest everused, we utilize Roodman
2011)'s conditional mixed-processes (CMP) framework as our IV esti-
mation approach. We present the results in
Columns (1)—(3)
Table 5.
present the marginal effects for Stunted, and columns (4) — (7) present
the same for Underweight without controls, with controls and with fixed
effects added subsequently.
Examining our most preferred specification, including comprehen-
Sive controls and fixed effects for Stuntedi in column (3), we note that
if a couple uses contraception, the probability that the child is stunted
decreases statistically significantly by 17.9 percentage points (pp). As
we move to Underweighti, we note a negative and statistically signifi-
cant effect of contraceptive use on the probability of the child being
underweight (see column (6)); the likelihood of being underweight
decreases by 10.9 pp.
In summary, our results for the measures of chronic and acute nutri-
tional deficiencies confirm our baseline results on HAZ and WAZ. The
negative effects of a couple's contraceptive use on a child being stunted
or underweight corroborate the effects we find on the anthropometric
measures.
14 Children whose weight-for-age z-score (WAZ) is more than 2 SD above the
mean as per WHO Child Growth standards are categorized as overweight for
age. Since we are looking at nutritional deficiency, we only consider whether
or not a child is underweight/stunted as our main outcome variables. We also
ran the analysis for the overweight category and found that contraceptive use
can lead to a slight increase in the likelihood of being overweight. Results can
be made available upon request.

6. Robustness
6.1. Falsification analysis
So far, our findings indicate a positive and statistically significant
effect of a couple's use of contraception on their child's anthropometric
measures for nutrition surveillance. Here, we aim to demonstrate that
such a result cannot be reached using any randomly assigned HAZ and
WAZ outcomes. To accomplish this, we maintain the first stage link
between our endogenous regressor and our instrument while randomly
rearranging our outcome variables. In other words, we associate a ran-
dom child j's HAZ and WAZ scores to the use of contraception by child
i's parents instrumented by the district average of women's exposure to
contraceptive methods through mass-media. Ceteris paribus this makes
the association between our dependent variables and the regressors in
our estimation random.
We replicate this analysis 100 times and show that 93% (96%) of
the times, there is no significant impact of the use of contraceptives on
the randomly assigned HAZ (WAZ) measure at 5% level significance.
To be precise, we are unable to reject the null that the effect of
the use of contraceptives is equal to zero 7 (4) out of 100 times
for HAZ (WAZ). Fig. 2
plots the t-statistics obtained corresponding to
the coefficients of contraceptive use on both HAZ and WAZ in each
of the 100 replications. This falsification test reveals that repeated
estimations with random assignments of contraception choice do not
produce significant results on children's anthropometric measures, and
thus, we are unable to falsify our baseline estimates.
6.2. Household level sample
We estimate our preferred baseline specifications using data at the
individual child level, where we consider multiple children per couple
and household. A worry with this level of analysis is that, given our data
limitations, we only know if the couple has ever used any contraception
method. We are unable to determine when the couple may have used
contraceptives or which pregnancy did it delay or affect. In addition,
since the number of children per couple can vary, households with
more children repeat themselves in the data more than households with
one or fewer children in the analysis at the child level. To address these
potential concerns and check the sensitivity of our baseline results,
we also estimate our desired impacts using aggregated household-level
15
data. For every household, we look at the average child characteristics
15 Instead of controlling for birth order and multiple births, we now control
for the total number of sons and the total number of daughters in the
household

presents our preferred baseline estimates for HAZ and WAZ
Table 6
using the household-level data. From columns (1) and (2), we note
that a couple's use of contraceptives increases the average HAZ of
their children by approximately 1.32 SD and the average WAZ by
0.33 SD, respectively. Comparing these magnitudes to our baseline
estimates reported in columns (3) and (6) in
we find that our
Table 2,
results are substantially robust. The impacts are statistically significant
at the aggregated household level as well, and the magnitudes are
comparable. Our instrument continues to perform well at the household
level, with the weak and under-identification F-statistics still above 10.
6.3. Inclusion of additional district-level controls
Our baseline regressions include child, mother and household-
level characteristics. However, it may be unrealistic to assume that
all district-level characteristics affecting a couple's use of contracep-
tives are uncorrelated with district-level exposure to family planning
messages over mass-media. Thus, we extend our set of controls to
include several district-level average characteristics. This addresses any
additional concerns regarding whether our IV satisfies the exclusion
restriction. With this analysis, we are also able to check if our baseline
results are robust to the inclusion of district controls. Specifically,
we include information on the number of health sub-centers, primary
health care centers, community health care centers, sub-divisional hos-
pitals, and district hospitals at the district level as additional controls.
We also utilize information on the district average of women's access to
both prenatal and antenatal care provided by ICDS workers/Anganwadi
workers, whether the respondent received any supplementary nutrition
from Anganwadi centers during pregnancy, whether the child received
any benefits from Anganwadi in the last 12 months, whether the child
received food from Anganwadi centers in the last 12 months, how
often did the woman visit Anganwadi/ICDS workers in the last 12
months, the services and matters regarding pre-school, nutrition and
child healthcare discussed with the workers.
below presents the results for the set of regressions where
Table 7
HAZ and WAZ are the outcomes and
where the probability

of being stunted and underweight are the outcomes, respectively. We
begin with discussing the results in
Table 7.
Column (1) shows the
results with the inclusion of these district-level controls on HAZ and
column (2) on WAZ, respectively. We find that the results are robust
to our main estimates upon inclusion of these controls. We note that
contraception leads to a 1.53 SD increase in HAZ and a 0.85 SD
increase in WAZ, respectively. These effects are larger than the baseline
we note that upon inclusion of the district
estimates. From

the probability of being stunted by 20.3 pp and a 21.8 pp decrease

remain statistically significant and largely robust to the baseline results,
we again note greater impacts on the measures of chronic and acute
nutritional deficiencies once we include district-level controls.
6.4. Exclusion of vaccination records
Our baseline analysis includes children's immunization records (re-
ceived polio, BCG, DPT and measles vaccination) as covariates. How-
ever, there may be a concern that vaccination as a control variable
is endogenous in itself. Here, we re-conduct our baseline regressions,
excluding the vaccination information from the set of controls to ex-
plore the extent to which our results are sensitive to the children's
vaccination records.

immunization records relative to their WAZ scores.

being underweight. We note that the use of contraceptives consistently
results in a decline in the probability of stunting. From column (3),
the likelihood of stunting reduces by 17.9 pp, which is the same as
our baseline estimate, suggesting that the measure of stunting is not
sensitive to the exclusion of immunization information. In columns (4)—
(6), while we note a consistently negative effect of contraception on
the probability of being underweight, the effect is precisely estimated
for specifications with no controls and with the set of demographic
controls. Being underweight reduces by 14.1 pp from column (5).

Notes: Outcome variable in Columns (1)—(3) is a binary variable taking the value O if a child is not stunted and 1 if moderately/acutely

of our analysis by also utilizing data from the NFHS - 4 survey wave
and testing whether family planning practices have remained important
for child health. We run our baseline regressions for HAZ and WAZ as
well as for the outcomes denoting chronic nutritional status of children
i.e. stunting and underweight for the years 2015—16.
Table 11
presents the baseline results for HAZ and WAZ using NFHS
4. We present the results in the same progression as our baseline.
We find that in 2015—16 as well, there are important and positive
effects of contraceptive use on child health. In particular, the results are
robust for HAZ for all specifications. From our preferred specification
in column (3), we note that HAZ increases by 0.29 SD if the couple
uses contraceptives. The effect is statistically significant. We find a
similar trend for WAZ as well. From column (5), once we add the same
set of comprehensive controls in our regressions, we find that the use
of contraception leads to a statistically significant rise of 0.26 SD in
the child's WAZ. The effect loses significance once state-fixed effects
are included. Overall, contraceptive use persistently emerges as a key
predictor of children's nutritional outcomes, as evidenced by the results
for the years 2019—21 (our baseline) but also for 2015—16.
Table 12 reports the estimates for the probability of stunting and
being underweight. From columns (1) to (3), it is evident that the use of
contraceptives by the parents leads to a statistically significant decline
in the likelihood of the child being stunted. More specifically, the
probability of stunting declines by 14.4 pp, as seen from the marginal
effect reported in column (3). Results are similar for the probability of
being underweight. The marginal effects suggest a negative effect of
contraceptive use on the likelihood of being underweight. Looking at
column (5) with the comprehensive controls, the reduction is of the
order of 4.3 pp in the probability of being underweight as a result of
limiting fertility through contraceptives. While we find that in both
and 12, the effect loses statistical significance in Column (6)
Tables 11
once state fixed effects are included, we believe this is driven by some
degree of measurement error or imprecision in the data.
By estimating the impact using an earlier round of data, we pro-
vide evidence that nutritional deficiency is a chronic problem for
the country that has yet to show much improvement. This may be
a severe challenge for India in view of the COVID-19 crisis, which
has deteriorated an already critical situation India faces in terms of
malnourishment.
7. Heterogeneity analysis
7.1. Heterogeneous effects of ever using any contraception method
To examine whether our main results vary across different subsam-
ples, we dissect our analytical sample in different ways and estimate
the effect of contraception use on HAZ and WAZ for the sub-samples.
We examine 4 different sub-samples based on - (i) sex of the child, (ii)
caste, (iii) by area of residence, and (iv) wealth. We present the results

WAZ. The following findings are noticeable from this heterogeneity
16
analysis.
By sex of the child: From both panels, the estimates in columns (1)
and (2) show the effect of contraception use on the child's anthropo-
metric measures. We find a much larger statistically significant impact
on a girl's HAZ score compared to boys. A couple's use of contraception
increases a girl's HAZ score by 2.2 SD, whereas a boy's HAZ score
increases by 0.8 SD. Also, we find a statistically significant effect for
girls but not boys when we consider their WAZ scores. Specifically, we
note that the use of contraceptives increases a female child's WAZ by
0.7 SD.
By caste: We find a statistically significant effect of contraceptive
use on children's anthropometric measures for the backward caste.
Contraceptive use increases the child's HAZ and WAZ by 1.6 SD and
0.5 SD, respectively. No such effect is noted for the upper caste. That
said, a word of caution warranted here is that the sample size reduces
by a large extent for the upper caste sample.
By area of residence: Looking at the heterogeneous effects of con-
traceptive use on children's health by rural or urban areas, we find
statistically significant effects for rural areas for both HAZ and WAZ. A
child's HAZ increases by 1.6 SD and WAZ by 0.61 SD in rural areas. We
16 We provide additional heterogeneity analysis based on the mother's age,
mother's education and child's birth order following a LASSO algorithm to
determine important covariates. These results are presented in the Appendix.
do not find a statistically significant effect of limiting fertility through
the use of contraceptives on the nutritional outcomes of children in
urban areas.
By wealth: We divide our sample into poor and rich households
and find statistically significant positive effects of contraceptive use on
children's HAZ for both poor as well as rich households. Whereas, when
considering WAZ as our outcome, we only find an effect for the sub-
sample of poor households. Looking at the estimates for HAZ in column
(8), the effect is larger for the poor households and is of the order of
2 SD for HAZ for the poor households and 0.95 SD for the wealthy
households. The effect of limiting fertility through contraceptives in
poor households shows a 0.59 SD rise in WAZ of children.
7.2. Heterogeneous effects of using modern contraceptive methods
We extend the heterogeneity analysis and examine the effect of
explicitly using only modern contraceptive methods on the HAZ and
WAZ for the same sub-samples. The pattern of results is similar and
robust for the sub-samples of poor households, rural households, and
households belonging to the backward caste as in
Table 13. Table 14
presents the results. The impacts of using modern contraceptives are
stronger and statistically significant in columns (2), (4), (6), and (8),
which speak to the importance of access and awareness of contracep-
tion for these sub-samples. A large proportion of our sample belongs
to rural India, and almost 50% of the households are either classified
as belonging to the poor or the poorest category of the wealth index.

Considering this, it is likely that the poor, the backward castes and rural
households are more supply-constrained in terms of access and ease of
using modern methods of contraceptives, which is possibly driving the
more important effects we find in the heterogeneity analysis.
8. Potential mechanism — quantity—quality trade-off
Here, we attempt to study a potential mechanism explaining the
positive effects of contraceptive use on child health that aligns with
the Becker and Lewis (1973), Becker and Tomes (1976) model of the
quantity—quality trade-off of children. Extant literature documents that
increased parental time with children has significant implications on
early childhood development as well as future human capital accumu-
lation (
Gahramanov et al., 2020; Milkie et al., 2015). Parent's choice
to use contraceptive measures to limit the number of children born
may, therefore, have important implications on resource allocation per
child, the quality of children's outcomes and thus, their nutritional
status. Relatedly, there is substantial evidence recording negative as-
sociations between the use of contraception and family size (Cleland,
2013; Galårraga and Harris, 2021; Dills and Grecu, 2017; Alam and
Pörtner, 2018; Abiona, 2017; Kearney and Levine, 2009; Ananat and
Hungerman, 2012). To explore whether the effect of contraception
use on child health is dependent on the family size, we conduct the

Notes: Outcome variable in Column (1) is a child's height-for-age z-score whereas in Column (2) it is the
child's weight-for-age z-score. The main explanatory variable is a binary indicator taking the value 1 if the
couple has ever used any kind of contraceptive method and O otherwise. The sample is restricted to woman
married only once. All specifications correspond to a linear two-staged least squares estimation where we
have interacted our main variable of interest, contraception use, with household size. We have sequentially
added individual mother's and average child's characteristics, district controls, household controls and finally
state fixed effects. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the cluster level. ***

following analysis where we interact our main variable of interest
Everused with household size. Specifically, we estimate the following
econometric specification:
Yi = [30 + DIEverusedi + 132 H Hsizei + [33 Everusedi * H Hsizei
(2)
where Yi refers to the outcome of interest (HAZ or WAZ) of child i;
Mi and are the vectors of child, mother and household-specific con-
trols; As denotes state fixed effects. Our parameter of interest here, [33
captures the effect of the couple's use of contraception on their child's
health outcomes as household size changes.
Table 15
presents the re-
sults for our outcomes HAZ and WAZ scores. We find that as household
size increases, the impact of contraception use on a child's HAZ and
WAZ scores decreases by 1.7 SD and 0.53 SD, respectively. These
effects are statistically significant. Thus, we note evidence of a negative
differential effect of the interaction between contraception use and
family size. In other words, as household size increases, the beneficial
impacts of improved family planning on child health get smaller.
In order to assess if a change in household size is truly the mecha-
nism explaining the positive effects of contraception on child health,
we further examine the channel running from quantity to quality
in our sample. We first estimate the effect of contraception use on
household size, as illustrated in Panel (a) of Table 16, where we find
that a couple's use of contraception leads to a statistically significant
decline in household size. Following this, we generate the predicted
household size, in line with the methodology followed by Bose et al.
), which we then use to explain a change in a child's HAZ/WAZ
(2020
scores. The results for this are reported in Panel (b) of
Table 16.
Acknowledging that household size is likely endogenous, we examine
its effect on child nutrition using our IV approach. Based on Li et al.
(2008), Rosenzweig and Zhang (2009), Kugler and Kumar (2017), Lee
(2008), Zhang (2017), we consider the birth of twins/multiple births
as the instrument for an exogenous increase in the number of children
in the household. That being said, it is entirely possible that twin or
multiple births may also not be exogenous in that healthier women are
more likely to give births to twins or have multiple births as evidenced
Bhaiotra and Clarke (2019, 2020
). As such, we restrict the sample to
children whose mothers never miscarried nor had stillbirths to address
the potential endogeneity of twins or multiple births as the IV. Utilizing

Notes: Panel (a) illustrates the effect of contraception use on household size. Outcome
variable in columns (1)—(2) in Panel (b) is a child's height-for-age and weight-for-age z-
scores, respectively. The main explanatory variable is the predicted size of a household
based on our estimates in Panel (a). We instrument household size using twin/multiple
births and restrict the sample to women who have never miscarried. The sample is
restricted to women married only once. All specifications correspond to a linear two-
staged least squares estimation. We have included mother's and child's characteristics,
household controls and finally state fixed effects. Standard errors (in parentheses) are
clustered at the cluster level.
and * represent significance at 1%, 5% and 10%,
respectively.
twin/multiple births as the IV for household size, we estimate the effect
of household size on HAZ and WAZ of children.
From columns (1) and (2) in Panel (b), we find that a unit increase
in the predicted household size leads to a decrease in both HAZ and
WAZ by 0.39 SD and 0.34 SD, respectively.17 In line with

and Wiswall (2016)'s findings that family size indeed affects child
health, our estimates in
Table 16
provide support to substantiate the
quantity—quality trade-off and resource dilution hypothesis as a plau-
Sible mechanism driving our main results.18 Thus, we show that an
exogenous increase in the number of children is detrimental to their
nutritional status, making the case for family planning stronger in af-
fecting children's health and providing support to the resource dilution

hypothesis for the case of India.
9. Conclusion
Child malnutrition is currently one of the most critical public health
issues in India, with an alarmingly high proportion of children wasted,
stunted and/or underweight. Media reports and researchers suggest
that India is slipping into a vicious cycle of malnourishment. Despite
several efforts by the government under the umbrella of the National
Food Security Act, which aims to target and significantly reduce child
malnutrition through Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
and Mid Day Meal Scheme (MDMS), India continues to grapple with
poor child health. In light of this, we assert that it is important to
understand other causes and channels that affect child health. In this
paper, we examine one such determinant of children's nutritional sta-
tus. Specifically, utilizing the latest round of the NFHS, we study the
causal effects of parents' family planning practices, that is, their use
of contraception, on children's anthropometric measures of nutritional
surveillance.
By exploring the exogenous variation in the district average expo-
sure of women to family planning messages through mass-media, we
find a positive impact of a couple's choice to use contraception on
children's nutritional statuses. Having controlled for a comprehensive
set of controls as well as state fixed effects, we provide robust evidence
that contraceptive use leads to a 1.45 SD increase in a child's HAZ and
a 0.47 SD increase in her WAZ. In order to provide more context to our
results, we compare and benchmark our estimates against other recent
work examining various factors impacting child health indicators. We
find that our effects are in line with some of these findings. For
example,
) shows that compulsory primary education
Gün# (2015a
of mothers in Turkey results in an increase of HAZ (WAZ) by 1.1
(1) SD respectively and
Chen (2021
) finds that having more than 2
children in violation of Vietnam's two-child policy, reduces HAZ (WAZ)
in 5-year-old children by 0.49 (0.57) SD respectively.
Further, we document interesting heterogeneous effects in that we
find larger effects on a female child's HAZ and WAZ for poor families
and those residing in rural areas for both HAZ and WAZ. Beyond this,
we also note some noteworthy effects of contraceptive use on the mea-
sures of children's stunting and underweight indicators. Specifically,
the probability of being moderately or acutely stunted (underweight)
reduces by 17.9 pp (10.9 pp) as a result of the parent's reproductive
practices. Our results hold across individual child-level data as well
as for the analysis conducted at the household level. The results are
also robust to the inclusion of additional district-level characteristics.
Moreover, we document that a couple's reproductive practices have a
causal effect on child nutrition using data from the previous survey
18 For a given family size, lengthening birth intervals may be another poten-
tial channel for positive effects on child health. Exploring this channel further,
while there is evidence that a couple's use of contraception is positively related
with length of preceding birth intervals, we do not find any evidence of birth
spacing affecting children's anthropometric measures. As such, we are inclined
to rule out this channel as a potential mechanism in our case.
19 As robustness, we also utilize the district average of women's exposure
to family planning messages through mass-media as an IV for household size
given that contraception use limits household size is widely established in the
literature and as such highly correlated with each other. The negative effect of
an increase in household size on a child's HAZ and WAZ score remains robust
to this change in IV. The results are provided in Appendix 1.3 of the paper.

wave of NFHS. This result ought to be important for development
practitioners and policymakers, given that the use of contraceptives by
the parents consistently appears vital in determining children's health
outcomes.
We also examine a potential channel through which we could be
capturing the effect of contraceptive use on a child's nutritional indica-
tors. We provide evidence in support of the quantity—quality trade-off
indicating that with family planning measures and consequently fewer
children, parents are more effectively able to invest resources towards
existing children. We note that a truly exogenous increase in household
size does in fact, lead to a decline in the nutritional indicators of
children for our sample.
Nevertheless, our findings must be read with a few caveats. First,
while our paper finds robust evidence that contraception leads to a
positive effect on child health, our main variable of interest is an indi-
cator of whether the couple has ever used contraception. Information
on when the couple has used contraception or which pregnancy the
use of contraceptives has tried to affect/delay may have led to a richer
analysis. However, it is impossible to identify this record from the
NFHS data. To address this to some extent, we provide an aggregate
household-level analysis. Second, lengthening of birth intervals for a
given family size could be another potential channel of our effects.
Longer birth intervals are known to improve child health outcomes
as evidenced in the literature (
Molitoris, 2017; Miller et al., 1992;
Conde-Agudelo et al., 2006; Yeakey et al., 2009). We find evidence
that contraception is highly correlated with a couple's choice of spacing
births and, as such, attempt to explore this channel in the paper. Using
the information available in NFHS data, we see a positive effect of using
contraception on the length of preceding birth intervals, but the effect
of birth spacing on the anthropometric measures of child health is not
statistically significant, perhaps on account of noisy data for preceding
and succeeding birth spacing. As such, we do not find enough evidence
to establish this as a plausible channel. Third, given the structure of the
NFHS data, the respondent for the child-level and individual questions
is the mother (woman) of the household. We believe that children's nu-
tritional status would also be impacted by their father's characteristics.
However, only a smaller sample of men were interviewed for a short
couple's survey in the data, and including those variables results in the
loss of a large amount of critical information at the woman and child
level. Hence, in our analysis, following the extant literature, we utilize
mother, child and household characteristics, although incorporating the
father's characteristics would make the analysis more refined.
Considering that better nutritional outcomes for children eventually
leads to better human capital accumulation, improved productivity
and reduced healthcare costs, we underline the importance of family
planning measures in tackling child ill-health. We assert that this has
important implications from a policy viewpoint. While better sanita-
tion, food security, and maternal healthcare have been examined as
important determinants of child health in the literature, our paper calls
for greater focus on family planning measures, specifically through
the encouragement of contraceptive use for improved child nutritional
status in a country riddled with both high populations as well as the
triple burden of child malnutrition. Our findings also indicate that, if
anything, these family planning measures have greater positive effects
on children from backward castes, poorer households and those resid-
ing in rural areas. Therefore, it may be important to channel greater
efforts towards these groups to reap sizeable benefits for children's
health outcomes.

The prevailing COVID-19 pandemic
and climate change-mediated
wildfires can combine to impact
maternal—child health, yet this con-
nection remains understudied. To
shape policies and design inter-
ventions to mitigate the combined
effects of future global catastro-
phes, it is vital to holistically evalu-
ate the impact of syndemics on
maternal—child health.
Back-to-back crises threaten fetal
health
The unfolding of the ongoing coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has
been accompanied by devastating wild-
fires in certain regions of the world, thus
producing a syndemic (see
Glossary)
for which the impact remains elusive [1].
Notably, eastern Australia (bushfires,
followed by COVID-19) and western
USA (COVID-19, followed by wildfires)
are two such regions where the back-
to-back crises left little time in between
for the affected communities, health
care, public health, and social services
to recover. This is particularly concerning
when we consider the compounding
effects of wildfires and COVID-19 on
health, as demonstrated by a study of US
adults reporting an 8% increase in
COVID-19 deaths for each 1 vg/m3 in-
crease in air PM2.5 levels [2]. Although the
combination of two adverse developmental
exposures or second hits has been widely
investigated previously (e.g. combination
of poor diet and physical inactivity), how
the effects of natural disasters and global
health crises combine to impact maternal—
child health remains unclear.
Pregnancy is a critical window in human
development, as the fetus is particularly
vulnerable to external exposures, result-
ing in lifelong adverse consequences for
the offspring's health. In this context,
wildfires (extreme heat and smoke expo-
sure) have been identified as an environ-
mental exposure that is associated with
detrimental pregnancy and child health
outcomes. Prenatal exposure to wildfires
has been linked to abnormal birth weight
and heightened rates of prematurity,
gestational diabetes, and hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy [3]. Similarly, the
COVID-19 pandemic has been shown
to increase maternal mortality, ruptured
ectopic pregnancies, stillbirth, and ma-
ternal depression [4]. Furthermore, we
increasingly recognize that COVID-19 is
disproportionately impacting women
and babies worldwide, not only due to
infections with severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
[5], but also from disruptions to maternal
and child health services [6]. It may
therefore be expected that women who
were pregnant during wildfires and gave
birth during the pandemic would experi-
ence more adverse pregnancy out-
comes with detrimental consequences
on their own long-term health and that
of their offspring. Given the prevailing
COVID-19 pandemic and our changing
climate amplifying the frequency and
severity of wildfires, there is an urgent
need for research that recognizes the
complexity of these synergistic crises,
considers their temporal occurrence
and the type of combined effects
they may have (additive, subtractive,

maternal—child health.

Potential mechanisms underlying
synergism in effects of wildfires
and COVID-19 on maternal and
child metabolic health
In this section, we elaborate on the knowl-
edge gaps on mechanisms by which wild-
fires and the COVID-19 pandemic may
have synergistic detrimental effects on
maternal—child metabolic health. We pro-
pose that the synergism is a consequence
of overlapping and interconnected mech-
anisms mediated by indirect effects on life-
style, individual and family psychological
stress, and social cohesion that are com-
mon to the two crises (Figure 1). These in-
direct effects then amplify the overall
response by compounding the previously
reported direct toxic effects of wildfire
smoke, extreme heat, and maternal
SARS-CoV-2 infection on the pregnant
mother
including immune system
changes, oxidative stress, and abnormal
placental morphology and function [5,7
The placenta may have an important role
in protecting the fetus in such circum-
stances, which may explain the low rates
of vertical SARS-CoV-2 transmission [5].
However, its capacity to protect may be
reduced with cumulative insults, as is
more likely in syndemics.
Wildfires and COVID-19 are known to in-
fluence lifestyle (diet, physical activity,
sleeping patterns), behavior (substance
abuse), and mood, all of which have
consequences for health and metabolism
during pregnancy. Changes in lifestyle
could be driven by extrinsic factors, such

Box 1. Timing is key
• The temporal order of crises and triggered mechanisms is critical.
Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism
• In syndemic research, it is essential to consider he order in which crises A/B and resulting mechanisms
occurred, as crisis A could exacerbate or reduce he impact of crisis B on maternal—child health outcomes.
For example, natural disas ers increase psychological distress [10], which could dampen maternal
immune response during COVID-19 [5]. A1 ernatively, COVID-19 increased communi y solidarity and
resilience [6], which could facilitate community engagement and decrease individual distress during a
wildfire evacuation.
• During pregnancy and development, the concept of 'critical window' is well es ablished. When a particular
disaster/crisis perturbs these cri cal windows, it determines the impact of that event on maternal and child
health. For example, crisis occurrence in pregnancy could affect fetal organ development, while postnatally
it could affec breastfeed ng [11].
• Hence, the temporal order should be given pivotal consideration to appropriately assess the
consequences of syndemcs on maternal—child health.
as restriction to indoors to avoid wildfire
smoke or to adhere to COVID-19 lock-
downs, leading to loss of capacity to exer-
cise and/or reduced access to healthy
food. Intrinsic factors such as crises-
induced stress may reduce one's capacity
to cope, and promote unhealthy behaviors
such as substance abuse (e.g., smoking,
alcohol, illicit drugs use, and/or misuse of
prescribed medicines).

to health care and childcare services, and
restrictions in the number of family and
friends allowed to support mothers during
childbirth and postpartum (critical times for
maternal—child bonding) are commonly re-
ported, further exacerbating stress during
pregnancy.
Furthermore, we know that outside a crisis
context, partners play a crucial role in
supporting mothers throughout preg-
nancy and parenting, and independently
(separate from mothers) influence their
children's growth and development [8]. ln-
deed, during interviews and open-ended
survey questions of the Mother and Child
2020 study, women reported that their
partners were an indispensable source of
support. Despite this recognized partners'
contribution, there is a paucity of research
on the role of partners' mental health, and
mother and partner 'dyadic coping', in
family well-being and parenting function-
ing following syndemics. Most research
considers only one family member or
parent, primarily mothers, failing to investi-
gate how the psychological health of both
parents (in two-partner families) interact.
During crises, partner's support (social,
emotional, and practical) is expected to
be pivotal in mitigating the onset of poor
maternal psychological well-being.
Maternal psychological well-being plays
a crucial role in maintaining a healthy
intrauterine milieu and protecting the
offspring from metabolic diseases later in
life. In addition to stress-modifying mater-
nal behavior (substance abuse) and life-
style (diet, physical activity, and sleeping
pattern), four key biological mechanisms
(implemented at the gene or protein level)
underlying abnormal offspring metabolic
health due to maternal psychological
stress are perturbed (i) maternal and
fetal
hypothalamic—pituitary—adrenal
(HPA) axis mediated by maternal to
fetal transport of stress hormones via the
placenta, (ii) maternal—fetal placental
malperfusion (fetal deprivation of oxygen


Trends in Endocrinology & Metabolism
and nutrient supply), (iii) programming of
immunity [shift in the T helper (T h) 2 cell
anti-inflammatory and Thl proinflamma-
tory balance], and (iv) epigenetic program-
ming (imprinting defects, altered DNA/
histone methylation/acetylation) [9]. lm-
portantly, mother/child can be genetically
predisposed to environmental perturba-
tions [e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) increases COVID-19 infection
risk; G-protein-coupled receptor (GPRA) in-
creases asthma risk during wildfires], which
catalyzes the development of chronic dis-
ease in some exposed individuals. These
effects are likely to be further compounded
by typical pregnancy stressors and exacer-
bate maternal psychological vulnerability,
with potentially detrimental metabolic con-
sequences for both the mother and the
child as evident in other natural disasters
such as floods and ice storms [10]. How-
ever, the synergistic impact of wildfires
and COVID-19 on the offspring's metabolic
health related to maternal psychological
stress, its time course, and ensuing dyadic
effects on mother and child are yet to be
determined.
Need for a multidisciplinary
approach to close gaps in evidence
As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progresses
and wildfires increase in frequency, it is vital
to investigate the complex and intercon-
nected mechanisms at play that adversely
impact on the metabolic health of mother
and child during syndemics. Mechanisms
that are common to both types of expo-
sures and/or have synergistic harmful ef-
fects on maternal—child metabolic health
are essential to determine (e.g., HPA axis,
placental malperfusion, immune program-
ming, epigenetics, genetics), as focusing
interventions on these mechanisms with
evidence-based approaches are most
likely to be effective at mitigating risks. Un-
derstanding the direct biological effects
(e.g., oxidative stress) of wildfire smoke, ex-
cessive heat, and COVID-19 infection on
health is clearly important. However, the in-
direct effects of syndemics on maternal—
child health through perturbing lifestyle
(diet, physical activity, sleeping patterns),
behavior (substance abuse), mental health,
social cohesion, and the contribution of
partners/family dynamics are equally critical
in driving metabolic disease pathogenesis,
and therefore need to be comprehensively
investigated using a multidisciplinary re-
search approach [1 1]
Concluding remarks
A healthy start to life from the prenatal to the
neonatal period is critical for achieving opti-
mal long-term metabolic health for mothers
and babies. To provide every child with a
healthy start to life, it is essential that our
research, response, and recovery efforts
during times of crises are directed toward
supporting women, children, and young
families. Recent World Health Organization
(WHO)—United Nations International Chil-
dren's Emergency Fund (UNICEF)—Lancet
Commission [1 2] and WHO [13] reports
highlight that to prevent current and future
generations from the devastating conse-
quences of climate change and the ongoing
COVID-19 pandemic, we must prioritize and
invest in the health of our children. This will
profoundly benefit health and economies
globally and must be placed at the center
of our Sustainable Development Goals [12].
Recent global environmental crises and the
pandemic are an impetus to assess the syn-
ergistic impact of these environmental and
health crises on the growth, develop-
ment, and long-term metabolic health of
our youngest generation. To learn les-
sons from the current crises and be
better prepared for future ones, it is es-
sential to establish multidisciplinary col-
laborative studies aimed at collecting
and analyzing detailed quantitative [1 4
and qualitative [15] information on how
pregnant women and young families
are affected at an individual and popula-
tion level [1 1] by wildfires and COVID-19
concurrently. Importantly, a greater
focus is needed on how reduced social
connectivity and disrupted family dynam-
ics, access to health care services, and
CelPress
health-promoting behaviors have impacted
the psychological well-being of pregnant
women with long-lasting metabolic health
consequences for mothers and children.

Advanced maternal age and risk perception: A
qualitative study

Abstract
Background: Advanced maternal age (AMA) is associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes, hence these
pregnancies are considered to be "high risk." A review of the empirical literature suggests that it is not clear how
women of AMA evaluate their pregnancy risk. This study aimed to address this gap by exploring the risk perception
of pregnant women of AMA.
Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to obtain a rich and detailed source of explanatory data
regarding perceived pregnancy risk of 15 women of AMA. The sample was recruited from a variety of settings in
Winnipeg, Canada. In-depth interviews were conducted with nulliparous women aged 35 years or older, in their
third trimester, and with singleton pregnancies. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and content
analysis was used to identify themes and categories.
Results: Four main themes emerged: definition of pregnancy risk, factors influencing risk perception, risk alleviation
strategies, and risk communication with health professionals.
Conclusions: Several factors may influence women's perception of pregnancy risk including medical risk,
psychological elements, characteristics of the risk, stage of pregnancy, and health care provider's opinion.
Understanding these influential factors may help health professionals who care for pregnant women of AMA to
gain insight into their perspectives on pregnancy risk and improve the effectiveness of risk communication
strategies with this group.
Keywords: Advanced maternal age, Risk perception, Qualitative study
Background
In the past three decades, an increasing proportion of
women have delayed childbearing for educational, social,
and economic reasons [1,2]. Pregnancy at advanced ma-
ternal age (AMA), defined as age 35 years or older, is
associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes in-
cluding preterm birth, low birth weight, still birth,
chromosomal defects, labor complications, and cesarean
section [3-7]; therefore, it is considered to be a "high
risk" pregnancy. However, little is known about how
women of AMA perceive their pregnancy risk. Under-
standing perception of pregnancy risk is important, be-
cause it can affect women's health care use, motivations

to seek care, pregnancy and labor decisions, adherence
to medical recommendations, and health behavior [8-
10]. Risk perception is also incorporated as a key con-
cept in constructing several theories of health behavior
such as the Health Belief Model [11], Protection Motiv-
ation Theory [12], and Prospect Theory [13].
The concept of risk at AMA may be composed of two
components: the physiological challenges because of an
aging reproductive system, and the social discourse of
risk and timing of childbearing [14]. Most previous work
on risk perception at AMA has focused on increased
risk of genetic abnormalities, and the general concept of
pregnancy risk perception has received less consider-
ation. Current knowledge of risk perception at AMA is
based on a few studies that most of them primarily fo-
cused on pregnancy experiences, in which risk percep-
tion was discussed as part of the pregnancy and birth
experience. For instance, Windridge and Berryman

(1999), in a study of 107 British women's experiences of
giving birth at AMA, explored risk perception and
reported that women of AMA may perceive a higher risk
for their babies during labor because of their older age
[15]. Another notable study on this topic is an Austra-
lian qualitative study of 22 prim gravid women of AMA
that was initially conducted to understand the experi-
ences of women of AMA [16]. Later, in 2007, Carolan
and Nelson conducted a secondary analysis of the quali-
tative data and identified four themes central to percep-
tion of pregnancy risk including "realizing I was at risk,"
"hoping for reassurance," "dealing with uncertainty," and
"getting through it/negotiating risk" [14], p.540. They
reported high levels of concern and anxiety among parti-
cipants, in spite of these women having healthy pregnan-
cies, and concluded that the notion of risk may have
negative impacts on these women. A qualitative study by
Saxell (2003) primarily focused on studying the under-
standings and beliefs about the risks associated with the
pregnancies of ten women of AMA. Saxell reported that
these women found being labeled as high risk very chal-
lenging; hence, several participants rejected this labeling
as part of their coping mechanism. This study had a
number of limitations such as retrospective data collec-
tion (36 months after delivery) and its unique population
(participants who chose midwifery care), which should
be considered in the interpretation of the results.
The focus of previous studies has been on describing
the impact of being labeled as high risk on pregnant
women, rather than exploring and elaborating on the
process of risk appraisal by these women. Understanding
women's perception of pregnancy risk is essential in devel-
oping more effective risk communication approaches.
Considering the lack of literature in this area and limita-
tions associated with previous studies, we conducted a
mixed methods research study to further existing know-
ledge on risk perception and its contributing factors.
Mixed methods research is "research in which the inves-
tigator collects and analyzes data, integrates the findings,
and draws inferences using both qualitative and quantita-
tive approaches or methods in a single study or a pro-
gram of inquiry" [17], p.4. Mixed methods research gives
the researcher an ability to use both numbers and words
and combine inductive and deductive thinking to address
the research problem [18]. Our study was composed of
both qualitative and quantitative components and using
a mixed methods approach, we compared or integrated
the factors contributing to perception of pregnancy risk
(determined by multiple regression analyses) with the
women's perspectives (obtained from 15 qualitative inter-
views) to enhance current knowledge on this topic. The
sample for the mixed methods study consisted of 159
participants (105 women aged 20-29 years and 54
women aged 35 years or older). In the quantitative
Page 2 of 13
component, we compared perception of pregnancy risk
in nulliparous women aged 35 years or older (n = 54)
with that of nulliparous women aged 20-29 years
(n = 105) [19]. In the quantitative component, we also
developed a conceptual framework to explore factors
contributing to risk perception among nulliparous
women (N = 159) [20]. The study reported here is the
qualitative component of this mixed methods study. The
objectives of this qualitative study were to explore how
nulliparous women of AMA evaluate and define their
pregnancy risk and to arrive at a detailed understanding
of their risk perception. The following research questions
were explored: 1. How do nulliparous women of AMA
define pregnancy risk? 2. Why do women of AMA feel
that their pregnancy is, or is not, at risk? Which factors
influence perception of pregnancy risk? 3. What impact,
if any, did being labeled high risk have on these women's
lives and behaviors? 4. What are the experiences of
women of AMA with risk communication from health
care providers during pregnancy? How do women feel
their perceptions of risk differ from those of their health
care providers, if at all?
Methods
A qualitative descriptive study was undertaken to obtain
a rich and detailed source of explanatory data regarding
risk perception from women of AMA. As described by
Sandelowski (2000), a qualitative descriptive study pro-
vides "a comprehensive summary of an event in the
everyday terms of those events" [21], p.336. The qualita-
tive descriptive method is a distinctive and valuable
technique and offers a direct description of phenomena,
which is still interpretive [22]. As Sandelowski (2000)
stated, this kind of research can address both descriptive
and interpretive validity to account for participants'
observations and their understandings of these events.
Participants were chosen purposefully from among the
participants in the quantitative component of the mixed
methods study. Criteria for participation in the larger
mixed methods study were women with a singleton
pregnancy, ability to speak, read, and write English, and
gestational age of 28 weeks or greater. Any known se-
vere psychological disorder was an exclusion criterion.
Data were collected over 14 months, from (December
2009 to January 2011) from selected physicians' offices
and outpatient prenatal care clinics at two tertiary hospi-
tals in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
In purposeful sampling, participants are intentionally
selected according to the needs of the study [23]. The
researcher asked selected women aged 35 years or older
who had participated in the quantitative component of
the study if they were willing to participate in the quali-
tative component. Participants were selected to ensure
diversity in demographic and obstetric characteristics,


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
most notably gestational age and pregnancy complica-
tions. In addition, participants were recruited to reflect a
range of scores using the Perception of Pregnancy Risk
Questionnaire [24] used in the quantitative component,
to ensure inclusion of participants with different levels
of perception of pregnancy risk.
Potential participants were provided with a written
and verbal explanation of the study. Each participant
signed a consent form. A mutually convenient time and
place were arranged to conduct the interviews. In-depth,
semi-structured, face to face interviews, using an inter-
view guide, were conducted by the researcher from Janu-
ary 2010 to January 2011. The interview guide was
developed by the investigators and key areas explored
included decision making about timing of childbearing,
women's understandings about pregnancy after age 35,
perceived pregnancy risk and its impact on woman's
feelings and thoughts, partner's perspectives about preg-
nancy, and women's experiences with the health care
system. All interviews were audio-recorded and tran-
scribed verbatim. In qualitative inquiry, sample size re-
lies on the concept of "saturation" which is the point at
which no new information or themes are observed in
the data [25]. Saturation was reached after interviewing
15 participants.
Data analysis was carried out concurrently with data
collection. Transcripts were analyzed using a content
analysis technique [26]. Content analysis is a systematic
and replicable method used for condensing many words
of text into fewer content categories based on explicit
rules of coding [27]. As mentioned earlier, this study was
part of a mixed methods research study in which several
instruments were administered to women participating
in the quantitative component. In this report, selected
quantitative measures including the Perception of Preg-
nancy Risk Questionnaire (PPRQ) [24], perceived in-
ternal control [28], and pregnancy-related anxiety [29]
scores have been reported to enrich information about
participants and enhance the interpretations of the find-
ings. The scores on these scales were divided into tertiles
representing low, middle, and high scores, based on the
responses of the women aged 35 years or older in the
larger mixed methods study (n = 54) (Table 1). Table 2
illustrates the number of participants in each tertile from
the qualitative component.

According to Davies and Dodd (2002), rigor refers to
the reliability and validity of qualitative research; how-
ever, it does not necessitate the sense of replicability of
the research in different situations that is common in
quantitative research [30]. In the current study, a valid-
ation process was performed during and after conduct-
ing the interviews using two strategies. In the first
method, member checking was used in which during
each interview, the researcher (HB) verified the accuracy
of her interpretations with participants by asking further
questions. After completion of data analysis, interpreta-
tions of data were shared by twelve participants who had
previously agreed to review and verify findings of the
study. Second, the results were confirmed with peer re-
view and debriefing through regular meetings with one
of the co-investigators (MH) to achieve a jointly devel-
oped interpretation of the data. Dependability was
obtained through use of an audit trail. In this strategy,
contextual information and participant's reflections were
documented. The ways to address confirmability in this
study were using direct quotes and confirming the find-
ings with participants during interviews.
This project was reviewed and approved by four com-
mittees prior to commencing data collection: the Uni-
versity of Manitoba Education/Nursing Research Ethics
Board, the Health Sciences Centre Research Impact
Committee, the St. Boniface Hospital Research Review
Committee, and the Winnipeg Regional Health Author-
ity Research Review Committee.
Results
The sample consisted of 15 nulliparous women. The age
range of participants was 35 to 44 years with a mean of
37.6 years. The majority of women were highly educated
with a mean educational level of 18.7 years. All partici-
pants were married or living common-law. All except
one had been working during pregnancy. Over half
(53.3%) of the women reported an annual family income
of $100,000 or over. All participants were in the last tri-
mester of their pregnancies, with a mean gestational age
of 35.6 weeks (ranging from 32 to 40 weeks). All partici-
pants except one considered their pregnancy to be
planned. Five participants had one or more previous
miscarriages and three participants reported use of fertil-
ity medications to become pregnant. Participants delayed

their childbearing for a variety of reasons. The primary
reason for some women was lifestyle choices (n = 6).
This group of women described being focused on their
career, education, or travel, or indicated that they did
not feel that they were ready to have children until they
reached an older age. Delayed marriage was the primary
reason for six other participants. Finally, three women
identified infertility issues as their primary reason for
postponed childbearing. It should be noted that infertil-
ity was also reported among participants in the delayed
marriage and lifestyle choices groups, however it was
not their prime reason for delayed childbearing.
The findings of this study were categorized into the
following themes: definition of pregnancy risk, factors
influencing risk perception, risk alleviation strategies,
and risk communication with health professionals.
Definition of pregnancy risk
The first theme describes participants' understandings
of pregnancy risk and explains how they defined risk.
Most participants acknowledged that pregnancy risk
increases as maternal age rises; however, a number of
women felt that the risk had been overestimated. For
example, one of the participants stated that "those
numbers don't matter," (Participant 1) and another
mentioned that "it's an overreaction, frankly" (Partici-
pant 11). Women's understandings of risks associated
with AMA were reflected most often in comments
about their awareness of increased risk of infertility
issues and genetic abnormalities, particularly Down
syndrome. Fertility problems associated with delayed
childbearing were an immense concern for most
women rather than pregnancy-related issues. In this
regard, most of the women who delayed marriage
reported that they decided to become pregnant soon
after marriage to minimize the effect of age factor on
their fecundity.
It was noted that women considered pregnancy as
more of a societal issue rather than merely a biomedical
matter, in which personal, interpersonal, and societal ele-
ments were significant. For our participants, the mean-
ing of risk was broader than medical issues and included
the extent of their support network, their ability to con-
trol situations, and whether they had a secure relation-
ship, a planned pregnancy, a flexible job or healthy
lifestyle and behavior. These considerations were also
evident in decisions regarding timing of pregnancy by
participants. The following quote is an example of the
broadness of risk definition by one participant with an
uncomplicated pregnancy:
"A high risk pregnancy to me would have been if I
had no control over my work environment .
so
even just the ability to be able to work from home .
if I was working in more a violent situation, if I
was in a bad relationship I think that would make
me more of a high-risk pregnancy, than my personal
age or my personal health." (Participant 13)
In the following quote, a 39 year-old participant stated
on the importance of having a stable relationship and a
healthy lifestyle:
"I think you; you have to factor in your physical
condition
[that] you're in good health and
you're taking care of yourself and you're planning
on getting married and you go and get your
physicals
I see a lot of younger girls that are
pregnant and they're drinking bottles of coke and
they're drinking coffee and they're drinking, you
know they're eating McDonald's and I'm like that
hasn't been my pregnancy, you know I've cut out
sugar and I've never drank coffee so I don't worry
about that. " (Participant 1)
A 36 year-old participant with gestational diabetes and
a moderate perceived risk score commented:
"I had this, this calm, calm feeling inside of me that
everything was going to be okay .
having a husband
that is loving, caring, supportive and you know [is]
my best friend, so that really really helps a lot, and
having friends, you know friends to support to, to
help you, to talk with you if you have any need and
we have so many people caring about us, so um .
having a whole community to, to be there for you if
you need." (Participant 12)
Factors influencing risk perception
The magnitude of the perception of pregnancy risk dif-
fered among our participants. During data analysis, nine
factors were identified that influenced women's perception


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
of pregnancy risk including: cognitive heuristics of avail-
ability and similarity of the risk, predictability of the risk,
health status, pregnancy complications, gestational age,
perceived control, poor fertility history, anxiety, and the
health care provider's opinion.
Cognitive heuristics
Women's understandings of risk were mostly based on
their experiences of real cases, and they relied on these
data in assessment of their own pregnancy risk:
"From my experience in Europe, where most women
are having their children in their thirties and not their
twenties and, to be honest, I didn't, and I lived there
for a long time, I didn't see the amount of Down's
syndrome or other physical abnormalities that you see
here." (Participant 11)
Most participants had an example of pregnancy at
AMA among one of their family members, friends or
colleagues. Availability of a positive example or a favor-
able family history of fertility at AMA was often
reported as a reassuring factor that increased women's
perceived ability to conceive at AMA and to have a suc-
cessful pregnancy. These participants often perceived
their pregnancy as being low risk.
"I know a lot of women that are having their first
child in their forties ..
and everything has worked
out fantastic, so I always looked at them as sort of my
mentors or role models." (Participant 5)
"Both like my mother had me when she was 36, I
think, and my partner's mother had her last one when
she was 41, so it's, it doesn't seem that abnormal in
my [family] ... And I think maybe that ... made me
feel less risky as well cause I had, you know,
generations before me that had late babies and with
no complications." (Participant 8)
On the other hand, women who were familiar with the
risks associated with older maternal age, through per-
sonal or vicarious experiences, expressed more concerns
and perceived a higher risk for their pregnancies. One of
the participants with a fairly healthy pregnancy and a
high perception of pregnancy risk score commented:
"A friend of mine got pregnant; I think she was 36,
and she did have a baby who had so many problems
that they were surprised the baby's heart was even still
beating in her womb, so she ended up terminating
that pregnancy, and she's still broken up about ..
so
I was debating this ... So yeah I did have that one
friend, and of course, the woman who told me about
her near death experience in labor." (Participant 4)
Page 5 of 13
"Availability of risk" is a cognitive heuristic that refers
to "a cognitive shortcut used for judging the probability
of an event by the ease with which examples of the event
come to mind" [29], p.248. Based on participants' expla-
nations, this concept appeared to be very important in
risk appraisal. One participant with a high perception of
pregnancy risk score explained: "if it [risk] happens to
other people, then it could happen to me."
"Similarity" is another cognitive heuristic and reflects
"a cognitive shortcut used for judging the probability of
an event by its similarity to events with comparable fea-
tures" [29], p.248. Women often assessed their preg-
nancy risk by comparing their own characteristics with
those who developed a pregnancy complication. The fol-
lowing comment from a 37 year-old participant is an ex-
ample of using the similarity heuristic in risk appraisal:
"I had that friend who was 36 and had a baby who
had Trisomy 18, and she felt that it was because of
her age .
but she is not as healthy as I am. She
actually may have an alcohol problem, and she's taken
a lot of medications in her life for depression and all
kinds of things, and she doesn't really work out very
much, and she just wasn't as healthy [as I
am]."(Participant 4)
Predictability of the risk
An expected and predictable pregnancy complication
was perceived as a lower risk situation than a non-
predicted and unexpected problem. One participant with
a low perceived risk score, who had severe morning sick-
ness in early pregnancy, described it as a "typical preg-
nancy symptom" that could happen in "every pregnancy."
On the other hand, another participant with a high per-
ception of risk score and a low perceived control score,
who had to stop working for an unexpected, threatened
premature labor stated:
'It's been challenging, so it's not what I expected
1
did not expect to feel an almost arthritic pain the last
two months, I didn't expect that morning sickness
would be 24 hours a day for five months instead of
three, neither of us were expecting this ... I was
expecting to work until my due date and come to the
hospital and you know I was ready to be like every
other mom, well most other moms where you work
till the end and sometimes you just go from work
straight to the hospital in labor." (Participant 6)
A 37 year-old participant with a high perception of
risk score who was diagnosed with gestational diabetes
explained that:
"Both of my parents have adult onset diabetes, and my
mother had gestational diabetes with my brother


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
when she was roughly the same age as me, and so I,
pretty much expected to have gestational diabetes, so
I was careful right from the beginning, making sure
that I was exercising and trying to eat healthfully and
. so I was cautious about that
[however] I
so on .
was surprised to find that I had needed the insulin for
it as opposed [to] control by diet; that was a bit of a
shock. It was a shock to discover that it was that
severe to begin with and that I would need the
insulin." (Participant 9)
Health status
Most women in our study considered themselves
healthy and felt that they had control over their physical
health. Good health was frequently identified as a factor
that would decrease risk when participants assessed
their pregnancy risk in relation to age. They often
emphasized their good health as a balancing capacity in
pregnancy risk estimation. A 35 year-old participant at
30 weeks of gestation with a low perception of risk
score commented:
"Because I was, I'm always, I've always been a quite a
healthy person, it, it never really concerned me that
much that I was older and having a baby." (Participant 8)
Pregnancy complications
Among our participants, three women had gestational
diabetes, one had vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks, and
one had both vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks and
threatened preterm labor. Based on our findings, preg-
nancy complications had some influence on the percep-
tion of pregnancy risk; depending on the type of
complication, its impact on the woman's life, and the de-
gree to which the woman felt that complication had
been controlled. For instance, the woman with threa-
tened preterm labor who had to quit work expressed a
high risk perception. On the other hand, the other three
women, who described their gestational diabetes as a
well-controlled situation, had low to moderate percep-
tion of risk scores. The following statement was made by
one of the participants who had a moderate perceived
risk score:
"I've developed gestational diabetes in the end but
that's probably due to the fact that I already had
polycystic ovary syndrome, so there was already
insulin resistance ... there was nausea initially but no
vomiting, um a lot of weight gain, but again that's the
insulin resistance, so it's been an easy pregnancy, I
suppose." (Participant 11)
Women with pregnancy complications often had
higher pregnancy-related anxiety scores. One of the
Page 6 of 13
participants with gestational diabetes expressed concerns
regarding having a larger baby than average and also
long-term consequences of diabetes:
"The first week [after diagnosis] I was very very sad, I
was very sad because I, I was concerned, you know,
having a big baby and, and he has any complication
[in] the pregnancy, um I was very sad for him that I
may be passing this gene." (Participant 12)
Gestational age
Most participants reported that they felt more relaxed
about risk and developing pregnancy-related problems as
their pregnancy progressed. The participants described
pregnancy as having several milestones, and completing
each phase seemed to increase their confidence in having
a healthy pregnancy:
"As time went on, it got a little bit easier to feel like I
wasn't at as much risk in terms of the pregnancy."
(Participant 7)
"As I get closer [to delivery] and I haven't had any
problems I'm getting more and more confident and I
feel a little bit better." (Participant 1)
Toward the end of pregnancy, the meaning of older
age as a risk factor for most women with uncomplicated
pregnancies remained simply a number. Some women
used phrases such as "it was just that number and that's
Perceived control
The majority of women in our study perceived them-
selves to be prepared to accept child raising responsibil-
ities. Participants' comments reflected that most of them
had a good sense of internal control, both over their life
situations and their health. Considering the pregnancy-
related anxiety and risk perception scores of participants
and their explanations, it was evident that women with
high perceived control had lower perceived risk. The fol-
lowing quote was expressed by a 39 year-old participant
who had a high perceived control score and a low per-
ception of risk score:
"I just [know] the way my body responds to things .
I understand my body, I'm very in tune with how my
body works and I can always tell when something's
not right." (Participant 1)
Conversely, low perceived control was often observed
in conjunction with high perceived risk. Sometimes the
woman's religious beliefs changed the equation. The fol-
lowing statement was made by a 44 year-old participant


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
who had both low perceived control and low perceived
risk scores:
"Both of us felt strongly that .
um you know we
believe strongly in God and that he was in control."
(Participant 7)
Poor fertility history
A number of participants mentioned that they lost a
sense of control over their bodies and their own health
to a great extent after enduring infertility experiences.
For some women a history of infertility or miscarriage
led to increased risk perception in pregnancy. A 37 year-
old woman with a high risk perception score and a his-
tory of infertility commented:
"I planned to get pregnant .
and I wasn't able to,
like the first thing that came to my mind, I'm not a
life giver, it's not because you wanted to get pregnant
at this month you'll get pregnant, I am not in control.
If I'm not given that then I can't do, it's beyond my
powers." (Participant 15)
The emotional impact of previous fertility issues on
the current pregnancy was expressed by words such as
having worry, stress, and fear. For example, a 37 year-
old woman with a previous miscarriage who had a high
perception of pregnancy risk score stated:
"I wasn't at [risk] first, but then after I lost the first baby,
I thought well maybe this is because I'm old ... I was
stressed, I didn't really deal with it." (Participant 4)
A 44 year-old participant believed that infertility treat-
ments had a negative impact on her physical health. This
belief was also tracked in other participants' explanations
with infertility experiences:
"I think what plays into how I perceive my pregnancy
is, is not just my age, it's the journey I took to get
here, it was because it took four years to get here ...
and it was a hard four years. My body wasn't [at risk],
I wasn't, when we first started trying I was extremely
healthy and in shape and, and felt ready, and then as I
went through all the fertility procedures my health, it
affected my health ... and I didn't feel myself, I didn't
feel as strong as I was, so coming into a pregnancy
now where I was coming off of all that fertility stuff, it
made me feel like I might be at a higher risk."
(Participant 7)
Anxiety
Although most participants in this study expressed some
degree of concern for the health and well-being of their
babies, only a few women were very anxious.
Page 7 of 13
Nevertheless, we found that these women often did not
use "anxiety" as a term to describe their anxious feelings.
For instance, the following quote comes from a 39 year-
old participant who had a high anxiety score:
"There still is a little bit in the back of my mind, once
the baby is born .
is the baby going to, is everything
going to be okay with the baby and through delivery
and through labor? So there is a little bit, not anxiety,
I wouldn't say anxiety, but a little bit of concern.'
(Participant 5)
"Being emotional" was another term that a 35 year-old
participant with a high anxiety score and moderate per-
ception of risk score used to express her feelings:
"I'm a little bit emotional, I think that's my biggest,
been my biggest struggle throughout the entire
pregnancy is my emotional state. First with being so
worried and then hormones, I wasn't, I was depressed,
and now I'm having trouble sleeping, which is causing
a lot of frustration, and I'm really uncomfortable."
(Participant 2)
According to participants' explanations, waiting for
screening results, bed rest and limiting physical activities
due to pregnancy complications (e.g., morning sickness)
contributed to their risk perception. One participant
with a high perceived risk score and a high anxiety score
who experienced morning sickness in early pregnancy
explained:
"I didn't feel very good for many months, so I couldn't
eat, I was barfing a lot, so that probably added to my
stress being home all day cause I couldn't work and
not being able to eat, so that always, you know,
increases your stress, and it lowers your resistance
too." (Participant 4)
Feeling that this pregnancy might be their last chance
to have a biological child might increase anxiety for
these women and add to the dilemma. A 40 year-old
participant with a complicated pregnancy who had a
high perception of risk score and a low perceived control
score explained:
"High risk mostly is, or my perception of high risk is
if something happened to myself or my child, this
may be my only chance to be pregnant and deliver a
child." (Participant 6)
Health care providers' opinion
Health care providers' perspectives about risk and their
reaction to, and interpretation of, risk had a considerable


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
influence on the women's understandings and assess-
ments of their own risk. Participants' explanations
revealed that health care providers' opinions, as experts
in risk assessment, were viewed as very valuable and re-
lied upon by women. Although care providers do not
usually disclose their personal opinion, women may in-
tuit it by observing care providers' reactions and body
language. Women may include this information in deter-
mining of their risk levels, especially if there is an uncer-
tainty associated with the level of vulnerability. As a
37 year-old participant with a low perception of risk
score and a low anxiety score remarked:
"My family doctor called me to tell me that the baby
has to have an ultrasound after a month, but the
doctor here doesn't seem, doesn't seem bothered by it,
so I don't think it's got anything to do with the baby
having, like, mental or physical disability of any sorts;
I think it's just more, just something for them to look
at." (Participant 13)
Taking into consideration that several participants in
this study reported that they did not have major discus-
sions with their health care providers about risks asso-
ciated with AMA, it might give these women a degree of
confidence that there are no serious concerns.
Risk alleviation strategies
Several strategies were reported by the participants to
help them alleviate and/or cope with their pregnancy
risk. This process, for our participants, involved edu-
cating themselves and engaging in a healthy lifestyle,
undertaking reassuring surveillance tests, overlooking
the risk, relying on religious beliefs and hope, and bal-
ancing their risk by emphasis on the positive social
aspects of AMA.
Educating themselves and engaging in a healthy lifestyle
Some participants spoke of gathering information to
know what actual risks are and to be prepared. Partici-
pants with low perceived risk scores and high or moder-
ate perceived control scores often reported that they had
prepared themselves for pregnancy complications to
"not be surprised by risk" (Participant 1). This 39 year-
old participant with a high perceived control score who
perceived a low risk for her pregnancy stated:
"I'm healthy, I'm fine and I've prepared myself, I've
educated myself ... Yeah I think it would be less
stressful [if I were younger] because I wouldn't have
to educate myself so much. I would have educated
myself but I feel like I had to do that extra little bit of
research because I was in that high risk group, I was
in that you know "more chance of something going
Page 8 of 13
wrong group." So I educated myself a little bit more."
(Participant 1)
These participants were also focused on improving
their lifestyle and engaging in healthy behaviors to pro-
tect their pregnancies.
Reassuring surveillance tests
Because most women were aware of the association be-
tween genetic problems and older maternal age, receiv-
ing reassuring screening test results was reported as a
relieving factor. A desire to seek actual and tangible
signs of the baby's health to confirm that "it's a normal
baby" was evident in the interviews:
"When I had one [ultrasound], and I saw that
everything was okay, he was developing okay, then I
had the tests done, the blood test, I said okay, he's a
normal baby, so I stopped worrying." (Participant 12)
Some participants chose to take screening tests as part
of their preparation to deal with anticipatory issues and
to decrease concerns related to fetal health. Based on
several participants explanations, undertaking screening
tests was a reflection of their desire to plan and be
prepared:
"We just wanted to do it for our own sake of mind,
just for our own peace of mind. I like planning my
life, I like preparing for things, I like being educated
and ready for whatever, I wanted to know, if I'm going
to have a baby with Down's syndrome. I want to know
so that I'm prepared, so that I can educate myself as
to what this baby's needs are going to be. At least if
you've prepared a little bit, you might be able to
handle it differently." (Participant 1)
Overlooking (ignoring) the risk
Some participants reported an inclination to disregard
the risk to avoid excessive stress and anxiety. In fact,
overlooking the risk was a very common approach
among our participants, even among those who edu-
cated themselves and were engaged in a healthy lifestyle:
"I've been trying not to let research or other reports
or what I read influence my way of thinking
1
know they exist, I'm not saying that ignorance is bliss,
but I just don't focus on it." (Participant 1)
The following quote from a 44 year-old participant
who had both a low perceived risk score and a low per-
ceived control score describes this approach. She and
her partner decided not to undergo genetic screening
tests.


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
"I did a fair bit of reading but then at the same time I
also got to a point where when I was pregnant I put

made sure we were eating healthy, but I mean other
than that, there's [not much] else you can do, you
can't, it's out of our control

(Participant 12)
"I do think that I would probably have more energy
ten years ago, but at the same time, emotionally, I
wasn't ready. I was immature and irresponsible still
ten years ago. Now I'm more mature and more
emotionally ready for it." (Participant 2)
Communication with health professionals
through some of those anxieties, we took all the

cases, there was not a discussion about other age-related
risks. On the other hand, most women preferred not to

described by some participants. They reported that these

and a low anxiety score commented that:

talk to him, but I didn't feel the need." (Participant 7)
Another participant with a high perceived risk score
Some women reported having negative communica-
and a moderate anxiety score expressed that her reli-
tion with health professionals, as reflected by the follow-
gious beliefs were important in how she dealt with the
ing quote from a 35 year-old participant with a low risk
risk. This participant had a low perceived control score
pregnancy:
and decided not to undergo genetic screening tests.
"I think that's a matter of our faith and our belief, um
that you know, I mean, if God created this child, if
God chooses to take this child, then that's his decision
to make and not ours, so we're not playing God by
taking that child's life." (Participant 9)
Emphasis on positive social aspects of AMA
A tendency to emphasize positive aspects of pregnancy
at older age emerged during the interviews. From some
of our participants' perspectives, an older age improved
their readiness to be a parent by having an established
"Um the lady that gave me the ultrasound I think she
was judging me a bit for being older, cause she did
ask me you know if I had taken all the extra screening
and I told her no and I don't think she was too
impressed by that ... and then
. she's like I think
people that have babies when they're really old that's
just unethical
. and so I definitely got from her that
uh you know she was judging me a bit for being older
(Participant 8)
Some participants found risk discussions with their
health care provider stressful. In reviewing participants'
relationship and career, being mature both emotionally
statements and their anxiety scores, it was apparent that
and personally, and developing problem solving skills
anxiety may influence the way a pregnant woman inter-
through having various life experiences. Our participants
preted risk information and the contents of risk commu-
weighed these advantages against biomedical risk in their
nication. The following quote was offered by a 37 year-old
risk assessment. The following quotes are from partici-
pants who had moderate perceived risk scores:

if I would prefer being pregnant [at this age] or at 24,

perceived risk score:
"I was scared after talking to the genetic counselor for

doctor's office. I was strongly encouraged to go for
genetic counseling because of my advanced age. The
terminology that the doctors and nurses and
everybody [used], advanced age, advanced age, I'm not
eighty, but okay, I suppose I'm over 35 ... And they
would show me charts, like, oh this is how your risk
increases once you've reached 35, and you kind of feel
a fear that you know something's going to go wrong
cause you're over 35. And the genetic counselor drew
all these charts and showed me my risk. But after the
genetic counseling and the results came back from all
the tests, it turns out I have an extremely low risk, so
I'm not sure why they try to scare you like that."

Discussion
The definition of risk for women of AMA, similar to
that of pregnant women of other ages [31], had a
broader scope than merely medical risks or physical
challenges and was influenced by various social and per-
sonal characteristics. The findings described above eluci-
dated that this definition also incorporates consideration
of the extent of the woman's support network, her ability
to control situations, and whether she had an established
relationship, a planned pregnancy, a flexible job or
healthy lifestyle and behavior. These findings support
the position that approaches to understanding percep-
tion of health risks should be comprehensive and broad
[8] and suggest that risk communication will benefit
from including women's criteria for defining risk.
As is the case in previous research [32], pregnancy at
AMA was frequently acknowledged by women to be
high risk due to an increased risk of genetic abnormal-
ities; however, other medical risks associated with AMA
received less consideration. In our study, the "informa-
tion quests" [32], in which women sought out a wide
range of information, were commonly reported in the
preconception period. After becoming pregnant, how-
ever, women mostly limited seeking information to avoid
increased anxiety and were focused on risk reducing be-
havior instead. In contrast to findings of Carolan & Nel-
son (2007) who reported that their Australian
participants realized they were at higher risk only after
becoming pregnant and through communication with
their health care providers, women in our study
described risks associated with AMA as "common know-
ledge in society." This finding is consistent with the find-
ing of another Canadian study [33].

Findings elucidated that nulliparous women aged
35 years or older were not a homogenous group in their
pregnancy risk assessment. The data described above
suggest that the perception of pregnancy risk may be a
result of interactions among several factors including
physiological and psychological elements, characteristics
of the experienced risk, and feedback from health care
providers. Despite the fact that our respondents were
mostly aware of risks associated with pregnancy at age
35 years or older, the majority of them did not consider
themselves to be high risk. This apparent disconnect can
be explained by the fact that people typically tend to rate
their personal risk lower in comparison to general risk
[34]. This underestimation of personal risk or "unrealis-
tic optimism" [35], might be related to one's perceived
control over a potential risk [34]. A link has been identi-
fied between perceived control and risk perception in
previous research [36]. In our study, those participants
who believed they had good control over their physical
health also perceived a lower risk for their pregnancy. It
was also noted that a woman's perceived control over
her health may be important in engaging in various
behaviors to maintain the balance between risk and
health. To support this point, a relationship between
perceived control and health service utilization has been
documented in previous research [37].
Previous prenatal loss was recently documented as a
predictor of depression and anxiety in subsequent preg-
nancies, independent of other psychosocial and obstetric
factors [38]. Our findings highlighted that having a poor
reproductive history contributes to increased perceived
risk of pregnancy. Failure to become pregnant in initial
attempts or previous loss of pregnancy may have threa-
tened these women's beliefs in their abilities to manage
their own health and may lead to increased anxiety and
higher risk perception. This statement is supported by
Campbell, Dunkel-Schetter, & Peplau (1991) who
reported that infertility may be perceived as a threat to
an infertile person's life's goals, contributing to a low
perception of control [39]. Based on our data, pregnancy
complications could alter risk perception depending on
the type of complication, its manageability, and its con-
sequences for a woman's daily life. Alternatively, good
physical health and engaging in healthy behaviors and
lifestyles were perceived as risk alleviating factors. This
finding echoes that of Gerend et al. (2004) who reported
that personal health actions from the women's perspec-
tives can reduce their risk.
Concerns about fetal health and well-being, particu-
larly genetic abnormalities, were very common among
our participants, as they have been found to be in other
studies [16,32,33,40]. Although having several fetal sur-
veillance tests helped reassure women about their baby's
health, as Baillie et al. (2000) have noted, for a number


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
of women, feelings of anxiety may remain throughout
the pregnancy [41]. Hoping for a desirable pregnancy
outcome despite having higher perceived risk and anx-
iety levels was evident in our data. This discrepancy may
lead to feelings of uncertainty. Sun et al. (2008), in a
qualitative study of women of AMA, reported similar
ambivalent and conflicted feelings, characterized by ap-
parent pleasure and hidden fear [42]. This attitude has
been referred as a "jubilant apprehension" by Yuan et al.
(2000) that describes feelings of great joy and satisfac-
tion, but also worry about childbirth outcomes [40].
Feelings of anxiety were described vaguely by our par-
ticipants and there were notable variations among parti-
cipants in expressing and wording their anxiety. This
attitude may make the detection of anxiety in these
women a challenge. There is evidence that antenatal
anxiety is very prevalent and can increase the odds of
postnatal depression [43]. Therefore, identification of
women with anxiety is crucial so that effective interven-
tions can be targeted appropriately. Healthcare providers
should be aware that some women with high levels of
anxiety tend to use different terms to communicate
these feelings. Although creating a relaxed environment
and establishing a non judgmental communication pat-
tern in prenatal care visits may be beneficial for anxious
women in disclosing their actual feelings about potential
risks, there is growing evidence suggesting that prenatal
screening should also include screening for both depres-
Sion and anxiety [44-46]. We support this perspective
and believe that using a reliable screening tool to assess
anxiety in pregnant women may be useful to identify
women who would benefit from strategies to reduce
anxiety. A recent study in Australia demonstrated that
the anxiety subscale of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depres-
Sion Scale might be a reliable measure to screen ante-
natal anxiety [45].
Women experienced a decrease in their perceived risk
with advancing gestational weeks, which could be due to
women becoming adapted to the state of being pregnant
or becoming more positive about the outcome of their
pregnancy as it advanced. An uncomplicated pregnancy
and favorable screening results may contribute to
decreased perception of risk over the course of preg-
nancy as well. A decline in worry about the baby's health
from early pregnancy to the postpartum period has been
reported in previous research [47].
Consistent with research in other fields, our results
demonstrated that pregnant women's personal or vicari-
ous experience with a risk may increase the psycho-
logical availability of the risk and consequently, its
perceived probability [48,49]. In fact, being familiar with
risk, through researching information or indirect experi-
ences, may contribute to women's risk perception. In the
literature, the perceived characteristics of the risk such
Page 11 of 13
as prevalence, controllability, preventability, and serious-
ness along with the availability and representativeness
heuristics are important elements in constructing risk
perception [35,50]. Our findings point to the predictabil-
ity of risk as a critical characteristic of risk in which pre-
dicting the risk and expecting it influenced participants'
risk perception. A risk that is expected may be perceived
as less risky than an unexpected risk, suggesting that
clear communication is essential to help women have
realistic expectations about their individual risk. A quali-
tative study by Patterson (1993) demonstrated that an
unexpected shift in health situation or pregnancy out-
comes was identified as a high risk condition by pregnant
women, while the expected changes were considered as
no risk [51]. One explanation is that anticipating the risk
and being prepared to deal with it may increase a
woman's perceived control and, consequently, decrease
her risk perception.
While discrepancies between pregnant women's and
health care providers' appraisals of risk have been docu-
mented in previous research [52-54], what appears to be
less emphasized is the influence of health care providers'
attitudes towards the risk on pregnant women's risk per-
ception. Several women in this study reported not hav-
ing any risk communication with their health care
providers that focused on age as a risk factor. This has
been interpreted by most participants as there not being
any serious concern and may imply that pregnant
women trust their health care provider's opinion. In this
regard, Heaman et al. (2004) reported that women with
or without pregnancy complications rely on their health
care providers in assessing risk status. A few participants
reported negative risk communication with their health
care providers. These participants also had higher anx-
iety and concern about the well-being of their fetus and
pregnancy outcomes. Whether risk communication pat-
terns can increase the anxiety or whether anxiety itself
will alter women's interpretation of risk communication
is not clear and needs further research. In literature, a
link between maternal depression and higher perception
of teratogenic risk has been reported [55].
Implications
In the experience of our participants, any emphasis on
the mother's good health by their care providers was
described as reassuring. Conversely, negative messages
about age by purely emphasizing pregnancy risks asso-
ciated with AMA were described as very destructive and
challenging, particularly for women with high levels of
anxiety. These findings indicate that although offering
risk information is part of the risk communication
process, the woman's mental health should be consid-
ered to avoid unnecessary stress.


Bayrampour et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012, 12:100
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2393/12/100
Comparison was a common risk appraisal strategy
among our participants. However, women's evaluations
were distinct from those of health professionals in that
the participants often compared their risk to a known
population such as their family members, friends, or
stories from real people, which is entirely different from
risks determined by epidemiological studies using popu-
lation data. This disjuncture stems at least in part from
the fact that pregnant women's understanding of risk is
mostly based on their life experiences [31,56], suggesting
that real stories can alter risk perception. This finding
has important implications for practice and public health
education. Risk must be tangible in order to be recog-
nized and potentially addressed by women. Interventions
to decrease unhealthy behaviors should target this con-
cept to alter risk perception. As Williamson & Weyman
(2005) suggested when individuals have less experience
or knowledge of risks, the media (e.g., documentary
movies) can play an important role in increasing their
understanding of those risks [57].
One of the strengths of the study was the addition of
quantitative measures (i.e., perception of pregnancy risk,
anxiety, and perceived control) and the inclusion of a
variety of perspectives from women of AMA with vary-
ing levels of risk perception, anxiety and perceived con-
trol. This diversity in the sample allowed for the
documentation of variations in risk appraisal and also
the identification of important issues that were common
across participants. Another major strength was the con-
temporaneous exploration of risk perception during the
pregnancy. It is important to consider the following lim-
itations when interpreting and applying the results. First,
our sample was representative of a middle class and
married population; these characteristics may limit the
generalization of the results. This is a small study based
on 15 interviews in one geographical area in Canada;
therefore, the results may not be generalizable to other
populations. Finally, we recognize that selection bias
may have been introduced as a purposeful sampling
method was employed and those who volunteered to
participate might have been different from those who
did not.
Conclusion
Pregnancy at age 35 years or older within a healthy con-
text and in the absence of other risk factors was per-
ceived as a low risk pregnancy by the majority of our
participants. However, in the presence of risk factors
such as pregnancy complications, limited physical activ-
ity, unfavorable screening tests results, previous poor re-
productive history, and anxiety, the risk associated with
age was highlighted, and women were inclined to
recognize their age as a risk factor for their pregnancy.
This study adds to the literature on perception of
Page 12 of 13
pregnancy risk by identifying several factors that influ-
ence the perception of pregnancy risk. Understanding of
these influential factors may help health care providers
who care for pregnant women aged 35 years or older to
gain insight into their perspectives on pregnancy risk
and improve the effectiveness of risk communication
strategies with this group.

Pregnancy related risk perception in
pregnant women, midwives & doctors: a
cross-sectional survey
Suzanne Leel*, Des Holden2, Rebecca Webbi and Susan Ayers
Abstract
Check for
updates
Background: Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a complex process influenced by multiple personal,
psychological and societal factors. Traditionally, the risk perception of healthcare professionals has been presented as
more objective and authoritative than that of pregnant women. Doctors have been presented as more concerned with
biomedical risk than midwives. Such dichotomies oversimplify and obscure the complexity of the process. This study
examines pregnancy-related risk perception in women and healthcare professionals, and what women and professionals
believe about each other's risk perception.
Methods: A cross sectional survey of set in UK maternity services. Participants were doctors working in obstetrics (N = 53),
midwives (N = 59), pregnant women (N = 68). Participants were recruited in person from two hospitals. Doctors
were also recruited online. Participants completed a questionnaire measuring the degree of perceived risk in
various childbirth-related scenarios; and the extent to which they believed others agreed with them about the degree
of risk generally involved in childbirth Main outcome measures were the degree of risk perceived to the mother in
baby in pregnancy scenarios, and beliefs about own perception of risk in comparison to their own group and other
groups.
Results: There were significant differences in total risk scores between pregnant women, doctors and midwives in
perception of risk to the mother in 68/80 scenarios. Doctors most frequently rated risks lowest. Total scores for
perceived risk to the baby were not significantly different. There was substantial variation within each group. There was
more agreement on the ranking of scenarios according to risk. Each group believed doctors perceived most
risk whereas actually doctors most frequently rated risks lowest. Each group incorrectly believed their peers
rated risk similarly to themselves.
Conclusions: Individuals cannot assume others share their perception of risk or that they make correct assessments
regarding others' risk perception. Further research should consider what factors are taken into account when making
risk assessments,
Background
Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a
complex process based on multiple factors [1, 2]. It is in-
fluenced by factors pertaining to risk perception beyond
the subject of childbirth and pregnancy-specific factors.
Factors involved in general risk perception include the
degree of perceived control involved in undertaking the
risk activity, the ways in which information about the

risk is presented, and the degree of trust placed in the
source of the information [3—5]. Factors specific to preg-
nant women include the extent to which women view
childbirth as benefitting from medical management, and
common concerns for the wellbeing of their babies [6, 7].
The two main discourses within which childbirth can
be understood also each have different approaches to
risk. The biomedical model regards birth as inherently
risky [8], whereas the social model regards pregnancy
risk as a concept constructed from multiple cultural and
personal factors [9]. Risk in the biomedical model is
generally presented in terms of potential physiological

outcomes whereas the social model recognises a more
holistic definition encompassing potential threats to
psychological and social wellbeing. In line with these
discourses, views of maternity healthcare professionals
have often been presented in a polarised fashion: typically
doctors are presented as supporting the medical model
and midwives the social model [10, 11]. Doctors' educa-
tion has frequently focussed on birth as a biomechanical
process whereas midwives may consider it in more holistic
terms [12, 13]. However, presenting these approaches as
entrenched opposites oversimplifies the issue [14]. Such
dichotomous depictions overlook the fact all healthcare
professionals are likely to be aiming to provide high qual-
ity healthcare and ensure positive outcomes [15] and may
well move along the spectrum between approaches [16].
Accounts of risk perception should also consider women's
perspectives. In contemporary Western culture, women's
understanding of birth has typically been portrayed as more
subjective and less well-informed than that of professionals
[17]. However, women's perception of risk often transcends
the medical and social models as they act from unique and
individual perspectives of their own circumstances [18]. The
portrayal of lay persons' perceptions of risk in relation to
birth has also been simplified and polarised, with profes-
sional perceptions of risk often characterised as objective
and logical, and lay assessments as more emotion-based
[19]. Again, such dichotomous terms obscure and oversim-
plify the differences and similarities of risk perception
between lay and professional groups. Perception of risk by
members of both groups will entail an assessment of numer-
ical odds but also be contingent on personal experience,
context and interactions with others [1].
However, research examining lay and medical risk per-
ception does find differences. A review of quantitative
risk perception research found little correlation between
perceptions held by healthcare professionals and of preg-
nant women with regard to pregnancy and childbirth
[20]. Qualitative research has similarly shown differences
in the way professionals and women define concepts of
risk and safety [21]. However, there is little research in
this area and existing studies have used different criteria
for assessing risk perception of professionals and women,
making them difficult to compare and reinforcing the idea
the groups assess risk in different ways.
The aim of this study is therefore to examine
pregnancy-related risk perception in women and mater-
nity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society using a unified assessment tool to enable direct
comparison, and to examine what women and profes-
sionals believe about each other's risk perception. This
study will contribute to the understanding of risk per-
ception and inform professionals seeking to understand
awareness of risk and improve communication with
pregnant women.
Method
Design
We conducted a cross-sectional study of risk perception
in regard to pregnancy and childbirth by administering a
questionnaire (see Additional file 1) to doctors, midwives
and pregnant women.
Participants
A sample of pregnant women, midwives and doctors was
recruited from two NHS Trusts (organisations providing
state-funded healthcare and utilised by the majority of the
population) in South East England. Seventy-eight pregnant
women were approached and 68 (87%) completed ques-
tionnaires. Fifty-nine midwives completed the question-
naire (16% of those approached). Initial uptake of the
study was low among doctors (n = 18, 20% of those
approached) so recruitment was extended for this group.
The final sample for analyses was 68 pregnant women, 59
midwives and 53 doctors. Doctors and midwives were
comparable in terms of time since qualification: doctors'
mean time 14.8 years (SD = 10.23; range 1 to 37 years);
midwives mean time 12.71 years (SD = 9.9; range 1 month
to 34 years; t (109) = 1.09, p = .28). The midwives worked
in obstetric units and community settings; neither trust
involved in the study has a midwifery-led unit.
Inclusion criteria for healthcare professionals were a
recognised medical or midwifery qualification and cur-
rently working as a doctor or midwife in a UK maternity
service. This allowed for participation by junior doctors
not specialising in obstetrics but currently on an obstetric
placement. Pregnant women had to be between 18 and
21 weeks pregnant and aged 18 or over to participate.
Recruitment occurred between June 2016 and April
2017. Participants were initially recruited through two
NHS trusts in South East England. However, difficulties
recruiting doctors to the study meant it was necessary to
extend recruitment to include any doctor practising
obstetrics in the UK. These additional participants were
recruited via social media and completed the study
online.
Pregnant women were approached by a researcher
while waiting for their mid-pregnancy anomaly scan. All
women in the UK are offered this scan so this time was
chosen to reach the maximum number of women. They
were given verbal and written information about the
study and reassurance about confidentiality. If they
agreed to participate, they completed the questionnaire
straight away and returned it to the researcher. Informa-
tion about the study was placed in the maternity depart-
ments for doctors and midwives along with copies of the
questionnaire for them to complete at their convenience.
Researchers also visited the maternity units to provide
further information and approach staff in person. Con-
sent, agreed as part of the ethics approval for the study,

was considered indicated by completion of the question-
naire. All participants received information about the
study explaining the procedure.
Measures
The questionnaire consisted of two elements. The first
measured risk in relation to pregnancy and childbirth sce-
narios (80 items) and was adapted from the work of Gray
[22], a who used a similar scale to measure risk perception
in relation to hospitalisation in pregnancy. Each item in the
first element briefly described a pregnancy or birth sce-
nario, e.g. 'a woman who has a minor postpartum haemor-
rhage at home', 'a woman giving birth in a birthpool in
hospital'. Participants were asked to rate how much risk
they perceived each scenario represented to the wellbeing
of (i) the mother and (ii) the fetus/baby. Participants were
provided with a definition of risk as 'a possible degree of
threat to physical or psychological wellbeing. This defin-
ition was intended to allow participants to formulate their
own interpretations of scenarios as far as possible. Three
obstetricians, three midwives and six pregnant women
assisted in the development and piloting of the question-
naire to ensure user acceptability and face validity.
All participants received the same questionnaire but the
version for pregnant women also included definitions of
medical terms (e.g. shoulder dystocia, pre-eclampsia, etc.)
taken from the NHS Choices or Royal College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynaecologists websites. Participants indicated
the degree of risk perceived using a visual analogue scale:
a 100 mm line representing a continuum from 'minimal
risk' to 'extreme risk'. The distance from the beginning of
the scale to participants' marks was measured and the
resulting millimetre measurement became the risk score
for each question (minimum score = O; maximum score =
100). Risks to mother and baby were scored separately,
providing total possible risk scores of 8000 for risk to
mother and 8000 for risk to baby (80 scenarios, maximum
score 100 per scenario).
The second element looked at participants' comparison
of their own perceived risk with other groups (3 items).
Participants were asked to compare the extent to which
they believed others agreed with them about the degree of
risk generally involved in pregnancy and birth. A seven
point Likert scale was used ranging from (1) 'they think it
is a lot less risky than I do' to (7) 'they think it is a lot
more risky than I do'. A score of 4 therefore indicated they
believed the comparison group agreed with them about
the degree of risk. Participants first compared themselves
with members of their own group (other doctors, mid-
wives or pregnant women) and then with the remaining
two groups.
The primary outcomes were degree of perceived risk,
and perception of own sense of risk in comparison to
others in their own group and other groups.

Sample size calculations based on the likelihood of
detecting a medium effect size estimated a sample of 53
doctors, 53 midwives and 53 pregnant women was needed
for the study to be adequately powered to find a difference
in the primary outcomes (power = 0.8, significance = .05).
Doctors and midwives were also asked how long they
had held their medical or midwifery qualification.
Analysis
Analysis was conducted using SPSS version 23 [23].
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene's tests were conducted
to test for normal distribution and homogeneity of vari-
ance. ANOVA was used to test for differences in total
scores between groups. The data were found to be skewed
for scores on individual items so the non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for differences between
the groups.
Results
Doctors', midwives' and pregnant women's total mean
scores of overall perceived risk to the mother and baby
are shown in Table 1.
Overall mean risk scores were low to moderate for
mother and baby, ranging from 3127.64—3776.94 from a
possible score of 8000. Doctors reported the lowest
mean scores. There were significant differences between
groups for risk to the mother but not for risk to the
baby. Post hoc tests revealed significant differences for
perceived risk to the mother between doctors and mid-
wives (mean difference 559.3, SE 211.05, p = .02) and
doctors and pregnant women (mean difference 524.13,
SE 208.01, p = .03) but not between midwives and preg-
nant women (mean difference 35.18. SE 183.64, p = .98).
Across individual risk scenarios however, there was little
agreement between the groups on the perceived degree of
risk (see Additional file 2). Regarding risk to the mother,
68 scenarios (85%) showed significant differences between
the groups (p < .05) and only 12 (15%) showed no signifi
cant differences in risk scores (p = .077—.576). There was
also little agreement in scores on risk to the baby: 58 sce-
narios (73%) showed a significant difference between the
groups (p < .05) and 22 scenarios (27%) showed no signifi
cant differences (p = .051—.724). Of the 12 scenarios which
showed no difference in risk scores for risk to the mother,
11 of these also showed no difference for risk to the baby.
In scenarios where there was a difference between risk
scores, doctors consistently rated the risk lowest. With
regards to risks to the mother, doctors rated the risks
lowest for the majority of scenarios where there was a
significant difference between groups (56 times out of
68). There was a similar picture with scores of risk to
the baby where doctors rated the risks lowest for the
majority of scenarios where there was a significant dif-
ference between groups (41 times out of 58). Pregnant

women rated the most scenarios the highest (mothers'
risk 39 of 68; babies' risk 30 of 58). Midwives rated
slightly fewer scenarios highest (mothers' risk 32 of 68;
babies' risk 28 of 58). Doctors' ratings of risk were high-
est only once for mothers' risk and once for babies' risk.
However, although there was variation between groups
in the risk scores assigned to the mothers and babies in
the scenarios, there were similarities across the groups
when the scenarios were ranked in order of degree of
perceived risk. The 10 highest ranking scenarios are
shown in Table 2 for risk to mothers and Table 3 for
risk to babies. Six scenarios were consistently rated high-
est for risk to the mother by participants in all three
groups. Four scenarios were consistently rated highest
risk to the baby by participants in all three groups. Thus
while there was frequent disagreement about the degree
of risk posed in each scenario, there was more consensus
about the scenarios that posed the greatest risk to
mothers and babies.
Mean scores for participants' estimations of how their
peers and members of the other groups would rate risk in
comparison to their own ratings are displayed in Table 4.
Each group believed their peers agreed with them about
the degree of risk generally involved in pregnancy and
childbirth. Doctors believed midwives perceived birth as a
little less risky than they did and pregnant women per-
ceived it as somewhat less risky. Midwives believed doc-
tors perceived pregnancy and birth as somewhat more
risky and pregnant women as a little less risky than they
did. Pregnant women believed doctors agreed with them
about the degree of risk involved in pregnancy and birth.
Their mean score for comparison with midwives fell
between midwives believing birth is a little less risky and
agreeing with the degree of risk.

This study aimed to examine risk perception in relation
to pregnancy and childbirth in pregnant women and ma-
ternity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society, and to examine what pregnant women and pro-
fessionals believe about the risk perceptions of each
other. Results showed there were differences in risk per-
ception in relation to pregnancy and birth within and
between pregnant women, doctors and midwives. When
rating risk of different scenarios to mothers, there were
significant differences between pregnant women, doctors
and midwives for 68 out of 80 pregnancy-related scenar-
iOS. This was less marked when rating risks for babies
where overall mean risk scores were not significantly dif-
ferent between groups, but there were differences in the
scores of 58 out of 80 scenarios. While assessments of
the degree of risk pertaining to scenarios differed, there
was more agreement on the ranking of scenarios accord-
ing to risk. Interestingly, when comparing their own rat-
ings of risk to others, each group incorrectly believed
their peers rated risk similarly to themselves. These
beliefs were not supported by the first part of the study.
The mean risk score for each group, and in particular
the doctors, had large standard deviations, indicating a
wide range of scores within groups (see Table 1). Each
group also believed doctors perceived most risk in preg-
nancy and birth. However, where there were significant
differences in scores for individual scenarios, where doc-
tors consistently rated the risks lower than women and
midwives.in The results of this study are consistent with
previous research showing pregnant women think about
risk differently to healthcare professionals. It showed
pregnant women had the highest risk perception scores.

risk, especially concerning the birth process and the
wellbeing of their babies [24]. While this may appear
concerning, these fears are not necessarily perceived
negatively by women however and, though common, are
often not perceived as very intense or intrusive. They
may be viewed as an integral part of pregnancy which
confers an element of protection by motivating women
to speak out about their concerns [25]. Thus while
women acknowledge pregnancy and birth may involve a
degree of risk they also utilise psychological strategies to
manage these concerns and may tolerate greater degrees
of risk than professionals recommend, or would be pre-
pared to tolerate for themselves, if they believe doing so
will result in a better outcome for themselves and their
babies [26, 27]. Within the professionals' risk assess-
ments, midwives also rated risks to mothers significantly
higher than doctors. While midwifery care is based on
the assumption and promotion of normality in preg-
nancy, much midwifery activity is focussed on concerns
regarding the abnormal so creating a degree of tension
and disjunction between rhetoric and practice [28, 29].
This study found differences between the risk percep-
tion of pregnant women and healthcare professionals. It
was beyond the scope of the study to investigate potential
reasons for these differences but they have traditionally
been attributed to women's more subjective, less
knowledge-based understanding of risk [17, 19]. However,
such a distinction may be misplaced; emotion, imagination
and intuition are components of all perceptions of risk
and so are likely to influence women and professionals
alike alongside an assessment of objective knowledge [30,
31]. Healthcare professionals have been shown to consider

the degree of the patient's anxiety, their own clinical ex-
perience, particularly that based on borderline or espe-
cially interesting cases and negative outcomes, and the
opinions of trusted colleagues when making decisions re-
garding risk [32, 33]. They actively interpret evidence-
based guidelines according to their own and the patient's
individual circumstances rather than follow them abso-
lutely. Rather than differentiating between lay (subjective,
inferior) and professional (objective, authoritative) under-
standing of risk, it may be more appropriate to acknow-
ledge both groups rely on different types of understanding:
systematic, intuitive, experiential and tacit, when making
judgements about risk [34]. Further research is needed to
establish how maternity professionals combine subjective
and objective elements of risk perception. It may also be
the case that doctors become habituated to situations in-
volving greater degrees of risk as they make up the majority
of their practice and utilise their obstetric skills.
The midwives and doctors in this study demonstrated
some differences in risk perception. Perceived differences
in approach to risk have been shown to be a factor which
can lead to tension between maternity care professionals
and feelings of lack of trust and support [35]. Such tension
maybe interpreted as conflict by service users and cause
them some anxiety [36]. The members of each group in
this study believed their peers agreed with them about the
degree of risk involved in pregnancy and childbirth,
although the results did not support this belief. In all com-
munication, individuals typically overestimate the extent
to which others share their beliefs and interpretation of
events [37]. This false consensus effect is particularly
evident in situations deemed important, in this instance

healthcare. These factors can lead to misinterpreted com-
munication and conflict [38] so maternity care profes-
sionals should be aware of their potential influence in
communication with members of their own discipline as
well as others and pregnant women.
This study demonstrates risk perception in relation to
pregnancy and birth is a complex and individual process.
It challenges the stereotypical depictions of doctors and
midwives in regard to their perception of risk. This has
implications for how professionals perceive their own and
others' roles, and how they communicate with each other
and with women in their care. Traditional distinctions
between the quality of professional and lay approaches to
risk oversimplify the process and may devalue women's
understanding of their circumstances and contribution to
their car [14]. Recognising all parties have a common goal
and speaking openly about factors influencing risk percep-
tion may enhance relationships with women and col-
leagues [39]. This in turn has been demonstrated to have
a positive effect on outcomes for women and babies [40].
This is the first study to explore the risk perception of
doctors, midwives and pregnant women using a compar-
able measure. It adds to the understanding of how the
different groups assess risk, their beliefs about the risk per-
ception of their peers and others, and has implications
regarding communication within and between groups. It
will contribute to the understanding of risk perception and
the conceptualisation of risk. It will increase knowledge of
risk perception in different groups and their beliefs about
each other, and challenge unhelpful stereotypes. It will
inform professionals working in maternity care and seeking
to understand awareness of risk and improve communica-
tion with pregnant women, and provide information for
women utilising maternity care.
Strengths of this study include using the same mea-
sures for each group to allow direct comparisons of risk
perception across groups. The study was developed with
input from maternity service users, obstetricians and
midwives, ensuring its credibility and acceptability. The
sampling strategy ensured the inclusion of pregnant
women with different degrees and experiences of risk in
their own pregnancies and healthcare professionals
working in different areas of maternity care with varying
lengths of time qualified to provide a range of potential
perspectives on risk. A limitation of the study was the dif-
ficulty recruiting doctors and need to include participants
recruited online. The final sample therefore included doc-
tors from other areas so the group was potentially more
heterogeneous and self-selected than were the groups of
pregnant women and midwives. The relatively small num-
bers of doctors and midwives who ultimately participated
in the study mean further work is needed to establish how
representative their perceptions of risk are and the extent
to which the findings are generalisable. Although efforts
Page 6 of 8
were made to ensure face validity, the questionnaire has
not been formally validated so further work is needed to
establish the extent to which it accurately represents per-
ception of risk and the extent to which these perceptions
manifest in behaviour. Finally, between-group differences
were tested for all 80 individual scenarios and multiple
comparisons increase the probability that some of the
significant findings occurred by chance. It is therefore
important to replicate and extend this research.
Conclusions
Assessment of risk is a complex activity comprised of
objective and subjective elements. All individuals making
an assessment of risk will rely on these elements to dif-
fering extents depending on the particular context. Indi-
viduals cannot assume others share their perception of
risk or that they make correct assessments regarding the
risk perception of others.
Healthcare professionals should be aware of these con-
siderations when communicating with pregnant women,
and also with other professionals. Communication with
women should include sensitive and respectful exploration
of their understanding and perception of risk and safety,
and acknowledgement of any anxieties. When communi-
cating with members of their own discipline, professionals
should not make assumptions that colleagues will share
their perceptions. They should be mindful of the subject-
ivity of their own risk assessments and factors which may
influence their perceptions rather than attempting to elim-
inate or deny the effects of some of these influences. They
should challenge their own and others' stereotypical
assumptions about the perception of risk in other disci-
plines, and ensure interdisciplinary communication is
based on professional respect and genuine understanding.
Further research is needed to consider what factors
professionals and pregnant women take into account
when making risk assessments in relation to pregnancy
and birth and how they use these factors to formulate
their assessments. It should also examine which ele-
ments of pregnancy and birth are perceived as most
risky, what it is about them which causes concern, and
the extent to which evidence exists to support these
perceptions. Qualitative research should explore health-
care professionals' and pregnant women's understanding
and awareness of their perceptions of risk. Research is
needed to establish how perception of risk influences
professionals' communication with women, the barriers
to effective risk communication, and how this communi-
cation can be improved. Research into interprofessional
working should explore how stereotypical expectations
about the risk perception of other groups arise, can
be challenged, and communication between disciplines
improved.

Chapter 22
Overdose Risks and Prevention
Strategies for Pregnant Women in
New York City
Bethany Medley
Introduction
Like many countries around the world, the United States is in the midst of an
overdose crisis. Since 1999, an estimated 700,000 people in the United States have
died of an overdose with the majority of those deaths involving opioids (Center
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2018). While men account for a greater num-
ber of overdose fatalities, the prevalence of overdose is increasing more rapidly
among women of reproductive age (Mazure & Fiellin, 2018). Additionally, preg-
nant and parenting women are more susceptible to unique risk factors compared
to their male counterparts, such as limited access to reproductive healthcare,
stressful child welfare interventions, and increased stigma within healthcare set-
tings. Although harm reduction services including overdose prevention emphasise
compassionate and evidence-based approaches for mitigating drug-related harm,
these services services are rarely designed with the various needs of pregnant
and parenting women in mind. Gender-responsive harm reduction approaches
must take into account factors within the nexus of relevant social systems (i.e.
the criminal justice system, women's healthcare, and the child welfare system).
Developing harm reduction and overdose prevention strategies for women of
reproductive age who may experience pregnancy during their drug use trajectory
is a critical area of need that require collaborative efforts with those with lived
experience. Using excerpts from interviews with three women who had experi-
enced pregnancy and drug use in New York City, this chapter seeks to highlight

the importance of inclusive gender-responsive overdose prevention and shared
expertise from those with lived experience.
Women Who Use Drugs as Overdose Responders
The widespread availability of naloxone, the medication used to reverse an opioid
overdose, is essential in curbing the current opioid overdose crisis. Naloxone is
safe and has no potential for abuse, so there is little to no risks in allowing non-
medical personnel to administer the medication (Burris, Norland, & Edlin, 2001).
Research shows that training and distribution of naloxone to individuals likely
to witness an overdose can significantly reduce overdose mortality (Siegler et al.
2017). New York City has made laudable efforts to increase naloxone training
and distribution to relevant community-based organisations in order to make this
available to those that need it the most — people who use drugs. One participant
shared her expertise as an overdose responder:
I don't panic under pressure. I'm that person that remembers all
the steps, you know. I can delegate, you know, 'You, call 911. You,
uh, you know, help me with um, you know, CPR' if we have to
do it, because we had to at that point. She wasn't breathing. So
compressions and breaths and all that. It- it's helpful when you
have the ability to recruit people into your situation. And as long
as you're giving, you know, concise, clear instructions, people are
okay. You know what I mean? If you're, like, freaking out, then it
can turn into a shit show pretty quickly.
In 2018, New York City dispensed 95,051 naloxone rescue kits to community
members via registered Opioid Overdose Prevention Programs (New York City
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2018). A significant number of nalox-
one rescue kits are dispensed to harm reduction settings. Harm reduction settings
are designed to provide low threshold, overdose prevention education to people in
the community actively using drugs. Harm reduction programmes often operate
in a peer-based, non-judgmental environment. Harm reduction programmes, also
known as syringe access programmes, may also provide other drug user health
resources such as sterile drug consumption equipment, fentanyl testing strips, con-
doms, HIV and Hepatitis C testing, or low-threshold access to buprenorphine.
All of the women interviewed were connected to harm reduction services in some
capacity as participants or employees.
At the time of this publication, drug consumption spaces, also known as super-
vised injection facilities, were not allowed to operate legally in the United States. As
a result, public bathrooms have often been used as convenient locations for people
to inject drugs due to the privacy, availability, immediacy, and resources (i.e. water,
lighting, and flat surfaces). Thus, it is common for people to use drugs in busi-
ness locations with private bathroom facilities (Wolfson-Stofko, Bennett, Elliott,
& Curtis, 2017). Recognising the overdose risk in many neighbourhoods with high
rates of drug use within her community, one participant took it upon herself to
educate local business owners on overdose prevention with the use of naloxone.


Overdose Risks and Prevention Strategies for Pregnant Women
I've talked to, like, McDonald's employers, employees, and, um, it's
important that they have it, in case they stumble upon somebody in
their public bathroom and that, you know, that's clearly, because of
the equipment on the floor or whatever, suffering from an overdose.
Like, dude, administer. You can't hurt them. You're not gonna make
a mistake. Call 911, administer, and have somebody else help you.

The psychological effects of responding to an overdose for women who use drugs
including the benefits and harms of such an experience are an under-researched
topic in overdose prevention literature. Participants reported a a feeling of personal
responsibility to respond to an overdose within their community. Not only did their
fostered connections at harm reduction programmes provide a supportive social
environment and access to resources, but their involvement also provided a benefit to
share overdose prevention education among their peers and community. Taking on
the social role of responding to an overdose has shown to provide valuable, empow-
ering skill sets that include increasing the sense of self-confidence and self-esteem
(Wagner et al., 2014). At the same time, certain negative psychological consequences
should be considered when examining the impact of being an overdose responder
among people who use drugs. Research shows the risks of burnout and trauma
among community-based responders is rarely considered in current programmatic
support (Shearer, Fleming, Fowler, Boyd, & Mcneil, 2018). Reflecting on experiences
as community-based overdose responders, participants shared their thoughts:
I don't want to lose a loved one. I don't want to lose a best friend.
I don't want to lose anybody, even if it is a perfect stranger to
know that I could have done something and that I didn't.
I've always been a part of the user community. And I feel that they
have user rights and that they should be supported in their use.
They should be supported in any changes they want to make. They
should be supported, period. They're human beings.
Barriers to Care for Pregnant Women Who Use Drugs
My water broke on the bus .
I feel like 'I'm pissing myself but I'm
not even peeing'. So I went to the doctor and they said, 'You know
that you're five months pregnant?' And I was like, 'What? I'm five
months pregnant!?'
Sometimes these things just happen because you have, like, lesser
periods or no periods because of your usage. Like, it's hard to tell
when you're fucking pregnant to begin with. And morning sick-
ness and dope sickness resembles, you know, so you wind up being
many months pregnant when you finally figure it out. You know,
that's what happened to me every time.
As the testimonies above illustrate, unexpected pregnancies are common among
women who use opioids (Heil et al. , 2011). Drug use, especially consistent opioid use,


198 Bethany Medley
may delay or stop menstrual cycles. Additionally, early pregnancy symptoms (i.e.
vomiting, cramping, and nausea) may be difficult for women who are depend-
ent on opioids to differentiate from withdrawal symptoms (Jones et al., 2008).
Furthermore, stigmatisation practices towards people who use drugs are common
in healthcare settings (Corrigan, Kuwabara, & O' Shaughnessy, 2009; Mendiola,
Galetto, & Fingerhood, 2018). While research is limited on the impacts of stigma in
healthcare settings among pregnant women who use drugs, the participants inter-
viewed for this chapter emphasised their experiences of being stigmatised as a lead-
ing factor in preventing initial or continued engagement in care.
They actually treated me like crap when I told them what my
problem was. They didn't even want to help me, they didn't want
to hear me. All they cared about was, um, and I understand, but
all they cared about was the baby, the baby, the baby, the baby,
but okay, if the baby is the baby, the baby, the baby, what about
hydrating me so that the baby is well, you know?
Um, it was traumatic. I mean, he was preemie. The nurses were super
mean to me at the hospital. You know, every time I would go and,
and visit, you know, he was in an incubator. I could barely touch
him. They'd look at me and they'd be like, 'Look at him. Look, look
at what you did to your son.' So it was fucked up. My mom visited
him more in the hospital than I did. I just couldn't bear to take my,
you know, to go, because they were just so fucking mean.
Like, at one point I seriously, like, like, thought about just giving
birth at home. Seriously. For fear of them taking my child away at
the hospital when, and because of the usage and, like, you know,
once you're in the hospital setting, like, you can't just leave. You
can't leave with your child. They're gonna take the child because
they're gonna test their first urine. And, and it's downhill from
there. I have no faith in the you know, child protective services
people. They're liars. They, you know, they, they set you up, I,
I think, for, for failure. So I really considered just having my baby at
home and trying to, you know, Google that shit, like, how to have
a home birth. Yeah. That's how, how fearful I was of, of losing yet
again another child and not having family there for the support.
In addition to the experience of being stigmatised in healthcare settings, the
threat of child welfare involvement or possible criminalisation is also a the real-
ity for women who use drugs. The United States has an extensive history of puni-
tive laws towards women who use drugs during pregnancy laws that are primarily
implemented through policing, surveillance, and child removal by the state. Cur-
rently, punitive laws far outnumber the existing evidence-based, supportive policies
(Thomas TrefTers, Berglas, Drabble, & Roberts, 2018). While no law currently exists
explicitly criminalising drug use during pregnancy, states have sought prosecution
against pregnant people who use drugs in a variety of ways such as declaring prenatal


Overdose Risks and Prevention Strategies for Pregnant Women 199
drug use as a form of child maltreatment, doing drug testing without informed con-
sent, ordering treatment through civil commitment, and mandating child welfare
notifications (Thomas Treffers, Berglas, Drabble, & Roberts, 2018). While an analysis
of the extent of these punitive policies is beyond the scoop of this article, it is clear
that many of these policies violate basic human rights of pregnant women who use
drugs. Notably, the overwhelming majority of parents involved in drug-related child
welfare investigations are primarily low income and disproportionately women of
colour (Stone, 2015). There is no evidence that prosecution or the threat of prosecu-
tion deters drug use in pregnancy (Patrick & Schiff, 2017). In fact, research shows
that the threat of child welfare involvement instead deters many women from seek-
ing healthcare including prenatal care, supportive social structures, evidenced-based
drug treatment, or overdose prevention (Hui, Angelotta, & Fisher, 2017; Nielsen
et al., 2019; Stone, 2015). However, opioid use during pregnancy is an easily treatable,
temporary, and non-life-threatening condition with no evidence of long-term health
consequences for the newborn (Mangat, Schmölzer, & Kraft, 2019). Thus, punitive
measures are counterproductive to the health of pregnant women and newborns.
Because I think they're at higher risk for overdose because they use
alone, they use in secrecy. Um, you know, the baby is, is, you know,
pretty much taking half of what is going in their system, so they're
feeling the effects less, so they, they might increase their amount of
usage, which puts them at a higher risk of overdose.
The participant's statement above noted several important overdose risk con-
siderations specifically for drug-using pregnant women — an often overlooked
population in overdose prevention education. While there is extensive research
in treating opioid use disorder during pregnancy with the use of buprenorphine
or methadone — which is also shown to significantly reduce the risk of an opioid
overdose — little research exists on responding to an opioid overdose to a preg-
nant person with the use of naloxone (World Health Organization (WHO), 2014).
There is a critical need to expand overdose prevention education for the pregnant
population. Women who are pregnant may use alone due to increased stigma by
drug-using peers, partners, or family members. Using alone poses a significant
risk of dying from an overdose, since it is unlikely that a bystander could intervene
with the use of naloxone. To be clear, naloxone should always be administered to
anyone experiencing an overdose, regardless of pregnancy (Blandthorn, Bowman,
Leung, Bonomo, & Dietze, 2017). While none of the interviewed participants had
heard anything about specific considerations when administering naloxone to a
pregnant woman — a frequent inquiry at overdose prevention trainings — all par-
ticipants were correct when assuming pregnancy should never be a reason not to
give someone naloxone based on the medication's life-saving purpose.
But it's better to have someone alive, whether they're pregnant or
not, than to have someone, two people dead ... as opposed to two
people, the mother overdosing and the fetus dying in the process.
Additionally, the postpartum period creates a unique overdose risk for women
who have experienced pregnancy. The limited research suggests that some factors


200 Bethany Medley
associated with overdose in the postpartum period include poor social sup-
port, inadequate healthcare coverage, and recently having an infant experienc-
ing neonatal abstinence syndrome (Nielsen et al., 2019). Similarly, women may
self-medicate with continued or increased drug use due to stress and trauma asso-
ciated with the loss of child custody or child welfare involvement, as one partici-
pant described:
The pregnancies where I was using probably increased after birth
only because of the, you know, just the shitty feeling, the depres-
Sion associated with the fact that I knew that I wouldn't be able to
take my baby home or be with my baby.
Conclusion
This brief documentation sheds light on women not only surviving the overdose
crisis but also the punitive, stigmatising multi-structural social systems that often
affect intersecting with the lives of pregnant women who use drugs. Several areas
of further research and programme development were highlighted including the
need for gender-responsive overdose prevention provisions, barriers to reproduc-
tive health and harm reduction, as well as effective interventions with supportive,
trauma-informed approaches. Women who use drugs have proven their expertise
in identifying several devastatingly harmful barriers to their own care and criti-
cal life-saving interventions. Policymakers, researchers, and practitioners need to
ensure that women are no longer adversely impacted by ineffective and harmful
policies and practices, which can be accomplished by collectively increasing advo-
cacy efforts to promote the inclusive involvement of women with lived experience
of pregnancy and drug use throughout the development, evaluation, and imple-
mentation of impacting systems and policies.

Original Investigation
Maternal and Neonatal Morbidity and Mortality Among Pregnant Women With and Without COVID-19 Infection
818
t the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the precise ex-
tent of the risks in pregnancy was uncertain, which was
affecting pregnant individuals' mental health.1'2
The lack of clarity arose because, in an early systematic
review,3 only 4 studies that involved small numbers com-
pared outcomes between pregnant women with and without
COVID-19.4-7 The question is relevant because of the known
deleterious effects of other coronavirus infections in preg-
nancy (eg, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East
respiratory syndrome). 8 Therefore, the INTERGROWTH-21st
Consortium conducted a prospective, longitudinal, observa-
tional study (INTERCOVID), involving 43 hospitals in 18 coun-
tries, to assess the association between COVID-19 and mater-
nal and neonatal outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19
diagnosis, compared with concomitantly enrolled pregnant
women without COVID-19 diagnosis.
Methods
Study Design
The Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee and all local
ethics committees approved the study, which did not inter-
fere with clinical management. Informed consent (oral or writ-
ten) was obtained from study participants according to local
requirements, except when a waiver/exemption of such con-
sent was granted by a local committee. We adhered to the
Declaration of Helsinki9 and Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines. The study protocol, including the laboratory tests used,
has been previously published.10
For 8 months from March 2, 2020, we enrolled women 18
years or older at any stage of pregnancy or delivery with the
diagnosis ofCOVID-19 during the present pregnancy based on
laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 and/or radiologic pul-
monary findings suggestive of COVID-1911 or 2 or more pre-
defined COVID-19 symptoms. A range of different real-time
polymerase chain reaction and antibody tests were used at par-
ticipating institutions (eBox in the Supplement). Two imme-
diately concomitant pregnant women 18 years or older with-
out any of those diagnostic criteria were enrolled per woman
with COVID-19 diagnosis to create an unbiased sample of all
pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis in these insti-
tutions. Women were enrolled from 43 institutions in 18 coun-
tries (Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, France, Ghana, India, Indone-
sia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Nigeria, North Macedonia, Pakistan,
Russia, Spain, Switzerland, UK, and the US). Data on race were
not collected.
When a woman with a COVID-19 diagnosis was identified
antenatally, 2 women without COVID-19 diagnosis of similar
gestational age (±2 weeks) receiving standard antenatal care
were enrolled that day. If not possible or ifthose women with-
out COVID-19 diagnosis were lost to follow-up, we enrolled 2
women without COVID-19 diagnosis who delivered immedi-
ately after the woman with COVID-19 diagnosis. The same se-
lection strategy was used when a woman with COVID-19 di-
agnosis was identified at hospital admission and delivery
was likely during that admission. Ifa woman without COVID-19
diagnosis declined participation, the next woman was ap-

Key Points
Question To what extent does COVID-19 in pregnancy alter the
risks of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes compared with
pregnant individuals without COVID-19?
Findings In this multinational cohort study of 2130 pregnant
women in 18 countries, women with COVID-19 diagnosis were at
increased risk of a composite maternal morbidity and mortality
index. Newborns of women with COVID-19 diagnosis had
significantly higher severe neonatal morbidity index and severe
perinatal morbidity and mortality index compared with newborns
of women without COVID-19 diagnosis.
Meaning This study indicates a consistent association between
pregnant individuals with COVID-19 diagnosis and higher rates of
adverse outcomes, including maternal mortality, preeclampsia,
and preterm birth compared with pregnant individuals without
COVID-19 diagnosis.
proached until 2 women without COVID-19 diagnosis were en-
rolled per woman with COVID-19 diagnosis. We sought con-
firmation from a biweekly random 10% sample that the 2
women without COVID-19 diagnosis were appropriately cho-
sen; we excluded 5 women who had a COVID-19 diagnosis and
the corresponding 10 women without a COVID-19 diagnosis,
without such confirmation. Live and stillborn singleton and
multiple pregnancies were included, including those with con-
genital anomalies. However, in keeping with reporting require-
ments during the pandemic, 12 we excluded women/neonates
from the final analysis if their data were already published in
any comparative study with women without COVID-19

Outcomes
The primary outcomes24 were 3 unweighted indices: (1) ma-
ternal morbidity and mortality index including at least 1 of the
following pregnancy-related morbidities: third-trimester vagi-
nal bleeding, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia/

standards25 or, if early ultrasonography dating was not car-
ried out, the best obstetric estimate was used based on all clini-
cal and ultrasonography data available at the time of deliv-
ery. Newborn weight, length, and head circumference at birth
were assessed against the international INTERGROWTH-21st
standards .26
Data Management and Statistical Analysis
We used a centrally coordinated data management system de-
veloped for the INTERGROWTH-21st Project (MedSciNet).27 As-
sociations between being diagnosed as having COVID-19 and
morbidity/mortality indices expressed as binary outcomes
were assessed using Poisson models with a log link function
and robust standard errors expressed as relative risk (RR) and
95% Cl. Associations with number of days in ICU were as-
sessed using negative binomial models with robust standard
errors (expressed as an incidence rate ratio and 95% CI). We
set statistical significance at P < .05. Models for our primary
outcomes were adjusted for country, month entering study, ma-
ternal age, and history of maternal morbidity (including dia-
betes, thyroid, and other endocrine disorders; cardiac dis-
ease; hypertension; chronic respiratory disease; kidney disease;
malaria; or tuberculosis). Models with preterm birth as an out-
come were also adjusted for previous preterm birth. We plotted
Kaplan-Meier curves with the percentage of women remain-
ing pregnant by gestational age to compare the distributions
between women with and without COVID-19 diagnosis, ac-
cording to symptom status. We evaluated women with
COVID-19 diagnosis for the primary and secondary outcomes
using the women without COVID-19 diagnosis as the refer-
ence group. We further categorized women with COVID-19 di-
agnosis as asymptomatic or symptomatic based on type and
duration of symptoms, as well as according to past maternal
morbidity and normal weight or overweight to explore effect
modification. We assessed the association of neonates test-
ing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. In separate sensitivity
analyses, we adjusted for additional potential confounders, re-
stricted the definition of women with COVID-19 diagnosis to
mothers with a positive laboratory test result, and excluded
twins. We also performed separate meta-analyses for our pri-
mary outcomes of interest using the stratified results to esti-
mate pooled effects and assess heterogeneity by country.
Results
We enrolled 706 women with COVID-19 diagnosis, of which
656 (92.9%) had laboratory/radiological confirmation and 50
(7.1%) had more than 2 symptoms without laboratory confir-
mation. Of those who tested positive, almost exclusively (640
of 652 [98.1%]) by real-time polymerase chain reaction, 287
(44.0%) were asymptomatic. We also enrolled 1424 women
without COVID-19 diagnosis (eFigure in the Supplement). The
groups of women with and without diagnosis had similar
demographic characteristics. However, 48.6% (n = 323) of the
group with COVID-19 diagnosis had overweight early in preg-
nancy compared with 40.2% (n = 554) of the group without
COVID-19 diagnosis. Women with COVID-19 diagnosis had a

higher rate of recreational drug use but lower rate of smoking
during the index pregnancy, higher rates of previous preterm
birth, stillbirth, neonatal death, and preexisting medical con-
ditions (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
During the index pregnancy, women with a COVID-19 di-
agnosis had higher rates of pregnancy-induced hypertension
(RR, 1.46; 95% Cl, 1.05-2.02), preeclampsia/eclampsia (RR, 1.76;
95% CI, 1.27-2.43), and infections requiring antibiotics
(RR, 3.38; 95% CI, 1.63-7.01), and there was an association with
a greater risk of admission to ICU/high-dependency unit
(RR, 5.04; 95% CI, 3.13-8.10) and referral to a higher level of
care (RR, 6.07; 95% Cl, 1.23-30.01). Among all ICU admis-
sions, women with COVID-19 diagnosis stayed 3.73 (95% CI,
2.37-5.86) days longer than women without COVID-19 diag-
nosis (Table 1).
Eleven women (1.6%) with COVID-19 diagnosis died (ma-
ternal mortality ratio, 159/10 000 births). Of these, 4 had se-
vere preeclampsia (1 superimposed on chronic hypertension
and 1 associated with cardiomyopathy); 3 of these 4 women
had respiratory failure that required mechanical ventilation and
the fourth woman died of a pulmonary embolism. Five women
had worsening respiratory failure antenatally, 2 of whom un-
derwent cesarean delivery and, despite intensive respiratory
support, died later. The remaining 2 women developed fever,
cough, and breathlessness within 7 days of an uneventful de-
livery and died shortly after, despite ICU care. In the group of
women without COVID-19 diagnosis, there was 1 death due to
preexisting liver malignant neoplasm and cirrhosis. Thus,
women with COVID-19 diagnosis were 22 times more likely to
die (RR, 22.3; 95% Cl, 2.88-172), although the CIs were wide
owing to the small numbers (Table 1).
Overall, women with COVID-19 diagnosis had a lower rate
of spontaneous initiation of labor but higher cesarean deliv-
ery rate, reflecting the higher rates of pregnancy complica-
tions in this group. They also had higher RRs for preterm birth
and fetal distress of 1.59 (95% Cl, 1.30-1.94) and 1.70 (95% Cl,
1.06-2.75), respectively. Overall, 83% ofpreterm births (n = 130)
in women with COVID-19 diagnosis were medically indi-
cated; hence, the increased risk in this group (RR, 1.97;
95% CI, 1.56-2.51) (Table 1). The leading indications for pre-
term delivery among women with COVID-19 diagnosis were
preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP (31[24.7%]), small for gesta-
tional age (24[15.5%]), and fetal distress (17[13.2%]). The pro-
portions of spontaneous preterm birth were similar. Women
with COVID-19 diagnosis had a higher low birth weight rate
(RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.29-1.94). The rates of prelabor rupture of
membranes were similar in both groups (Table 1). Fully ad-
justing models of our primary outcomes for all planned vari-
ables reduced the sample size owing to missing data, but af-
fected the results minimally (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Women with COVID-19 diagnosis delivered earlier than
those without COVID-19 diagnosis after approximately 30
weeks' gestation, with the greatest difference less than 37
weeks' gestation. The Figure illustrates the probability of re-
maining pregnant after 25 weeks' gestation for those women
with COVID-19 diagnosis, stratified into those with and with-
out symptoms. Using the log-rank test for trend of survivor
curves, we observed a significant downwards trend in the

compared with the group of women without COVID-19 diag-

nosis had limited risk for most outcomes, there was still an
association between the disease and preeclampsia (RR, 1.63;

ter, was markedly associated with a risk of the 3 summary in-

a All models adjusted for country, month entering study, maternal age, and
history of maternal morbidity (including diabetes, thyroid and other endocrine
disorders, cardiac disease, hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, kidney
disease, malaria, or tuberculosis).
Prepregnancy maternal morbidities included at least 1 of the following:
diabetes, thyroid and other endocrine disorders, cardiac disease,
hypertension, chronic respiratory disease, kidney disease, malaria,
or tuberculosis.
Having shortness of breath, chest pain, and cough with fe-
ver was associated with a substantial increase in the risk for
severe maternal and neonatal conditions and preterm birth.
However, it appears that a longer exposure to symptoms is
needed to see an associated increase in risk for preeclampsia,
eg, 5 to 10 days ofrespiratory symptoms (RR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.29-
4.58) (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Among those with no prepregnancy morbidities and those
without overweight at their first antenatal visit, women with
COVID-19 diagnosis were still at increased risk of these com-
plications compared with women without COVID-19 diagno-
sis. However, for maternal outcomes, those women with
COVID-19 diagnosis with prepregnancy morbidities had the
highest risk in the index pregnancy, suggesting that past mor-
bidities modify the effect of COVID-19 exposure, especially for
preeclampsia/eclampsia (RR, 3.29; 95% CI, 2.03-5.33) (Table 3).
Women who had overweight at the first antenatal visit and
subsequently were diagnosed with COVID-19 had the highest
risk for the maternal morbidity and mortality index (RR, 1.81;

SPMMI and preeclampsia/eclampsia (RR, 2.62; 95% Cl, 1.57-
4.36), suggesting that overweight status modifies the effect
of COVID-19 exposure (Table 3).
We also compared the risk for severe neonatal complica-
tions in test-positive and test-negative neonates of women with
and without COVID-19 diagnosis, the latter as a reference group.
The risks for the SNMI, SPMMI, and NICU stay 7 days or lon-
ger were higher in the test-negative neonates of women with
COVID-19 diagnosis. However, the test-positive neonates of

d SNMI includes at least 1 of the following morbidities: bronchopulmonary

women with COVID-19 diagnosis had considerably higher risk
for the SPMMI and, as expected, a large increased risk for a NICU
stay of 7 days or longer (Table 4).
In separate sensitivity analyses, adjusting for additional con-
founders (marital status, overweight, smoking and drug use
during pregnancy), restricting mothers with COVID-19 diagno-
sis to laboratory-confirmed positive results and excluding twins,
we found that relative risks for COVID-19-associated maternal
and neonatal morbidities were similar to our main results
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). Furthermore, we treated each
country (all hospitals in a country pooled) as if they were
separate studies in a meta-analysis. The pooled estimated RRs
(95% CI) were practically identical to the unadjusted and ad-
justed estimations, except for the SNMI, which was increased
from the unadjusted RR of 2.69 (95% Cl, 1.72-4.20) to 2.91
(95% CI, 1.76-4.74). As expected, considering the variability of
underlying populations and care systems, we identified some
heterogeneity of RR estimates across countries in the meta-
analysis for the maternal morbidity and mortality index
(12 = 50.0%; P = .02) and SPMMI (12 = 57.4%; P = .005), al-
though there was no systematic pattern among the countries.
Discussion
We conducted a large-scale, prospective, multinational study
to assess the symptoms and associations between COVID-19
in pregnancy and maternal and neonatal outcomes that in-
cluded, to our knowledge for the first time, immediately con-

comitant pregnant women without COVID-19 diagnosis from
the same populations, carefully enrolled to minimize selec-
tion bias.
We demonstrated that women with COVID-19 diagnosis,
compared with those without COVID-19 diagnosis, were at sub-
stantially increased risk of severe pregnancy complications,
including preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP syndrome, ICU ad-
mission or referral to higher level of care, and infections re-
quiring antibiotics, as well as preterm birth and low birth
weight. The risk of maternal mortality was 1.6%, ie, 22 times
higher in the group of women with COVID-19 diagnosis. These
deaths were concentrated in institutions from less developed
regions, implying that when comprehensive ICU services are
not fully available, COVID-19 in pregnancy can be lethal. Re-
assuringly, we also found that asymptomatic women with
COVID-19 diagnosis had similar outcomes to women without
COVID-19 diagnosis, except for preeclampsia.
Importantly, women with COVID-19 diagnosis, already at
high risk of preeclampsia and COVID-19 because of preexist-
ing overweight, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac and
chronic respiratory diseases,28 had almost 4 times greater risk
of developing preeclampsia/eclampsia, which could reflect the
known association with these comorbidities and/or the acute
kidney damage that can occur in patients with COVID-19.29
Our data support reports of an association between
COVID-19 and higher rates of preeclampsia/eclampsia/
HELLP syndrome,19'30 but it is still uncertain whether COVID-19
manifests in pregnancy with a preeclampsialike syndrome or
infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in an increased risk for pre-
eclampsia. Uncertainty persists because the placentas of
women with COVID-19, compared with controls, show vascu-
lar changes consistent with preeclampsia,31 but the state of
systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability found in non-
pregnant patients with severe illness and COVID-19 is also a
feature of preeclampsia."
It is known that in nonpregnant patients, distinct sub-
types may be predictive of clinical outcomes .33 We found the
presence of any COVID-19 symptoms was associated with in-
creased morbidity and mortality. Specifically, severe preg-
nancy and neonatal complication rates were highest in women
if fever and shortness of breath were present, reflecting sys-
temic disease; their presence for 1 to 4 days was associated with

severe maternal and neonatal complications. This observa-
tion should influence clinical care and referral strategies.
The risks of severe neonatal complications, including
NICU stay for 7 days or longer, as well as the summary index
of severe neonatal morbidity and its individual components,
were also substantially higher in the group of women with
COVID-19 diagnosis. The increased neonatal risk remained
after adjusting for previous preterm birth and preterm birth
in the index pregnancy; thus, a direct effect on the newborn
from COVID-19 is likely.
Overall, our results were consistent across morbidities and
mostly at an RR near or greater than 2 for maternal and neo-
natal outcomes, with narrow CIs excluding unity, and above 3
to 4 in several estimates. Sensitivity and stratified analyses con-
firmed the observed results. They are probably conservative
because overall, 41% of women with COVID-19 diagnosis were
asymptomatic, a subgroup with a low risk of complications.
Hence, higher morbidity and mortality risk should be ex-
pected for the general pregnant population, especially in low-
to middle-income countries.
We found 12.1% of neonates born to test-positive women
also tested positive, a higher figure than in a recent system-
atic review. 34 We speculate whether contamination at the time
of cesarean delivery was responsible because the rate in this
mother/neonate positive subgroup was 72.2%. Reassuringly,
as SARS-CoV-2 has not been isolated from breast milk,35 breast-
feeding was not associated with any increase in the rate oftest-
positive neonates.
Our results mostly reflect COVID-19 diagnosed in the third
trimester. Thus, women with COVID-19 diagnosis or whose
pregnancy ended earlier in pregnancy are underrepresented
either because our study was exclusively hospital based or ear-
lier infection may manifest with mild symptoms, which are
either ignored or managed in primary care. Alternatively, most
women might have avoided the hospital until late in preg-
nancy or when in labor. Clearly, the effect of COVID-19 early
in pregnancy needs urgently to be studied.
Limitations
Our study has expected limitations. Ideally, we would have
collected data prospectively from all pregnancies in the par-
ticipating institutions, but this was impractical because of

Conclusions
In this case-control study, mother smoking
during pregnancy was significantly associated
with ADHD in children. This is consistent
with other publication with cohort study
design. Additional efforts should be made to
improve the awareness of the increased risk
of ADHD in children associated with mother
smoking during pregnancy.
Instruction
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) is a chronic condition that affects
millions of children and often continues into
adulthood. ADHD includes a combination of
persistent problems, such as difficulty
sustaining attention, hyperactivity and
impulsive behavior. It is characterized by
problems paying attention, excessive activity,
or difficulty controlling behavior which is not
appropriate for a person's age.l These
symptoms begin by age six to twelve, are
present for more than six months, and cause
problems in at least two settings (such as
school, home, or recreational activities).2 In
children, problems paying attention may
result in poor school performance.3Although
it causes impairment, particularly in modern
society, many children with ADHD have a
good attention span for tasks they find
interesting.4
ADHD is one of the most common
neurobehavioral disorders of childhood.
About I in 10 children 4-17 years of age in
the United States have been diagnosed with
ADHD, based on parent reports. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is
working to understand the risk factors for
ADHD, including smoking during pregnancy,
so that more can be done to prevent the
disorder.

Prenatal maternal smoking has been
associated with ADHD in children in a
number of studies, but whether the
association is causal is still under debate. In
line with a number of observational studies,
smoking during pregnancy is associated with
the diagnosis of hyperkinetic disorder (HKD)5
as well as with sub-clinical symptoms of
inattention and hyperactivity. However, these
observational studies are vulnerable to genetic
confounding. Many of the studies relied on
retrospective reports of smoking and many
studies had small sample sizes, especially for
less common conditions such as TS and
schizophrenia. There are also many other
risks that are often present along with
maternal smoking that might explain the link
with neurobehavioral disorders. Thus, more
research studies are necessary to determine
how prenatal exposure to smoking is related
to developmental outcomes in children.
This study aimed to examine the association
between mother smoking during pregnancy
and ADHD in children using case-control
study design in national data collected by
CDC.
Method
NHANES National Youth Fitness Survey
(2012) was used in this study. The NHANES
National Youth Fitness Survey (NNYFS) was
conducted in 2012 to collect data on physical
activity and fitness levels in order to provide
an evaluation of the health and fitness of
children in the U.S. ages 3 to 15. The NNYFS
collected data on physical activity and fitness
levels of our youth through interviews and
fitness tests.
Children on common ADHD medications
were identified and formed the case group.
The most commonly used stimulant
medications include methylphenidate (Ritalin,
Concerta), mixed amphetamine salts

(Adderall), dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine),
and lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse). Non-
stimulant medications with a specific
indication for ADHD include atomoxetine
(Strattera), guanfacine (Intuniv). Each case
was matched to up to 5 controls based on sex,
age, race, and low birth weight (<5.5 lb). A
conditional logistic regression was conducted
among matched pairs to examine the impact
of mother smoking status during pregnancy
and ADHD.
This study employed a case-control study
design due the fact that ADHD could not be
commonly identified in this particular
database. We only had about 60 ADHD cases.
A case-control study is designed to help
determine if an exposure is associated with an
outcome (i.e., disease or condition of
interest). By definition, a case-control study
is always retrospective because it starts with
an outcome then traces back to investigate
exposures. When the subjects are enrolled in
their respective groups, the outcome of each
subject is already known by the investigator.
Case-control studies have specific advantages
compared to other study designs. They are
particularly appropriate for studying rare
diseases or outcomes. The practical value of
producing rapid results or investigating rare
outcomes may outweigh the limitations of
case-control studies. Because of their
efficiency, they may also be ideal for
preliminary investigation of a suspected risk
factor for a common condition; conclusions
may be used to justify a more costly and time-
consuming longitudinal study later.6
Conditional logistic regression is an extension
of logistic regression that allows to take into
account stratification and matching. Its main
field of application is observational studies
and in particular epidemiology. Odds ratios
(OR) from logistic regression, which is
exp(coefficient), is commonly used in the
medical literature as a measure of association
1518

between exposure and outcome. However, it
is relative risk that people more intuitively
understand as a measure of association.
Relative risk can be directly determined in a
cohort study by calculating a risk ratio (RR).
In case-control studies, and in cohort studies
in which the outcome occurs in less than 10%
of the unexposed population, the OR provides
a reasonable approximation of the RR.
However, when an outcome is common (i Y
10% in the unexposed group), the OR will
exaggerate the RR. 7
Results
A total of 60 ADHD cases were identified.
The average age was 10.7 years; 75.0% male,
63.3% white and 13.3% with low birth
weight. Only 57 cases were matched to a
total of 238 controls. Majority of cases had 5
controls (n=38), followed by 3 controls (n=6),
2 controls (n=5), I control (n=4) and 4
controls (n=4). For 57 cases, the average age
was 10.6 years old (sd=2.79), and it was 10.3
years old among 238 controls (sd=2.81).

According to the conditional logistic
regression, mother smoking during pregnancy
was associated with increased risk for ADHD
in children (Odds Ratio= 2.311, 95%
Confidence Interval: 1.108-4.824, p=0.026).
To be specific, the risk is 2.311 times higher
for a mother who was smoking during
pregnancy to have a kid with ADHD than a
month who was not. The true association
between the exposure and ADI--ID could not
be known, however 95% chances are it is
between 1.108 and 4.824.

In this case-control study, mother smoking
during pregnancy was significantly associated
with ADHD in children. This is consistent
with other publication with cohort study
design. The risk is 2.311 times higher for a
mother who was smoking during pregnancy
to have a kid with ADHD than a month who
was not. The true association between the
exposure and ADHD could not be known,
however, 95% chances are it is between 1.108
4.824.
The adjusted relative risk was 1.9 (95%
confidence interval: 1.3—2.8) in a nested case-
control study using data obtained from
Danish longitudinal registers including 170
children with hyperkinetic disorder and 3765
population-based control subjects.
Adjustment for parental age or exclusion of
children with low birth weight (<2500 g),
preterm delivery (<37 weeks completed
gestation), and Apgar scores < 7 at 5 minutes
revealed no changes in the results (Linnet KM
2005).In another study, Women who smoked
during pregnancy had a higher risk of getting
child with a high hyperactivity inattention
score than women who did not smoke during
pregnancy and the magnitude of the
associations was similar across cohorts with
very different smoking habits.8
There are many risks from smoking before
and during pregnancy, so it is especially
important that women do not smoke during
their reproductive years. CDC has gathered
many resources that healthcare providers can
use to help women quit smoking before or
during pregnancy and uses a public health
approach to eliminate tobacco use and
exposure during the reproductive years.
There are limitations of this study. This is a
case-control study and it has all the
limitations associated with this type of study
design, for example, selection bias. However
given the sample of the case group, this type
of study design is necessary. Secondly we

matched the cases and controls based on age,
gender, race, as well as birth weight,
however, some variables important might be
not controlled for, for example, the number of
cigarettes smoked because of data availability
issue.
In this case-control study we confirmed
mother smoking during pregnancy was
significantly associated with ADHD in
children. The magnitude of the associations
was similar with the findings in the literature.
Additional efforts should be made to improve
the awareness of the increased risk of ADHD
in children associated with mother smoking
during pregnancy.

Abstract—According to Pakistan Medical and Dental Council
(PMDC), Pakistan is facing a shortage of approximately 182,000
medical doctors. Due to the shortage of doctors; a large number
of lives are in danger especially pregnant woman. A large
number of pregnant women die every year due to pregnancy
complications, and usually the reason behind their death is that
the complications are not timely handled. In this paper, we
proposed ontology-based clinical decision support system that
diagnoses high-risk pregnant women and refer them to the
qualified medical doctors for timely treatment. The Ontology of
the proposed system is built automatically and enhanced
afterward using doctor's feedback. The proposed framework has
been tested on a large number of test cases; experimental results
are satisfactory and support the implementation of the solution.

INTRODUCTION
The world has a shortage of professional medical doctors;
even in the most developed countries have inadequate position
regarding the availability of medical doctors. According to
Association of American Medical Colleges, U.S is facing a
shortage of approximately 20,000 medical doctors [1]. In
Pakistan, the situation is even much worse. According to
Pakistan Medical and Dental Councils (PMDC), Pakistan is
facing a shortage of approximately 182,000 medical doctors
[2]. Because of this shortage, pregnant women are also affected
due to lack of proper and timely treatment, which increased the
mortality rate of pregnant women over the years. According to
world health organization (WHO), almost 500,000 women die
every year from pregnancy-related complications [3].
Especially focusing on Maternal Mortality Rate, it was
observed that most of the deaths occur because of few basic
complications. Moreover, these complications can be easily
treated once the reasons are diagnosed; therefore, the major
problem is the unavailability of proper diagnosis because of the
shortage of medical doctors.
The four high risk pregnancy complications handled in this
work are Hypertension, Obstructed Labor, Septicemia and
Hemorrhage. Increase in blood pressure during pregnancy

indicates Hypertension, Obstructed Labor is an anomaly that
may arise during the process of labor, Septicemia pollutes the
patient's blood and may occur due to infections caused by
bacteria and Hemorrhage occurs due to excessive loss of blood
from the patient's body.
To overcome this problem, we have proposed ontology-
based clinical decision support system which can partially
work in place of doctors to diagnose high-risk pregnant woman
and refer them to the qualified medical doctors for treatment.
This way, the high-risk patients will get proper treatment well
in time, and many lives can be saved. The main focus of this
system is to build a diagnostic procedure which can work
independently of qualified doctors and identify high risk
patients; Once these patients are identified, they can be treated
by medical doctors. So our system will help in reducing the
workload of doctors as well as providing basic health care to
more and more patients. The framework is composed of three
components: 1) Automatic Ontology Construction, 2)
Feedback System and 3) Ontology Enhancement Component.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2,
existing work in ontology based clinical decision support
system and automatic construction of ontology is discussed. In
section 3, the proposed approach is discussed. Experimental
results are presented in section 4. Finally, the conclusion is
drawn in section 5.
II. LITERATURE REVIEW
A. Ontology Based CDSS
There are many mistakes made on regular basis by humans
in clinical environments. Hazmy Iman Abas et al in [16] have
identified the three common mistakes made by clinicians that
are; they failed to meet guidelines, they are not educated on
regular basis and they are not aware of their responsibilities.
According to the authors, these mistakes can easily be avoided
by the use of ontology based clinical decision support system.
The early detection of Alzheimer Disease is a challenging task
in medical domain. Eider Sanchez et al in [17] proposed an
ontological CDSS approach to detect Alzheimer in early
stages. In this system multidisciplinary knowledge is used (i.e.
203 IP age
www.ijacsa.thesai.org


(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,
the system uses three ontologies that are SWAN, SNOMED
CT and MIND). SWAN is used for the diagnosis of Alzheimer
Disease, SNOMED CT's purpose is standardization and MIND
ontology is used to carry out patient tests. Farahidayah Bt.
Mahmud et al in [15] designed a CDSS that finds the right time
of weaning a patient from ventilator. According to the authors,
the proposed Ontology based CDSS is very helpful because of
the ontology's ability of presenting complex concepts,
reusability and specification of shared conceptualization.
Similarly, Adnan et al in [18] proposed ontology based
clinical decision support system to assist electronic
discharge summary (EDS) while prescribing the patient's
medications. Matt et al in [20] developed an ontology based
CDSS for preoperative risk assessment. The proposed system
takes the patient's data as input, stores it in database and also
passes it to Ontology Modeler for conversion into OWL format
(i.e. the same record is stored in two different formats).
Afterwards, inference is performed on both the database and
ontology. Rule engine is used on the database to calculate the
numeric scores (i.e. cardiac scores) whereas classification
algorithm is run on the ontology to assign category to the
patient, the results of both are then combined to calculate the
patient preoperative risk assessment.
B. Automatic Construction of Ontology
Abd-Elrahman Elsayed et al in [19] used data mining
technique (c4.5 decision tree) on structured data to construct
ontology automatically. In this approach, the authors proposed
decision tree to ontology mapping where the tree decision
nodes are mapped to ontology classes and leaf nodes are
mapped to individuals. The authors tested the proposed
approach on the soybean disease dataset and showed the
efficiency of the same. Seongwook Youn et al in [20] proposed
architecture for the classification of emails as spam or
legitimate using ontology based approach. The authors created
a dataset D based on the features of the email (i.e. spam email)
and used WEKA (J48 decision tree) to generate decision tree
which afterwards is passed to JENA for conversion into RDF
ontology format. Authors divided the original dataset into two
parts (i.e. training and testing dataset) and tested the proposed
approach on testing dataset; according to the authors the results
are satisfactory. Amit Bhagat et al [21] used association rule
mining to construct ontology from large transaction databases.
In the proposed approach, multiple level association rule
mining is used to extract more specific and relevant knowledge
as compared to single level rule mining. Patrick Clerkin et al in
[22] proposed automatic construction of ontology using the
COBWEB algorithm. COBWEB is a clustering algorithm
which creates different clusters of the data in a hierarchical
manner. In the proposed technique, the hierarchy of the clusters
given by COBWEB is mapped into ontology classes in such a
way that parent cluster(s) is mapped as parent or super class(es)
in the ontology whereas the sub or child cluster(s) is mapped as
sub-class(es) in the ontology. Henrihs Gorskis et al in [23]
reviewed 1) the work done in the field of ontology building
using data mining techniques and 2) the potential of different
techniques in the construction of ontology. According to the
authors, the ontologies created with data mining technique(s)
may be inferior to those constructed manually.

Ill. PROPOSED TECHNIQUE
In this paper, we have proposed a framework for predicting
high risk woman using ontology based CDSS. The framework
is composed of three main modules: 1) Automatic Ontology
Construction 2) Feedback System 3) Ontology Enhancing
Process.
A. Automatic Ontology Construction
This module automatically constructs the ontology of high
risk pregnant woman using pregnant woman dataset and is
composed of two sub-components namely Rules extractor and
Rules to Ontology Mapper. Rules extractor extracts the rules
from the pregnant woman dataset using WEKA and is
developed in Java. WEKA API is used to call WEKA
functions from the program. The dataset is given as input to
this component which uses WEKA API to extract rules from
the dataset. The dataset is given in the ARFF (Attribute-
Relation File Format) format which is compatible with WEKA.
ARFF format has two sections, the first section is Header
which contains the name of relation, the attributes of the
relation and the attributes' data types whereas the second
section has Data which contains the real instances of the
relations. Example of partial IRIS dataset in ARFF format is
given below.

Once the dataset is loaded, attribute selection algorithm is
called using WEKA API. We have used the genetic search for
attribute selection and once the most relevant features are
selected, JRIP algorithm is called to extract rules which later
are used for the construction of ontology as summarized in
figure 1.
Rules to Ontology Mapper is responsible to construct
ontology using the rules extracted in the first component as
shown in figure 2. It first creates ontology classes for each
dataset (i.e. hypertension, Obstructed labor, Hamorhage,
Septicemia) then the properties are created based on the
attributes found in the rules. Furthermore, the range and
domain of each property is set based on the information
provided by each dataset. Afterwards, for each class, its
definition is created that reflects the classification criteria for
that class.

B. Feedback System
Once a patient is predicted as high risk by our proposed
system and recommended to the doctor for treatment, feedback
is taken from the doctor whether the patient was correctly
identified or not. If the doctor overrules the decision made by
the system, the attributes which caused the decision are shown
to the doctor. He can add / delete the attribute(s) or tune their
parameters / range (i.e. change the values of an attribute to
more suitable one). Afterwards, the overruled instance with
tuned parameters or different attributes (if any) is added to
overruled dataset. Once the number of instances in overruled
dataset reaches (configurable), this dataset is passed as input
to Ontology Enhancing Process for updating the ontology. In
this way, doctor's knowledge is incorporated in the system and
ontology is enhanced accordingly as shown in figure 4.
C. Ontology Enhancing Process
According to Gruber [23], ontology represents knowledge
as a hierarchy of concepts and their relation for a specific
domain. Furthermore, ontology knowledge representation is
based on the concept of conceptualization which can be
defined as the objects, the concepts and the relationship that
hold among them [23]. New concepts, their properties and
relationship can easily be incorporated in ontology knowledge
base. Therefore, once the number of overruled instances
reaches p, JRIP algorithm is executed on overruled dataset to
extract new knowledge, and the same is updated in the
ontology either by creating new concepts or by defining new
relationship between the old concepts. The complete
architecture of our proposed Ontology based Clinical Decision
Support System for predicting high risk pregnant woman is
shown in figure 4.
lv. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A series of tests have been carried out in order to
demonstrate that the proposed system is working properly. The
tests have been subdivided in two classes: 1) Automatic
construction of ontology, and 2) Ontology enhancement
Process. Each of the experiment and its results are described in
following:
A. Automatic Construction of Ontology
This experiment is designed to verify the automatic
construction of ontology (i.e. how well the rules are mapped
into ontology). For this purpose, the ontology and existing rule-
base system are tested on the same datasets with the same
training and testing ratio. In this experiment, we used four
dataset (for each output class i.e. Hypertension, Obstructed
Labour, Hamorhage, Septicemia) where each dataset is divided
into two parts (i.e. 70% and 30%) where 70% of data is used
for training and 30% is used for testing. The experimentation
result showed that ontology and rule based system have same
accuracy which means the rules are transformed with 100%
accuracy into the ontology as shown in figure 5.
B. Ontology enhancement Process
Enhancing the ontology is the most important aspect and
has been deeply validated. In this activity, fifteen doctors from
five different hospitals of Pakistan participated, whenever the

patient is identified as high risk by our system, the patient is
referred to one of the fifteen doctors. If the doctor overruled the
decision, feedback from the doctor is taken and the instance is
added to overrule dataset (in this case the ß value is 25). When
the instances in the overruled dataset reach p, the new
vol. 6, No. 12, 2015
knowledge is incorporated in the ontology. We have observed
that after two rounds of ontology updation the accuracy of the
system increases and the false positives are decreased
significantly as shown in figure 6.

V. CONCLUSION
According to world health organization (WHO), almost
500,000 women die every year from pregnancy-related
complications. Moreover, these complications can be easily
treated once diagnosed; however, the major problem is
unavailability of proper diagnosis because of shortage of
medical doctors. In this paper, we have proposed an ontology-
based CDSS for diagnose high-risk pregnant woman and refer
them to the qualified medical doctors for treatment. The

proposed framework is tested on a large number of test cases,
results are satisfactory and support the implementation of the
same. The work can be extended in many directions; one
possible direction is including more pregnancy-related disease
in the ontology. Second direction is automatic ontology
enhancement process, currently based on expert (doctor)
feedback the ontology is enhanced, machine learning
algorithms should be incorporated in the proposed system to
enhance ontology automatically.

ABSTRACT
A qualified health workforce is essential to receiving effective, timely, affordable, equitable and respectful family
planning and comprehensive abortion care. However, in many countries, health workers lack the competencies
required to deliver quality family planning and comprehensive abortion care services. Competency-based edu-
cation and learning aims to train and assess competencies. The theory-supported approach focuses on outcomes,
emphasizes the learner's ability to perform, promotes learner-centeredness and links the health needs of the
Primary health care workforce
population to the competencies required of health workers. In 2011, the World Health Organization published a
guidance document, Sexual and reproductive health - Core competencies in primary care, defining the competencies
that primary care providers need to safely deliver sexual and reproductive health services at the community level
and included family planning and comprehensive abortion care.
In this article, we describe the methodology and process undertaken in 2020, by the World Health Organi-
zation to produce the family planning and comprehensive abortion care competencies guidance, filling gaps
identified in the previous guidance document. The World Health Organization's Family Planning and Compre-
hensive Abortion Care toolkit for the primary health care workforce was published in 2022 and defines the key
competencies for health workers in primary health care providing quality family planning and comprehensive
abortion care services, as well as support for developing programmes and curricula for education and lifelong
learning. The Toolkit is useful for practitioners, managers/supervisors and employers, educators, regulatory
bodies, and policymakers. It is an important advance toward strengthening family planning and comprehensive
abortion care services in primary health care.
Background
Competent health workers are essential to effective, timely, afford-
able, equitable, respectful, and universal health care (UHC) [1]. How-
ever, all countries, to varying degrees, face challenges in the education,
retention, and performance of their health workforce
In recent
years, within a context of increased health system complexity and
interdependency, the competency-based approach to education and
learning has been widely adopted for health professions at all levels.
Competency-based education (CBE) facilitates the alignment of ability
and performance within and across health systems globally. CBE can be
adopted for instruction, preparation, and assessment [3]. In contrast to
traditional input-based education approaches, whereby learning is
achieved through exposure to certain health- and medicine-related
content or curriculum for a specific amount of time, CBE focuses on
achieving the desired outcomes
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines competencies as:
the abilities of a person to integrate knowledge, skills, and attitudes in
their performance of tasks in a given context. Competencies are durable,
trainable, and, through the expression of behaviors, measurable"
[1]
Competencies provide benchmarks, not just for education but also for
performance in the workplace. They help to define standards of

performance, but also to plan and measure professional development,
improving job performance as well as learning
CBE strategy aims to
develop a person's abilities and concentrates on the goals and outcomes
of learning, rather than prescribing a particular learning path with a set
of pre-defined milestones
In CBE systems, learning is based on the
acquisition of competency-based learning outcomes that are objective,
standardized, and can be observed in practice, and transferred and
translated across contexts
. This approach to health care edu-
[3,6-10]
cation has been implemented and adopted into policy internationally
Regulatory bodies have a fundamental commitment to sup-
[11,12].
porting professional competence and therefore play a critical role in
promoting the implementation of CBE for health care
[13].
The knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors of health care pro-
fessionals influence the quality and outcomes of services delivered,
including in family planning (FP) and comprehensive abortion care
For example, there is a significant relationship between
(CAC) [14,15]
the uptake and continuation of FP and the skill of health professionals
offering counselling and services
Further, estimates from 2017
[14].
suggest that just under half of all abortions that occurred globally from
2010 to 2014 were unsafe, indicating that services were either carried
out by a trained provider using outdated methods; a safe method was
used without appropriate support from a trained provider; or the service
was provided by an untrained person using dangerous, invasive methods
[15].
Despite this, the inclusion of FP and CAC within Sexual and Repro-
ductive Health (SRH) core competencies or curricula for education and
training is inconsistent across professional bodies, creating a gap in the
competencies and standard of care necessary to meet the SRH needs of
populations
In 2011, WHO published a guidance document,
[16,17].
Sexual and Reproductive Health - Core Competencies in Primary Health
Care, defining the competencies, including knowledge, skills, attitudes,
and behaviors that primary care providers need to safely deliver SRH
services at the community level, including FP and CAC. However, in
2020, during efforts to update the document, it emerged that it con-
tained gaps and had not been widely adopted
[18, 19].
To set the standard of performance for FP and CAC service providers,
and as part of a unique collaboration across UNDP-UNFPA-UNICEF-
WHO-World Bank Special Programme of Research, Development and
Research Training in Human Reproduction (HRP) and the Department of
Health Workforce, a competency development team was organized to
prepare the Family Planning and Comprehensive Abortion Care Toolkit for
the primary health care workforce
[19-21].
The Toolkit, as of today, consists of two volumes: the FP and CAC
competencies are in Volume 1, and Volume 2 provides guidance on how
to develop competency-based education programs and curricula
The FP and CAC competencies (Volume 1) are designed to
[20,21].
accommodate a range of health care workers, contexts, service delivery
mechanisms and evolving competency requirements. The FP and CAC
Toolkit was intended as a foundational tool that can be adapted by ed-
ucators and regulators for current and future health practice and focus
on the core functions of primary health care providers toward universal
health care, whoever is providing them. In this article, we describe the
methodology and process undertaken by the competency development
team to develop the FP and CAC competencies published in Volume 1 of
the Toolkit to both advocate for the use of these core competencies in
health care education, learning and continuing professional develop-
ment, and to encourage the development of competencies for other areas
of practice.
Development and validation of FP and CAC core competencies
There is not one universally accepted model or guidance for the
development of core competencies for health care professions
[22],
• or-
ganizations have used a range of processes and methods. WHO under-
took the development of the FP and CAC competencies in a series of
phases. The first phase consisted of a review of key literature; the second

phase involved focus group discussions (FGDs); the third phase devel-
oped the competencies; the draft competencies were refined and vali-
dated in phase four, an on-line global DELPHI consultation
[23]
to
achieve consensus; and the final phase was a virtual "Town Hall"-style
meeting to confirm the competencies and gauge their global acceptance.
The phases brought together different sources of data to develop and
validate the competencies. We discuss each phase in turn below.
Phase 1: Literature review
The competency development team conducted a review of existing
literature on SRH competencies to inform the structure and content of
the FP and CAC competencies
The specific objectives of the liter-
[24].
ature review were to: 1) collect evidence from published and unpub-
lished documents to identify how the 2011 WHO SRH competencies
framework had been used, 2) examine what aspects of the document has
been useful and which ones had not; and 3) identify any additional
domains and competencies to be included in the FP and CAC
competencies.
The competency development team used the following terms to
locate published and unpublished literature for review: "competencies",
"competency frameworks", "competency-based education", "SRH ser-
vices", "family planning", and "comprehensive abortion care". They
used these terms to search websites of international health organizations
and professional associations for relevant documents. The team
analyzed and reviewed documents to determine whether they had value
based on the objectives of the review and credibility as sources using
specifically designed templates until they achieved saturation.
In total, the team purposively selected and reviewed 69 documents
(including articles and reports) published from 2010 until October 2020.
The findings of the literature review were summarized into tables.

tional competencies that could be added to the revised framework.
Overall, the findings of the literature review suggested that the FP
and CAC competencies would benefit from an increased focus on ado-
lescents and population groups in vulnerable settings, the addition of
post-abortion care and postpartum family planning, among others,
improved flexibility (or associated strategies/tools) in adapting the
competencies to various contexts (e.g., humanitarian settings) and
occupational groups (e.g., due to health workforce optimization), and
include advice on how to implement at the country-level. The review
also indicated that the FP and CAC competencies should place greater
emphasis on addressing provider bias, values clarification, managing
care in restrictive environments (religion, laws, community norms), and
the use of data for decision making. The review findings further sug-
gested that, structurally, the FP and CAC competencies should avoid
overlap between the competencies and domains provide additional
detail, be more user-friendly
and take a lifespan approach. Finally,
[62],
according to the review, the updated document should list essential
competencies and encourage countries to add their own content and
competencies. These results informed the content and structure of the FP
and CAC domains and competencies included in the Toolkit (Volume 1).

The team conducted FGDs to 1) explore stakeholder perceptions and
use of the 2011 WHO Sexual and reproductive health: Core competencies in
primary care document and 2) understand stakeholder needs for FP and
CAC competencies. The FGDs were designed to complement and address
any gaps in information identified by the literature review. The team
invited 22 faculty, policymakers, practitioners, trainers, and members of
relevant professional organizations to participate in two virtual FGDs in
November 2020. Of these 22 individuals, thirteen attended the first FGD
and 17 participated in the second. The FGDs aimed to explore: 1) What
are the current challenges in the delivery of FP and CAC services? 2)
Were you aware of the 2011 WHO Sexual and reproductive health: Core
competencies inprimary care? and 3) What recommendations do you have
for the FP and CAC competencies?
The analysis of the FGDs took a phenomenological study approach
The team identified and categorized themes within and across
[74].
interview data to describe the phenomena of interest. The team
discovered that most of the participants were familiar with the 2011
WHO SRH framework. Of these, some mentioned that the 2011 WHO
SRH framework had not influenced practice and needed to be updated in
line with recent evidence from WHO guidelines for FP and CAC. Others
described the framework as lacking contextualization and including
excessive information that was not easy to interpret, thereby limiting its
practical use. Participants explained that the framework lacked infor-
mation on health workforce optimization, tools for actual implementa-
tion and monitoring, and details on how to perform procedures.
Furthermore, they argued that it was also missing the social component.
Challenging issues, such as working with minors, maintaining confi-
dentiality, operating within restrictive laws, providing services during
pandemics and in humanitarian settings required further elaboration.
Guidance on training faculty members and addressing care in terms of
human rights also needed additional explanation.
FGD participants described several obstacles to the delivery of FP
and CAC, including misconceptions and stigma among providers; reli-
gious and legal restrictions affecting service provision; provider bias; the
relationship between adequate theoretical knowledge and effective
practice or competency; and the lack of access to services among people
in vulnerable settings. Participants identified issues with formal edu-
cation program, such as inconsistency between pre-service training and
service provision; inadequately prepared faculty members providing
poor quality education; lack of procedural and national guideline
training; missing and/or outdated equipment at facilities; and poorly
selected clinical learning sites. Management issues included having an
inadequate number of trained staff; managers lacking authority to share
3


U.R. Loi et al.
tasks between different occupations; and inadequate supervision. Par-
ticipants also felt there was lack of coordination between government
and other organizations, the private sector, and development partners.
The participants made recommendations for the new FP and CAC
competencies. For example, they suggested that FP and CAC compe-
tencies should include content on the development of communication
skills; recording, interpreting, and practical use of data; inclusion of
post-pregnancy FP and CAC in pre-service education programs; self-care
and health promotion; and increased time for hands-on skill acquisition.
The participants felt that faculty members needed to be updated on SRH
service provision. They added that professional development and on-
the-job trainings are important mechanisms to be included to maintain
the competence of faculty. Other recommendations included: the use of
competencies in actual practice; to simplify and make it more user
friendly; guidance on how to use the competencies in different contexts;
the provision of incentives and other opportunities to encourage use of
the competencies. Finally, there was a request for a dissemination and
implementation strategy to be articulated at national level with all
stakeholders engaged in the process.
Phase 3: Constructing the competency document
The results of the literature review and the FDGs formed the basis of
the initial draft of the FP and CAC competencies. The team additionally
ensured that the competencies were aligned with the new WHO Abor-
tion Care guideline
They retained Domain A from the 2011 SRH
[75].
Competency Framework which listed 11 necessary "attitudes and
values" for providing high-quality SRH care
). For the

"professional domains", the team created six overarching areas from B to
G, which apply to all areas of health and are required for performance of
ATTITUDES

the technical competencies. These domains included: client-
centeredness, decision-making,
collaboration,
communication,
evidence-informed practice, and personal conduct. Each competency
specifies the knowledge and the behaviors required (Fig. 1). Finally, the
draft FP and CAC competencies included three "practice domains" H to
J, respectively: shared FP and CAC competencies, FP competencies, and
CAC competencies. The practice competencies are specific, but not
exclusive, to FP and CAC and distinguish FP and CAC practitioners from
other health care workers. The competencies were designed to be suit-
able for defining learning outcomes (or learning objectives) - both for
formal education, and for non-formal and informal learning.

The Delphi Consultation process was conducted from September to
November 2021 to achieve consensus on the content of the draft FP and

ducted two rounds of virtual Delphi consultations to gather feedback,
gauge agreement with the content of the draft FP and CAC competencies
and receive suggestions for improvement and additional content. They
recruited potential participants by sharing an invitation to FP and CAC
practitioners and educators globally. A wide variety of relevant orga-
nizations also nominated potential participants and an invitation was
also distributed through the Implementing Best Practice (IBP) Network
members
. Potential participants were invited to nominate other
[78]
experts and practitioners in a 'snowball' recruitment process using
Survey Monkey. The invitation included a short video explaining how
important and valuable their expertise would be to the process to
encourage them to join the consultation.

panelists who expressed interest in participating, 108 fully completed
the consultation and a further 33 partially completed it. Among the 108
participants, about half held master's degrees and another third had
achieved a doctorate. Most participants were either physicians (31 %) or
midwives (29 %) (
Fig. 2)
The competency development team developed the questions for the
Delphi consultation based upon the findings of the literature review and
previous similar surveys
They provided a 5-point Likert
scale (strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree,
strongly disagree) to indicate panelists' level of agreement with com-
petency statements. The competencies were available in English, French
and Spanish. The team used the software platform, Welphi (https://
www.welphi.com/en/) which permitted respondents to complete the
questions anonymously at their own pace and provided spaces for
additional comments. The team took note of feedback during the
consultation and the areas of disagreement and later modified the FP
and CAC competencies accordingly. They then explored the nature and
characteristics of panelists with divergent views to identify whether
these represented a particular aspect of global diversity that had not
been adequately reflected, and to rectify any gaps, errors or areas that
could be better presented
[76,77]
As part of our analysis of the first round of the Delphi consultation,
the team assessed the characteristics of the expert panelists to ensure
that they were globally representative. They then analyzed the feedback
and made improvements to the competencies, such as simplifying,
clarifying, and removing duplications. Two members of the competency
development team reviewed the opinions of expert panelists who rated
the competencies the lowest to identify inconsistent negative responses
and to explore whether there were any groups sharing socio-
demographic characteristics (such as geography, context, occupation)
who disagreed with the competencies. No specific patterns emerged. All
the comments associated with a particular competency were considered
and discussed with two team members until they agreed upon the
necessary changes. Where necessary the team revised the competency,
and the new version was consulted again with the panelists in Round 2
of the Delphi study. Twelve competencies were rephrased as a result and
sent for further feedback. Only panelists who had participated in Round
1 were invited to participate in Round 2, to ensure continuity and
comparability of responses, and so that responses were based on the
detailed understanding of the competencies. In total, 77 panelists
completed Round 2, and a further 10 partially completed Round 2.
According to Delphi methodology, a 70 % consensus among partic-
ipants is considered acceptable and in accordance with Delphi study
methodology
In the first round the Delphi achieved higher
[76, 77].
consensus at greater than 90 % on each of the competencies. Within the
Delphi methodology, amendment can end once a high level of consensus
has been achieved. Nevertheless, the feedback had led to some suggested
changes, and the team advanced these to the second round. The
consensus rate in the second round was higher than in the first (ranging
from 91 % to 96 %). Therefore, the original plan for a third round was
deemed unnecessary.
Phase 5: Third-tier corroboration — Town Hall meeting
Validation of the FP and CAC competencies took place in a 2-hour
virtual Town Hall meeting on 9 December 2021. The meeting was
chaired by HRP and included 88 registered participants, including FP
and CAC practitioners, national and international FP and CAC interest
groups, teachers and lecturers, technical advisors/officers and project
managers, pharmacists, and researchers. The meeting was co-hosted by
the WHO Prevention of Unsafe Abortion Unit and the WHO Contra-
ception and Fertility Care Unit.
Prior to the Town Hall meeting, the competency development team
provided relevant documents to participants in English; French and
Spanish versions of the competencies document were available upon
request. Following the presentation of the draft competencies, partici-
pants discussed and submitted comments and questions through the
online chat facility. A full set of questions with responses and proposed
Sexual & Reproductive Healthcare 39 (2024) 100945
changes to the competencies were collated after the virtual meeting and
shared with participants (
Fig. 3)
The final version of the FP and CAC competencies resulting from the
collaborative and consultative process included 57 FP and CAC com-
petencies, which are organized into ten domains. The ten domains fall
into three competency groups: 1) attitudes, 2) professional compe-
tencies and 3) practice competencies.

include a flexible menu for ease of use. This menu also facilitates
contextualized adjustments to the local policy, regulatory and health
systems' contexts.
Based on feedback during the Town Hall meeting, the competencies
include reference to human rights standards in international law, the
applicability of which in a specific setting will depend on factors such as
the State's ratification of relevant human rights instruments.
Discussion
The Toolkit was developed with the ambition to strengthen FP and
CAC education and training with competency-based performance
assessment. The collaborative and consultative methodology under-
taken to develop the FP and CAC competencies resulted in evidence-
based competencies that allow for standardization and adaptability
across contexts. By articulating critical competencies for FP and CAC,
this Toolkit sets a global benchmark that encourages and supports health
workers and decision-makers around the world to strive towards
harmonized high standards of services. These competencies, which are
based on recent evidence and guidelines including the 2022 WHO
Abortion Care guideline
will help set standards for education,
[75],
training, and performance.
Attitudes, or feelings, values, and beliefs, are foundational to all
other competencies, and influence their behavior and the performance
of all tasks undertaken in the health care context. Stigmatizing attitudes
among health workers and others involved in the delivery of FP and CAC
hinders access to quality care and is a fundamental cause of health in-
equalities
. The FP and CAC competencies provide a shared
[80-82]
language about attitudes, knowledge and skills needed in service de-
livery. The inclusion of attitudes as a fundamental competency for FP
and CAC is progress towards the reduction of stigma and normalization
of these services.
In the development of the FP and CAC competencies, the competency
development team adhered to a stepwise consultative process, previ-
ously used by many professional organizations, to assure maximum
input from diverse sources (professional areas of practice, countries and
regions, socio-economic and cultural contexts). The process undertaken
was rigorous and demonstrated strong consensus among a wide range of
stakeholders. However, there were some limitations to this process.
Although the competency development team made efforts to be inclu-
sive, they may have overlooked key stakeholders and experts. In the
consultative process, the team provided the draft competencies in three
languages and encouraged comments in the language participants felt
most comfortable using. As a result, the team received comments in
French, Spanish and Greek. Nevertheless, most of the consultation ac-
tivities were in English. This may have biased participation away from
non-English speaking groups.
The process we undertook to create and validate the FP and CAC
competencies was effective and offers a further model for the develop-
ment of CBE tools. We encourage the formation of non-formal trans-
national networks, such as the one created for the development of these
FP and CAC competencies to share experiences, tools, applications, and
feedback toward the uptake and continued improvement of the com-
petencies and the Toolkit.
Accelerating awareness, uptake and use of the FP and CAC compe-
tencies is of prime importance to improve performance of the primary
health workforce. Most stakeholders are aware of the value of using

What were the consultation procedures leading to the development of the Competencies
document?
A request for more information on micro credentials and informal elements of learning (the 70-20-
10 model).
Questions and suggestions on how to disseminate and make the competencies work for any context.
How to make discussion about FP and CAC provision safe on social media (especially when those
communicators remove content from their platforms)?
How can we strengthen national ownership and accountability for implementation. Because the
document is a guide, so WHO Member States are not obliged to adopt them? There is urgency to
implement, so I have a suggestion for: a resolution signed and adopted by regions and countries.
How to use the competencies in those countries which have restrictive laws on abortion, or forbid it
completely?
Suggestion to use digital platforms to support dissemination, which can be very effective channels
for the dissemination and implementation and involvement of Professional Associations in country.
The need for advocacy to engage in promotion of those documents and also to lobby the social
media platforms not to block vital and research-based information.
What is your opinion of simulation within training?
10. How to tackle illegal and dangerous informal provision of CAC services?
11. Discussion on use of the phrase " the fullest extent of the law" in respect of clarity but also restrictive
nature of that phrase that doesn't take into account the international human rights standards that
the state is legally obligated to implement and health professional needs to take into account,
sometimes forgetting their own private beliefs.

competencies to improve education, learning and practice in the health
sector.
The FP and CAC competencies provide a menu of options, from
which organizations, institutions and service providers can choose the
set of individual competencies they require to focus on. They may
identify a tailored set of competencies aligned with national or local-
level health requirements and capacity gaps in the workforce. Specific
language of the FP and CAC competencies can be adapted to local
contexts.
Conclusion
Healthcare technology and systems are in constant flux and are
advancing rapidly. Continued validation of professional competencies
and standards is essential to accommodate this ever-changing environ-
ment. A single method for competency development and validation is
unlikely to satisfy the needs of all situations. However, the effective
processes and methods used here may provide guidance for others
interested in developing competencies and standards in SRH and
elsewhere.

ABSTRACT
Objectives. Different sources of
prenatal care data were used to exam-
ine the association between birth out-
comes of HIV-infected women and the
Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization
(APNCU) index.
Methods. Adjusted odds ratios of
birth outcomes for 1858 HIV-positive
mothers were calculated for APNCU
indexes on the basis of birth certificate
data or 3 types of physician visits on
Medicaid claims.
Results. Claims- and birth certifi-
cate—based APNCU indexes agreed
poorly (K < 0.3). Only the broadest
claims-based APNCU index had lower
adjusted odds ratios for low birth-
weight (0.64; 95% confidence interval
[CI]=O.49, 0.84) and preterm birth
(0.70; 95% Cl=o.54, 0.91). The birth
certificate—based index had a reduced
adjusted odds ratio (0.73; 95% CI=
0.56, 0.95) only for preterm bilth.
Conclusions. The association of
birth outcomes and adequacy of prena-
tal care in this HIV-infected cohort dif-
fered significantly depending on the
source of prenatal care data. (Am J Pub-

The impact of prenatal care on birth out-
comes has been an area of subqantialSontro-
versy in the public health qeld. I A number of
indexes, notably KotelchuÖk's Adequacy of-
Prenatal Care Utilization (APNCU)
have been developed to study this issue.
Less attention, however, has been directed to
evaluating the type of data used to calculate
measures of the use of prenatal care.
Although vital statistics data are often
used as a sc%rce of information on prenatal
7 5-7 /
care, birth certificate records reflect the
Q!ber's recollection of her prenatal care his-
tory and her understanding of what consti-
tutes a prenatal care visit. Administrative data
provide an alternative source of such infor-
mation. These data offer the advantages of
eliminating patient recall as a potential
source of error and permitting specification
of the types of providers who deliver prenatal
care. Care from diverse types of primary and
specialty providers during pregnancy may
have distinct benefits for women with chroTfi
diseases such as HIV infection, who ave
8
increased risk of adverse birth outco es.
In this retrospective cohort stu y, we
computed APNCU indexes from birth certifi-
cate data and Medicaid claims for a cohort of
HIV-infected pregnant women. For the
claims-derived assessment, we computed
APNCU indexes for 3 progressively broad
definitions ofthe types of providers who con-
tribute to prenatal care. We hypothesized that

preterm birth.
Methods
Data
We studied 1858 Medicaid recipients in
New York State who delivered live-born sin-
gleton children between 1993 and 1995, who
were identified by a tested case-finding
screen as HIV infected, and who had claims
data linked to vital statistics records (92% of
mothers). For mothers with multiple deliver-
ies in the study period, one delivery was ran-
domly selected. The study population also
reflects the prior exclusion of 14 mothers
who participated in programs that paid a
global fee for prenatal care, since we could
not determine the number or type of their
visits.
Birth outcomes served as the criteria for
our analyses. Low birthweight was specified
as less than 2500 g, and preterm birth was
defined as a gestational age of less than
37 weeks, based on the physician's esti-
mate or, when the physician's estimate was
unavailable (3.7% of cases), the mother's esti-
mate of her last menses.
The APNCU index was calculated in
4 ways. First, we used data on prenatal care
visits from vital statistics records. Then we
determined the number and timing of visits
from Medicaid claims for (l) obstetrics-
gynecology visits only; (2) obstetrics-
gynecology, family practice, or general
medicine services; and (3) obstetrics-gyne-

cology, any primary care, and HIV-related
specialty care (HIV-related specialties
include infectious disease, allergy/immunol-
ogy, hematology, and oncology). To simplify
the analysis, inadequate prenatal care was
compared with all other levels (i.e., ade-
quate plus, adequate, and intermediate)
combined.
To control for possible confounders, we
included several other maternal characteris-
tics in our multivariate analyses. Lacking
viral load and CD4 T-lymphocyte data, we
evaluated maternal HIV stage from diag-
noses previously reported to be predictive of
maternal—child HIV transmissio , including
history of clinical 'DS,- pne monia, or
anemia during pregnancy. _Chronic medical
conditions including hypertension, asthma,
and diabetes were also determined from
diagnoses on claims. Illicit drug use was
measured by an approach that, in previous
validation studies of claims data, identified
85% of SLf6jec)with illicit drug use noted
on charts 10 Other demographic and behav-
ioral covariates included age, race/ethnicity,
marital status, nativity (US, including Puerto
Rican, vs foreign), New York City resi-
dence, parity, year of delivery, educational
attainment, and smoking and alcohol use
during pregnancy.
Analysis
Simple K computed
to assess the chance-corrected agreement
among the different measures of adequate
prenatal care. These are interpreted in the
same way as intraclass correlation coeffi-
cients. To evaluate the relative strength of the
association between the variously specified
APNCU indexes and birth outcomes, we
compared 4 logistic regression models for
each outcome. Each model included the
same covariates with I of the 4 APNCU
indexes (there were no significant interaction
terms), and the adjusted odds ratio and 95%
confidence interval were contrasted.
Results
In 17% of the deliveries, the infants
were low-birthweight; a similar proportion
were preterm. The proportion of mothers
with adequate prenatal care utilization var-
ied from one half for the APNCU index
derived from vital statistics to two thirds for
the index based on visits to the most com-
prehensive set of providers (Table 1). As
shown by the K statistic, we observed poor
agreement between each of the 3 claims-
based APNCU indexes of prenatal care and
the birth certificate—based APNCU index.
Agreement among the claims-based mea-
sures was considerably better.
The adjusted odds ratios for the 4 types
of data source did not differ dramatically for
either birth outcome (Table 2). However, the
APNCU measure based on visits to the most
comprehensive set of providers—primary
care, obstetrics-gynecology, and HIV special-
ists—consistently showed the strongest asso-
ciation, with a 30% to 35% reduction in the
adjusted odds of either birth outcome. The
other indexes showed 15% to 20% reduc-
tions in the odds of low birthweight. How-
ever, the birth certificate—derived measure
showed a 25% reduction in the adjusted odds

ell ering obstetric and
gynecologic ser es. n considering visits
to other providers, such as internists and HIV
specialists, in a measure of adequacy of pre-
natal care, we may have classified some
women as having adequate prenatal care
when they actually had fewer obstetric visits
than recommended. However, we hypothe-
size that visits to these other providers facili-
tated detection and treatment of conditions
that could have had an adverse effect on birth
outcomes (e.g., serious infections, hyperten-
sion, severe anemia, asthma, or poor nutri-
tion). We cannot say whether a study of
healthy women or women with diseases other
than HIV infection would show a similar
advantage to considering care during preg-
nancy delivered by providers other than
obstetricians.

Our findings should prompt researchers
to consider the value of administrative data
in the examination of prenatal care adequacy.
They should also lead researchers to recon-
sider the Wpes of visits that should be included
in an evaluation of prenatal care utilization
or, more accurately, an evaluation of care
during pregnancy. For women with chronic
diseases, treatment from a broader set of
providers may contribute to improved birth
outcomes. Z)

ABSTRACT
Objectives. This study sought to
identify characteristics of high-risk
pregnant women that predicted long-
term participation in a home visitation
program.
Methods. Data regarding sociode-
mographic characteristics, perceived
needs, psychological functioning, sub-
stance use, and informal social support
were collected prospectively from 152
short-term and 221 long-term program
participants.
Results. In comparison with short-
term participants, long-term partici-
pants were more likely to have been
African American, married, nonsmok-
ers, and enrolled in the program during
their second trimester of pregnancy,
and they were more likely to have had
emotional and instrumental support
needs.
Conclusions. Women with greater
social support needs and healthier behav-
iors were more receptive to long-term
home visitation than other women. (Am J

Past studies of maternal home visitation
programs have feported attr)tion rates rang-
ing from 5% to 60%.1-4 Although the primary
goal of most honie visitation studies is to
measure programmatic effects on infant mor-
bidity and mortality, investigators often face
difficulties estimating program benefits
when a substantial proportion of women drop
out earlier than expected.
To date, relatively few studies have
focused on examining the characteristics of
women who diol)PL1t of prevention programs
prematurely.5YNone of these studies have
focused on pregnant women at risk for poor
psychosocial functioning, and none are spe-
cific to maternal home visitation programs.
Given the dearth of information concerning
the characteristics of program dropouts and
completers and the applicability of this
knowledge to program planning, the present
study examined associations between
women's sociodemographic characteristics,
perceived needs, psychological functioning,
substance use, and informal social support
networks and their duration of participation
in a North Carolina matemal home visitation
program.
Methods
Study Design and Sample
This study was part of a comprehensive
evaluation of the North. Cäölina Maternal
Outreac • Wdrk&, As described
14 /
elsewhe quasi-experimental design
was used to select 373 women who were
enrolled in the program and met the follow-
ing criteria: (l) receipt of maternity care
coordination services, (2) less than 28 weeks
pregnant, and (3) presence of at least one of
several risk factors (i.e., noncompliance in
regard to care, previous poor birth outcome,
adolescent pregnancy, transportation diffi-
culties, inadequate social support, high med-
ical risk, physical abuse, substance abuse,
mental illness, lack of housing, or other
stressful family situations).
Study subjects were classified as short-
term participants if they dropped out of the
program before 10 months after delivery
(n = 152). They were classified as long-term
participants if they remained in the program
for at least 10 months after delivery
(n = 221).

1. INTRODUCTION
Malaria remains a persistent and life-threatening
disease, annually affecting millions and
significantly impacting mortality rates, particularly
among children under five and pregnant women,
contributing to nearly 30% of recorded deaths in
hospitals and health centers [1]. The global
significance of malaria persists, notably in
endemic countries such as Nigeria, where 588
million people are at risk [2]. Caused by five
Plasmodium species,
with
Plasmodium
falciparum being the most lethal, malaria
continues to pose a significant public health
challenge, prevalent in numerous African
countries [2]. Recent findings underscore Nigeria
and the Democratic Republic of the Congo's
substantial contribution, accounting for over 40%
of the estimated total deaths due to malaria [2].
Globally, malaria remains a devastating
international health concern, with nearly 600
million new infections and 3 million deaths
reported annually. The impact is particularly
severe among children under five and pregnant
women in sub-Saharan Africa, where almost
30% of the annual mortality in this population is
attributed to malaria [1].
Pregnant women residing in malaria-endemic
regions pose a significant concern due to their
reduced immunity during pregnancy. Moreover,
in areas characterized by stable malaria
transmission, a substantial number of malaria
cases during pregnancy exhibit no symptoms [3].
The absence of symptoms in pregnant women is
attributed to acquired immunity from previous
exposures to malarial infections [4].
Regrettably, malaria poses a dual threat to both
the expectant mother and the developing fetus.
Various regions in Nigeria have reported
divergent prevalence rates of malaria in
pregnancy, ranging from 19.7% to 72.0% [5].
Malaria can lead to adverse maternal outcomes
such as anemia, hypoglycemia, and, in severe
cases, maternal death. Sub-Saharan Africa alone
witnesses an estimated 10,000 maternal deaths
annually due to malaria-related anemia [6].
Furthermore, malaria significantly contributes to
low birth weight in infants due to compromised
nutrient delivery to the placenta [7].
Malaria holds the top position among the seven
diseases initially targeted for global control or
eradication by the World Health Organization's
Tropical Disease Research (TDR) [8]. This
prioritization is due to the disease's significant
morbidity, mortality rates, diagnostic challenges,
the absence of ideal drugs and effective
vaccines, and other behaviors exhibited by its
vector.
The impact of malaria extends beyond individual
health, adversely affecting the physical, mental,
and social well-being of communities, along with
impeding the economic development of nations.
Studies reveal that households spend up to one
thousand, one hundred and twelve naira monthly
on malaria treatment, presenting a considerable
financial burden, particularly given the economic
status of the population [9].
Despite efforts such as the Roll Back Malaria
program, some reports suggest that government-
led malaria control initiatives may face
challenges. While certain African countries
experienced a 50% reduction in malaria
incidence and deaths between 2000 and 2006
due to high intervention coverage and effective
surveillance (WHO World Malaria Report 2008),
Nigeria, especially concerning malaria in
pregnancy, has not shown similar progress. The
minimal impact in Nigeria is attributed to
resource constraints (Roll Back Malaria).
Malaria is a formidable global public health
challenge, particularly in African countries where
40% of the world's population resides in endemic
regions. Approximately 25 million pregnancies

occur annually in malaria-endemic areas of sub-
Saharan Africa, with notably high prevalence
among pregnant women and children under five.
In Nigeria, 48% of pregnant women were
diagnosed with malaria according to the Federal
Ministry of Health in 2005, underscoring the
severity of the issue [10].
In the southwestern region of Nigeria, previous
studies have documented malaria parasite
prevalence rates ranging from 60% to 72%
among pregnant women. Malaria during
pregnancy has been identified as a significant
contributor to maternal mortality, causing up to
10,000 deaths annually. Additionally, it leads to
elevated
rates of maternal morbidity,
characterized by symptoms such as fever and
severe anemia, particularly affecting first-time
mothers. The impact extends to adverse
outcomes such as low birth weight and placental
parasitemia, with an estimated 75,000 to 200,000
infant deaths attributed to malaria infection
during pregnancy each year. The detrimental
effects of malaria are most pronounced in the
first and second pregnancies of women residing
in areas of relatively stable transmission. The
temporary depression of immunity, facilitating the
development of the allograft (fetus), is cited as
one of the reasons for the heightened
susceptibility of pregnant women to malaria [11].
In response to this public health challenge,
Heads of Government and International
Agencies at the African Summit on Roll Back
Malaria (RBM) in Abuja in the year 2000
declared a commitment to reducing the malaria
burden by at least 50% by 2010. A widely
accepted measure in this endeavor involves the
utilization of Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs),
in
especially
malaria-endemic
regions.
Consequently, there has been the free
distribution of ITNs, donated by the Roll Back
Malaria initiative, targeting children under five
and pregnant women. Despite decades of
research, malaria in pregnancy (MiP) remains a
significant public health challenge that has
proven challenging to address. Numerous
studies from regions with diverse malaria
transmission patterns have explored the impact
of MiP on both maternal health and birth
outcomes. While the predominant consequence
of MiP on maternal health is often characterized
by anemia, there is a scarcity of data concerning
malaria-related maternal mortality. Regarding the
fetus, the most frequently observed adverse
effect of MiP is an elevated risk of low birth
weight (LBW), a critical factor associated with
impaired development and increased infant
mortality. However, many of these studies rely on
single measurement points, typically from cross-
sectional surveys or during delivery, failing to
capture the multifaceted factors that influence
MiP over an extended period [32,33].
Accurately assessing MiP is crucial for
understanding its effects on birth outcomes and
infant health, but it poses challenges due to the
involvement of various factors that are
sometimes difficult to fully capture [31 ,33]. The
continuity or intermittency of MiP depends on
factors such as a woman's exposure to vectors,
her level of immunity, potential co-infections
(e.g., other malaria species, HIV, or helminths),
and the efficacy of available treatment and
prevention
interventions.
Achieving
of MiP
comprehensive
understanding
necessitates considering these diverse factors
that play a role over an extended timeframe [12].
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Study Location
This study was conducted among women
attending antenatal care at four distinct hospitals
in Ikire, Irewole Local Government Area of Osun
State. The primary objective was to broaden our
understanding and collect pertinent data
essential for the study within Irewole Local
Government. Established in 1976 through the
Local Government Reform, Irewole Local
Government has its headquarters in Ikire.
Subsequently, Ayedaade Local Government and
Isokan Local Government areas were created in
1989 and 1996, respectively, from the original
Irewole Local Government.
Irewole Local
Government shares boundaries with Ayedaade
Local Government in the East, Ife-North Local
Government in the Southeast, and Egbeda Local
Government of Oyo state in the West. Isokan
Local Government is located in the southwestern
part of Osun State, with altitudes ranging
between 121.92 meters and 298.704 meters
above sea level. Covering an area of
approximately 978.67 square kilometers, Irewole
Local Government comprises over 300 villages
and hamlets.
Based on the provisional headcount figure from
1991, Irewole Local Government is estimated to
have a population of approximately 77,884. The
study aimed to leverage the diverse healthcare
settings within the local government to enrich our
research experience and acquire pertinent data
for the specified investigation.

2.2 Study Population
The target population
for
this
study
encompassed women of childbearing age who
have had or are currently experiencing
Local
pregnancy within
the
specified
Government. The study focused on women
actively seeking healthcare services during both
ante- and post-natal periods at hospitals or
clinics.
Ethical clearance was diligently obtained from
the relevant authority of
the hospital.
Subsequently, informed consent was secured
from all participants selected through random
sampling for the study. Prior to obtaining
consent, the purpose of the research was
thoroughly explained to each participant. It was
emphasized that participation was entirely
voluntary, and individuals had the right to decline
or withdraw from the study at any stage, even
after providing initial consent. Importantly,
patients who opted not to participate were
assured that their decision would not affect their
access to routine care available at the facility.
The study included a cohort of 200 pregnant
women regularly attending the antenatal clinic at
the hospital. The age range of the participants
spanned from 16 to 45 years. Exclusions from
the study comprised women currently on any
form of malaria chemoprophylaxis, those testing
positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
and individuals with sickle-cell disease. These
exclusions were made to ensure a more focused
and homogenous study population.
2.3 Design
and Adminstration of
Questionnaire
Two hundred (200) self-administered semi-
structured questionnaires were meticulously
designed and then distributed to pregnant
women to assess the impact of malaria. The
questionnaires sought information on various
including
socio-demographic
aspects ,
characteristics, the distribution pattern, and
prevalence of malaria fever among pregnant
women. Additionally, the survey delved into
environmental factors contributing to the spread
of malaria, the socio-economic status of the
mothers, and the public health management of
malaria. This comprehensive approach in
questionnaire development aimed to capture a
broad spectrum of data, enabling a thorough
analysis of the multifaceted factors related to
malaria among pregnant women.
2.4 Data Collection
and Sampling
Techniques
2.4.1 Primary data
To bolster the reliability of the research and
achieve its objectives, the study employed pre-
coded and semi-structured questionnaires.
These instruments were administered to a
sample of 200 pregnant women attending
antenatal care. The collected information
encompassed various domains, including socio-
demographic characteristics, the distribution
pattern, and prevalence of malaria fever among
pregnant women. Additionally, the questionnaires
delved into environmental factors contributing to
the spread of malaria, the socio-economic status
of the mothers, and the public health
management of malaria. The use of structured
questionnaires ensured a systematic and
standardized approach to data collection,
facilitating a comprehensive analysis of factors
related to malaria among pregnant women.
2.4.2 Secondary data
In addition to the questionnaire-based data
collection, information was gathered by visiting
multiple Health Centers in the study area. This
involved procuring records of malaria distribution
in pregnant women over the past four years
(2019-2022). By including this retrospective data,
the study aimed to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the trends and
patterns of malaria prevalence among pregnant
women in the specified timeframe. This dual
approach, combining current survey data with
historical health center records, contributes to a
more nuanced analysis and interpretation of the
factors influencing malaria distribution in the
study area.
2.5 Sample Selection
The sample selection for this research was
conducted through a random process among
pregnant women registered for antenatal care at
the selected hospitals. Specifically, every third
woman attending the antenatal clinic, occurring
every other day, was chosen to participate in the
study. Selected individuals were provided with
detailed information about the research, including
its purpose, and their consent for participation
was obtained before any sample collection took
place. This approach to sample selection
ensures a degree of randomness and
representation among the pregnant women
4


Oladeji et al.,• Asian J. Preg. Childb., vol. 7, no. 1, pp. 1-14, 2024; Article no.AJPCB. 111012
participating in the study, enhancing the reliability
and validity of the research findings. Additionally,
the informed consent process upheld ethical
standards by clearly communicating the study's
objectives and obtaining voluntary agreement
from the selected participants.
2.6 Validity and Reliability of the
Questionnaire/ Instrument
Content Validity: The questionnaire was
carefully designed to ensure content validity.
Experts in the field of public health and malaria
research reviewed the questions to confirm that
they effectively addressed the intended
variables. This process enhances the content
validity, ensuring that the instrument accurately
measures the desired constructs.
Face Validity: Before distribution, a pilot test
involving a small group of pregnant women was
conducted to assess
the clarity and
appropriateness of the questions. Adjustments
were made based on their feedback, contributing
to face validity by confirming that the instrument
appeared relevant and understandable to the
target population.
Construct Validity: The questionnaire aimed to
measure a variety of constructs related to
malaria, including socio-demographic factors,
prevalence, environmental contributors, socio-
economic status, and public health management.
This comprehensive coverage enhances the
construct validity, ensuring that the questionnaire
effectively measures the intended variables.
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Reliability: To
reliability ,
the
ensure
questionnaire incorporated consistency checks
and clear instructions. Test-retest reliability
was assessed by administering the questionnaire
to a subset of participants on two occasions,
ensuring that responses remained stable over
time.
2.7 Control of Confounding Variables
The
of
Randomization:
distribution
questionnaires was randomized to minimize the
impact of unknown or unmeasured confounding
variables. This approach helps ensure that any
confounding factors are equally distributed
across the study population.
Statistical Control: During data analysis,
advanced statistical methods,
such as
multivariate analysis. This allows for a more
accurate assessment of the relationship between
the studied variables.
Stratification: Stratification involves analyzing
and presenting data within subgroups, which
helps identify and control for potential
confounding variables. Stratified analysis allows
for a more nuanced understanding of the
relationships among variables.
By employing these strategies, the study aimed
to enhance the validity and reliability of the
questionnaire while minimizing the impact of
confounding variables, thereby strengthening the
overall robustness of the research findings.

relatively low overall rate of hospitalization
among the registered pregnant women during
this period. A similar trend is observed at Omoda
Health Centre Ikire, where admissions were
notably low, reaching 100% non-admission for all
registered pregnant women in 2020. Although
there is a slight increase in admissions in 2022,
infrequent
the overall pattern
indicates
hospitalizations. Emmanuel Hospital Ikire also
reflects a relatively low admission rate, with the
highest recorded rate being 4.5% in 2022. In
contrast, Boluwatife Convalescent Home Ikire,
categorized as a primary health center with
limited facilities, primarily treated pregnant
women as outpatients, resulting in recorded
admissions of NIL. This collective data across
healthcare facilities suggests a noteworthy
observation: a substantial number of pregnant
women may not have undergone malaria
parasite tests unless prompted by specific
complaints, indicating a potential gap in
systematic testing practices. This highlights the
need for a more comprehensive and proactive
approach to screening pregnant women for
malaria parasites, ensuring early detection and
appropriate management for the well-being of
both the mothers and their unborn children
[1 3, 14].
The findings from the conducted study reveal a
concerning prevalence of malaria among
pregnant women in the study area. A substantial
58% of the tested pregnant women were positive
for malaria parasites, indicating a high burden of
the disease within the community. Further
analysis of the results shows that 10% of the
cases exhibited a high level of malaria parasites,
suggesting a significant proportion of individuals
with a more severe and potentially complicated
infection. Additionally, 17% displayed scanty
malaria parasites, which may point to early or
mild-stage infections.
In contrast, 12% of the tested pregnant women
showed no detectable malaria parasites, while
3% had no parasites of any kind. While this is a
positive aspect, it highlights the need for a
nuanced understanding of the varying degrees of
infection within the population.
The overall prevalence rates underscore the
urgent need for targeted interventions to address
the high incidence of malaria among pregnant
women in the area. Implementing robust and
timely interventions, such as widespread testing,
preventive measures, and appropriate treatment

protocols, is essential to mitigate the impact of
malaria on maternal and fetal health. These
results serve as a critical call to action for public
health authorities and healthcare providers to
prioritize and implement effective strategies to
combat malaria in the local pregnant population.
The outcomes of the study conducted on non-
pregnant women in the area reveal a noteworthy
prevalence of malaria within this demographic.
Among the non-pregnant women tested, a
substantial 20% were found positive for malaria
parasites, underscoring the presence of the
disease in this group. Further examination of the
results indicates that 10% of these cases
exhibited a high level of malaria parasites,
suggesting a notable proportion facing a more
severe and potentially complicated infection.
In addition, 10% of the non-pregnant women
showed scanty malaria parasites, potentially
indicative of early or mild-stage infections.
Interestingly, 30% had no detectable malaria
parasites, while another 30% had no parasites of
any kind. Although these figures provide a
positive aspect, emphasizing a substantial
portion without any detectable parasites, it's
crucial to acknowledge the 20% with positive
results.
These findings bring to light the importance of
implementing effective control measures for
malaria in the general non-pregnant population.
The prevalence among non-pregnant women
signals the need for comprehensive strategies,
including widespread testing,
preventive
interventions, and appropriate treatment, to curb
the impact of malaria on the overall health of the
community. The results serve as a valuable
resource for public health authorities and
healthcare providers to tailor interventions that
address the specific dynamics of malaria
transmission within the non-pregnant female
population in the area.
4. DISCUSSION
4.1 Table 2: Distribution Pattern and
Prevalence of Malaria Among
Pregnant Women in Irewole LGA,
Osun State
The findings from Table 2 highlight a
commendable level of awareness and
understanding of malaria among pregnant
women in Irewole LGA, Osun State. All
respondents (100%) demonstrated knowledge
about malaria, its transmission, and had
experienced a malaria attack, aligning with
similar studies globally [15,16]. The timing of
recent malaria attacks, with 28.2% reporting
incidents within the past week, emphasizes the
urgency for timely intervention strategies and
continuous monitoring, consistent with findings in
a neighboring state [17].
Moreover,
the majority of
respondents
recognized the potential fatality of untreated
malaria (93.2%) and common symptoms
(93.2%), consistent with studies in different
countries, illustrating a global understanding of
the severe consequences of untreated malaria
during pregnancy [18, 19].
4.2 Table 3: Enabling Factors Facilitating
the Spread of Malaria Among
Pregnant Women
Table 3 reveals a strong awareness among
respondents regarding environmental factors
11


Oladeji et al.,• Asian J. Preg. Childb., vol. 7, no. 1, pp. 1-14, 2024; Article no.AJPCB. 111012
contributing to the spread of malaria. Similar
studies in malaria-endemic regions have
highlighted the significance of environmental
factors in malaria transmission [20,21]. The
acknowledgment of poor sanitation (67.2%) and
overgrown weeds (90.4%) aligns with a study in
a different Nigerian locality, suggesting that
interventions addressing environmental factors
could be universally applied in various regions
[22].
4.3 Table 4: Socio-economic Status of
Mothers Regarding Malaria Epidemics
Table 4 explores the socio-economic aspects
influencing malaria epidemics among pregnant
women. The belief that one's occupation
determines the density of malaria (89.8%)
echoes findings from a study in a neighboring
state [23]. However, the majority disputing the
impact of income on the effect of malaria fever
on pregnancy (90.4%) contrasts with a study in a
different African region, emphasizing the need for
context-specific
interventions
[24].
The
recognition of the role of education in the spread
of malaria fever (50.3%) suggests a potential
knowledge gap that requires targeted health
education campaigns, resonating with a study in
a similar context [25].
4.4 Table 5: Public Health Management of
Malaria
Table 5 delves into treatment-seeking behavior
and practices related to malaria management.
The diverse range of health-seeking practices,
including visits to quack traditional men or
prophets (21.5%), reflects a complex health
landscape that requires culturally sensitive
interventions. The preference for specific
antimalarial drugs, such as Sulphadoxine or
pyrimethamine (fansidar) by 87.6%
of
respondents, is consistent with regional drug
preferences documented in a study in a
neighboring state [26]. However, the varying
the effectiveness of
perceptions about
Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) (44.1%)
suggest a need for targeted awareness
campaigns on the efficacy of modern antimalarial
treatments [27].
4.5 Table 6: Hospital Patronage by
Pregnant Women from 2019 to 2022
The data presented in Table 6 provides insights
into hospital patronage patterns among pregnant
women. The low admission rates in various
health facilities suggest a tendency for pregnant
women to seek healthcare outside formal
hospital settings, aligning with findings from
studies in other Nigerian states [28,29].
4.6 Comparison with Other Research
Several parallels with existing
research
underscore the consistency of findings regarding
environmental factors,
socio-
awareness,
economic influences, and healthcare-seeking
behaviors among pregnant women in malaria-
endemic regions [30,31]. However, nuanced
differences highlight the need for tailored
interventions considering local contexts and
perceptions [32,33].
5. CONCLUSION
Malaria remains a significant public health
challenge in Africa, affecting approximately 45
countries, including Nigeria, where about 588
million people are at risk. Pregnant women and
their unborn babies are particularly vulnerable to
malaria infection, posing a threat to life in
communities. The study focused on Irewole
Local Government,
revealing the typical
characteristics of a malaria-endemic area.
Despite the challenges, the study emphasizes
that concerted efforts, community awareness,
and effective strategies can bring about positive
change.
The research uncovered overlooked intricacies
that, if addressed, could contribute to reducing
the scourge of the disease. It shed light on the
strengths and weaknesses of both governmental
and non-governmental approaches to public
health problems. Governments are urged to
move beyond lip service and take substantive
actions to address issues affecting citizens.
6. RECOMMENDATIONS
To address the prevalent challenges of malaria in
the study area, a multifaceted approach is
recommended. Aggressive vector
control
strategies should be implemented at both
community and household levels, integrating
them into a comprehensive plan to manage and
reduce malaria transmission. Promoting the use
of insecticide-treated nets and exploring
innovative methods to enhance net effectiveness
can significantly interrupt human-vector contact.
Intermittent preventive treatment, particularly with
sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine, during the second
12

and third trimesters is advised for pregnant
women, with special attention to those who are
HIV positive.
Prioritizing
environmental
sanitation, coupled with aggressive information
dissemination campaigns, will further contribute
to a robust malaria prevention and control
strategy. Engaging various stakeholders in these
efforts is crucial for success, requiring resource
allocation and logistical support for effective
implementation.
Adopting
these
recommendations promises a more holistic
approach to combating malaria in the study area
and beyond.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can provide various functions and advantages to
healthcare delivery. Quality healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth is of vital importance, and machine
learning-based CDSSs have shown positive impact on pregnancy care.
Objective: This paper aims to investigate what has been done in CDSSs in the context of pregnancy care using
machine learning, and what aspects require attention from future researchers.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review of existing literature following a structured process of literature
search, paper selection and filtering, and data extraction and synthesis.
Results: 17 research papers were identified on the topic of CDSS development for different aspects of pregnancy
care using various machine learning algorithms. We discovered an overall lack of explainability in the proposed
models. We also observed a lack of experimentation, external validation and discussion around culture, ethnicity
and race from the source data, with most studies using data from a single centre or country, and an overall lack
of awareness of applicability and generalisability of the CDSSs regarding different populations. Finally, we found
a gap between machine learning practices and CDSS implementation, and an overall lack of user testing.
Conclusioru• Machine learning-based CDSSs are still under-explored in the context of pregnancy care. Despite
the open problems that remain, the few studies that tested a CDSS for pregnancy care reported positive effects,
reinforcing the potential of such systems to improve clinical practice. We encourage future researchers to take
into consideration the aspects we identified in order for their work to translate into clinical use.
The rapid advancement of computer technology has led to an in-
creasing interest in clinical decision support systems (CDSSs), which
are computer systems designed to "impact clinician decision making
about individual patients at the point in time that these decisions are
made" [1]. CDSSs can provide various functions and advantages to
healthcare delivery, such as reducing medication errors and adverse
events, improving clinical management, controlling costs, providing ad-
ministrative function/automation, supporting diagnostics and decision
making, improving documentation, and streamlining clinical workflow
[2]. CDSSs can be especially helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic,
when many clinicians have turned to telemedicine in response to the
need for social distancing [3].

CDSSs can be classified as knowledge-based and non-knowledge-
based. A knowledge-based CDSS typically includes a knowledge base
consisting of compiled information that is often in the form of rules,
and it combines the rules with patient data using an inference engine
or reasoning mechanism to create outputs [1]. On the contrary, non-
knowledge-based CDSSs are data-based and they do not rely directly on
medical guidelines or knowledge. A common type of non-knowledge-
based CDSSs uses machine learning techniques, and this type of CDSSs
is often referred to as machine learning-based CDSSs. Machine learning
is a type of artificial intelligence (A1) that learns from historical data
and uses what it learned to predict the outcomes for new data. It is a
powerful tool to address complex problems, and it can handle varieties
of data, including numerical, categorical, time series, textual and im-
age data. Machine learning is widely adapted in the medical field [4 5

and it has shown revolutionary improvements in many aspects of the
healthcare process [6]. Consequently, there has been a rapid growth in
machine learning-based CDSSs to help clinicians make better and more
informed decisions [7].
Bias has been a major concern when applying machine learning in
practice, as biases in the data, such as ethnicity, race or gender, can
result in a biased model. In the field of medicine, there is a growing
demand for A1 approaches to be trustworthy, transparent, interpretable
and explainable [8]. Antoniadi et al. [9] indicated that explainability is
a critical component for the effective uptake of CDSSs in practice, and
it may become a requirement in the future due to ethical, regulatory,
and societal pressures. This calls for explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) to help uncover potential sources of bias, and make the results
of A1 systems more understandable to humans [10]. Various benefits
have been reported as a result of the use of XAI, however, XAI is still
not applied sufficiently in the context of machine learning-based CDSSs
Quality healthcare during pregnancy and childbirth can prevent ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes, including maternal deaths and stillbirths
[11]. In the context of pregnancy care, studies have shown that CDSSs
can identify complications during pregnancy, improve quality of intra-
partum care, facilitate reduction of labor complications and improve
pregnancy outcomes [12, 13]. A1 and machine learning are being stud-
ied to theoretically optimize a variety of pregnancy outcomes, however,
only a small proportion of studies that use Al/machine learning to
improve pregnancy outcomes have developed CDSSs as an effort to
translate into clinical care [14].
In this paper, we comprehensively reviewed existing literature on
CDSSs in the context of pregnancy care that incorporate machine learn-
ing techniques. We aimed to identify what has been done in this field,
and what aspects require attention from future researchers.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: in Section 2, we
describe the structured processes used to conduct this review, including
our research questions; Section 3 presents what we discovered from
literature in response to the research questions; Section 4 discusses the
implications of our findings; in Section 5, we conclude this paper.
2. Methods
This systematic literature review was conducted following the struc-
tured process used by Antoniadi et al. [9], which is adapted from the
guidelines by Kitchenham and Charters [15]. The stages of this review
are structured as follows:
• Specifying the research questions
• Conducting searches of specified databases
• Selecting studies by criterion
• Filtering studies by evaluating their pertinence
• Extracting data
• Synthesizing results
2.1. Research questions
This review aims to answer the following research questions (RQs):
RQI: What studies have been conducted towards the development
of CDSSs that used machine learning in the context of pregnancy care,
and what machine learning/AI methods were used?
RQ2: Are the machine learning models developed in these studies
explainable?
RQ3: Have the models been developed using data from a specific
population? Have these studies explored cultural/ethnic/racial effects?
RQ4: What CDSSs have been implemented and have they been tested
in clinical practice?

2.2. Conducting searches
Fig. 1 shows the overview of the workflow for the literature search,
paper selection and filtering. We searched Google Scholar, the most
comprehensive academic search engine according to recent studies [16
17]. We conducted the search on 18 October 2021 using the following
search terms (Sl-S2) and the number of papers returned is shown in
brackets after each search term.
• Sl: "clinical decision support system" "machine learning" preg-
nancy (888)
• S2: CDSS "machine learning" pregnancy (501)
A total of 1053 non-duplicated publications were returned.
2.3. Paper selection and filtering
We omitted papers other than peer-reviewed conference or journal
papers, including books, book chapters, theses, dissertations, reports,
proposals, slides, abstracts, posters, pre-prints or other archived articles
(n 368). We also excluded non-English publications (n = 21). 664
papers remained after this filtering.
We performed a quality check of the remaining papers. We only in-
cluded papers published in ACM or IEEE journals, or journals that were
listed in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) 2018 (https://clarivate.
com/webofsciencegroup/tag/jcr-2018/, accessed on 19 October 2021),

excluded). Moreover, five of the included papers were unavailable on
any platform at our disposal and were thus omitted. This reduced the
number of remaining papers to 360 (journal papers: n 292; confer-
ence papers: n 68).
We then selected papers based on their relevance to this review,
i.e. papers that described the design or development of CDSS in the
context of pregnancy care using machine learning. The first inclusion
criterion was that the paper must mention "clinical decision support
system" or CDSS, "machine learning" and pregnancy in the title, key-
word, abstract or main text. Furthermore, if "clinical decision support
system" or CDSS, "machine learning" and/or pregnancy was only men-
tioned in the introduction, background and/or related work section or
as future work only, the paper was excluded from this review. How-
ever, we allowed one paper which did not mention "machine learning"
in appropriate sections but was deemed relevant based on the method
used in the paper. The second inclusion criterion was that the paper
must be specific to the context of pregnancy care. Papers about CDSSs
in a non-pregnancy-care-specific context, such as neonatology and dia-
betes mellitus (including type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes), were
excluded. Note that we included papers when the focus was only on
gestational diabetes. In total, 335 papers that were out of scope were
excluded. Moreover, five papers that only use pregnancy-related com-
plications as a case study, example or evaluation dataset were omitted
and marked as "case study only".
Finally, 20 papers were selected and separated into: three review
papers [14,18,19] and 17 research papers [20—36]. For the purpose of
this review, the three literature review papers were moved to a separate
category "review papers".
2.4. Extracting data and synthesis
To ensure the quality of review, two independent reviewers read
the 17 research papers thoroughly and extracted useful information
from these papers. Any disagreement between reviewers was resolved
by consensus or by a third reviewer.

3. Results
3.1. RQI: what CDSSs have been developed that used machine learning in
the context of pregnancy care and what machine learning/AI methods were
used?
There are various studies on or towards the development of machine
learning-based CDSSs to assist healthcare delivery at different stages of
pregnancy, and different machine learning techniques were used. They
are summarised in Table
1.
The studies cover preconception, early pregnancy, prenatal, intra-
partum, and postpartum stages. Most of the studies aimed to support
diagnosis, prognosis and treatment in maternal and fetal care during
pregnancy and childbirth, and the majority focused on the prenatal
and intrapartum period. In addition, the majority of studies aimed
to develop CDSSs that are exclusively machine learning-based/non-
knowledge-based. Only one paper [27] described the development of
CDSS that involves both machine learning techniques and a rule-based
knowledge base, which makes a hybrid of knowledge-based and non-
knowledge-based system.
There has been a growing number of papers published regarding
development of machine learning-based CDSSs in the context of preg-
nancy care in the last few years, as shown in Fig. 2. This can be partly
explained by a rise of publications that study cardiotocograms, which
may be a result of the availability of two open-access cardiotocography
datasets, UCI Machine Learning Repository Cardiotocography Data Set
[37] and CTU-CHB Intrapartum Cardiotocography Database [38].
Fig. 3 shows different machine learning predictive algorithms and
the number of papers that applied them (note that machine learning
methods for feature extraction, feature selection etc., are excluded).
Most papers applied supervised learning methods, while only one pa-
per applied an unsupervised learning algorithm. The most widely-used

Fig. 4. Number of Papers that Applied White-Box and Black-Box Algorithms for CDSSs.
algorithms for CDSSs in pregnancy care are support vector machine
(SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN), which were used in six and
seven papers included in this review respectively. The remainder of
the predictive algorithms (decision tree, logistic regression, random for-
est, naive Bayes, combination of k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and naive
Bayes, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), success estimation using a rank-
ing algorithm (SERA), expectation maximization (EM) clustering) are
less common as they were used by one or two papers only. There is
a trend towards the use of complex predictive algorithms (e.g. ANN,
SVM, random forest and AdaBoost) in the development of CDSSs for
pregnancy care since 2016.
3.2. RQ2: are the machine learning models developed in these studies
explainable?
Explainability provides insights into the decision-making process of
the machine learning-based CDSSs. There are two types of explanation
methods: ante-hoc and post-hoc methods. Ante-hoc methods involve de-
veloping machine learning models that are inherently transparent, such
as linear and logistic regression, decision tree and kNN. They reveal
the decision logic to users and are referred to as "white-box" models.
When non-explainable "black-box" algorithms (ANNs, SVMs, random
forests etc.) are used, the models developed can be explained in a
post-hoc manner. Post-hoc methods generate approximations of the de-
cision logic of the models. Post-hoc explanations can be split into global
explanations, which provide an overall understanding into a model's
behavior, and local explanations which explain why a particular deci-
sion/output is made.
Regarding the proportion of papers that develop white-box and
black-box machine learning models for CDSSs for pregnancy care,
23.5% used white-box models only, which provide ante-hoc explana-
tions. The majority (64.7%) of the papers developed black-box models
only, and 11.8% developed both white-box and black-box models. As
shown in Fig. 4, an increasing trend of using black-box models for
CDSS development for pregnancy care in recent years, especially be-
tween 2016 and 2018, is observed. However, the number of papers
using white-box models remains roughly stable after 2008.
Among the papers that applied black-box algorithms for CDSSs in
the context of pregnancy care, only one applied post-hoc explanation
methods. Tortajada et al. [35] applied pruning, which consists in delet-

4. Discussion
Machine learning-based CDSSs have been developed to assist clini-
cians in various stages and aspects of pregnancy care, from preconcep-
tion to postpartum stages. The main focus is on supporting diagnosis,
prognosis and treatment for both pregnant women and babies during
pregnancy and childbirth. The limited number (n =
17) of publica-
tions towards the development of machine learning-based CDSSs for
pregnancy care suggests that it is still an under-explored area. How-
ever, there is an increase in the number of studies in this field in recent
years, partly because of the rise in research studying cardiotocography
data using machine learning.
As explainability is becoming increasingly prominent for A1 systems,
it was of interest to identify to what extent these studies incorporated
this element in their work. CDSS explainability has the potential to
enhance the clinicians' trust towards the system [
l, while high
47,48
accuracy alone is insufficient [49], especially as it is often achieved by
complex and opaque models. Arrieta et al. [50] have recommended that
black-box models should be selected only when necessary and the use
of white-box models should be prioritised over complex algorithms that
require the application of post-hoc XAI techniques. The use of black-
box models is prevalent in machine learning-based CDSSs for pregnancy
care, especially in the past few years. Although there is an increasing de-
mand to make A1 approaches explainable in medicine, an overall lack of
explainability and application of XAI methods is observed in this field.
More than half of the CDSSs are not explainable. A small proportion
used white-box algorithms, and only one paper used a model-specific
post-hoc explanation to explain black-box machine learning models
globally. Besides, it comes to our attention that Du et al. [51
] provided
both post-hoc global and local explanations in a web-based CDSS for
the prediction of gestational diabetes mellitus, which was published af-
ter the literature search of this review. With recent user studies showing
the importance of XAI in CDSSs [52—55], future researchers in related
fields should consider incorporating explainability into the system de-
sign. Also, it is recommended in the World Health Organisation (WHO)
A1 Guidelines for Health [56].
There is a lack of awareness or specification of the cultural/eth-
nic/racial groups in the training data. Most studies used data collected
in a single centre, or multiple centres within the same country. This
is likely to reflect the local population and limits the diversity of par-
ticipants. As machine learning is data-based, it could limit the appli-
cability and validity of the CDSSs on other populations. This calls for
cross-cultural/ethnic/racial validation of the CDSSs to evaluate system
generalisability in difference populations, and studies on more diverse
populations. If the former is not possible, researchers should report
the cultural/ethnic/racial distribution or bias in the data and clearly
specify the applicability of the CDSSs in case of misuse. Additionally,
when reporting clinical trials involving interventions of an Al/machine
learning-based CDSS, the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials—
Artificial Intelligence (CONSORT-A1) [57] call for descriptions of how
input data for the CDSS are acquired and the populations for which
CDSS intervention can be safely implemented. This applies to machine
learning-based CDSSs not only in the context of pregnancy care, but
also in other medical fields.
Although several studies have addressed major unmet needs in
the area of pregnancy care with the use of machine learning mod-
els for CDSS development, we identified that their research has, in
most cases, remained experimental. In addition, only a very limited
amount of machine learning-based CDSSs have been tested by clini-
cal users. Nonetheless, in these studies, positive feedback was received
regarding reducing diagnostic errors, supporting diagnosis and treat-
ments, and reducing clinicians' workload. This highlights the potential
of such systems in improving healthcare delivery, especially in rural ar-
eas where the healthcare practitioners might not be specialists [
23,26]
For future researchers who aim to test machine learning-based CDSSs in
International Journal of Medical Informatics 173 (2023) 105040
randomised trials, it is recommended to follow the CONSORT-A1 [57]
and report the trials in a transparent and complete manner.
In this work, we identified several aspects that require attention in
order for machine learning-based CDSSs to transfer into clinical use. In
addition to those, there are other persisting challenges including miss-
ing values [24], outliers [31], and class imbalance [33]. These issues are
common in medical datasets and need to be addressed appropriately.
We comprehensively reviewed CDSSs incorporating machine learn-
ing techniques for pregnancy care. Many of our findings are aligned
with previous reviews in related fields. Davidson et al. [19] identified
limited external validation in A1 in maternal healthcare. Dhombres et
al. [58] found a lack of external validation and the fact that the contri-
butions of A1 remain at the level of "proof of concept" in the use of A1 in
the obstetrics and gynecology domain. Davidson et al. [14] discovered
a lack of clinical adoption in the use of A1 and machine learning to im-
prove pregnancy outcomes. Drukker et al. [59] pointed out challenges
with black-box models and the absence of wide-scale multi-centre clin-
ical studies in the use of A1 in ultrasound imaging in obstetrics and
gynecology. These indicate that the gaps we identified have implica-
tions on a broader context, providing guidelines for future researchers.
The contributions of our review are highlighted by a novel focus
on machine learning-based CDSSs, an area that endeavors to trans-
late machine learning studies into clinical application, and an in-depth
analysis of explainability, cultural/ethnic/racial bias, system implemen-
tation and user testing. The literature search was conducted on Google
Scholar, an academic search engine with a high level of comprehen-
siveness. As opposed to Dhombres et al. [58] who focused on obstetrics
and gynecology core journals only, many of the papers we selected
were published in multidisciplinary journals of computer science and
medicine, giving a more extensive overview of relevant literature.
One of the limitations of this review is that the studies that were
not written in English or not accessible were excluded. Additionally,
the use of "pregnancy" as a search keyword may have led to the omis-
Sion of some papers that focus on preconception and postpartum care.
Nevertheless, this review provides valuable insight into the state-of-the-
art in this field, and the aspects that require further research, guiding
future researchers in related fields.
5. Conclusion
This systematic review comprehensively reviewed and summarised
studies towards the development of CDSSs using machine learning for
different aspects of pregnancy care. It is observed that black-box algo-
rithms are the most popular especially in recent years, while the need
for explainability in the models or systems is not sufficiently addressed.
We discovered that there is an overall lack of awareness, experimen-
tation, external validation and discussion around culture, ethnicity or
race, and a lack of CDSS implementation and user testing. Despite
the open problems that remain, positive feedback from clinicians was
reported on the CDSSs that were tested, reinforcing the potential of
such systems to improve clinical practice. Our findings can serve as
guidelines for future researchers in related fields to assist them in in-
corporating their work in clinical practice and having a higher impact
in the delivery of personalised care.

Introduction
ABSTRACT
Introductiorr Barriers to family planning for potential clients have been explored in the literature, but rarely from
the perspective of the women themselves in a low-income setting. This research aimed to understand clients'
perspectives on being turned away from receiving a method of family planning at a facility on the day it was
sought.
Methods: Three focus group discussions were held in two districts of Malawi in 2019 with clients who had been
turned away approximately three to six months prior.
Results: The reasons for turnaway participants mentioned fell into eight categories: no proof of not being preg-
nant, method and/or supply stock-outs, arriving late, provider unavailable, provider refusal, needing to wait
longer after delivery of a child, financial constraints, and medical reasons. Participants were often turned away
more than once before finally being able to initiate a method, in some cases returning to the same facility and in
others finding it through community health workers, traditional healers, or private facilities. Clients often
resorted to sleeping apart from their husbands until they could initiate a method and reported stress and worry
resulting from being turned away.
Conclusions: Clients are turned away without a method of FP on the day they seek one for multiple reasons, nearly
all of which are preventable. Many examples given by the participants showed a lack of knowledge and respect
for clients on the part of the providers. Changing attitudes and behaviour, however, may be difficult and will
require additional steps. Increasing the availability and use of pregnancy tests, having a more reliable supply of
methods and materials, increasing the number of providers—including those trained well in all methods—and
providing daily FP services would all help reduce turnaway. Improved access to family planning will help
counties achieve their Sustainable Development Goals.
The importance of high-quality family planning (FP) services in
achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be under-
estimated. Traditionally recognised for its role in maternal and child
health, FP also contributes to the success of the SDGs in eliminating
extreme poverty, increasing health and well-being, ensuring quality
education for all, and lessening the impact of climate change, among
others (
). In 2019, 218 million
Starbird et al., 2016; United Nations, 2015
women in low- and middle-income countries were estimated to have an
unmet need for FP (
sully et al., 2020
). In many cases, unmet need can be
attributed to the various barriers women face in accessing FP (
Starrs
et al., 2018)
Women must often overcome many barriers to FP before even
reaching a facility that provides it, including taking time away from
domestic or income-generating responsibilities to obtain services,
finding the resources needed to arrive at the facility, and in some cases,
doing so while concealing their reason for the visit. Women can

encounter other barriers after arriving at the facility, resulting in them
being turned away without receiving a method. Those FP barriers that
have been frequently categorised in the literature include geographic
(e.g., long distances between clients and services), financial (e.g., un-
affordable methods, services, or transportation to obtain a method), and
medical barriers (Bertrand et al., 1995; Campbell et al., 2006; Starrs
). Medical barriers can include non-medically necessary
et al., 2018
policies or practices 'that inappropriately prevent clients from receiving
the contraceptive method of their choice or impose unnecessary process
barriers to access family planning services' (Bertrand et al., 1995
For
example, a medical barrier could include requiring direct observation of
menstruation (i.e., a soiled menstrual pad) to rule out pregnancy, lab
tests, or vaccinations (Campbell et al., 2006; Stanback et al., 1997;
Brunie et al., 2013; Hazel et al., 2021
). Clients may also face barriers due
to a lack of information on how FP or particular methods work,
stock-outs of supplies or methods, or bias on the part of providers (Solo
and Festin, 2019; Campbell et al., 2006; Bertrand et al., 1995)
In the case of provider bias, providers may require clients to be
married or of a certain age or they may impose their own beliefs
regarding ideal family size or spacing of pregnancies, including limiting
the use of contraception for nulliparous women or women who have had
fewer than the socially accepted number of children (Campbell et al.,
2006; Stanback and Twum-Baah, 2001; Tavrow et al., 1995; Tumlinson
). Providers may also determine the method dispensed to a
et al., 2015
client based on ease of initiation or availability of supplies rather than
client preference (Solo and Festin, 2019; Farmer et al., 2015; Hasselback
et al., 2017)
Many of the barriers to FP are related to the social determinants of
health, including economic status, area of residence, education, social
inclusion and non-discrimination, and access to affordable, quality
health care (Marmot et al., 2008). These are defined by the WHO as
'non-medical factors that influence health outcomes' (World Health
Organization, 2022b; Marmot et al., 2008). While social determinants of
health exist in countries of all income levels, they can be harder to
overcome in low- and middle-income countries, where resources and
alternatives are more limited
(World Health Organization, 2022b)
Overcoming or minimizing the impact of social determinants of health is
a key element in helping the world to meet the 17 SDGs and achieving
equity in health, yet their presence can be noted in many of the afore-
mentioned barriers to FP (
United Nations, 2015)
The term 'turnaway' was first used by researchers exploring access to
abortion services in the United States from 2008—2016 (Biggs et al.,
). In the 1990s, Tavrow at al. showed that many
2017; Foster, 2021
Malawian women were denied FP at the facility entrance before even
seeing a provider for reasons including missing group counselling,
coming on a non-family planning day, provider unavailability, and un-
availability of commodities (Tavrow et al., 1995). More than two de-
cades later, further research showed that Malawian women were still
being turned away from FP services for reasons including refusing other
services such as an HIV test or vaccination or a facility being closed
during normal operating hours (
Hazel et al., 2021
). Turnaway in Malawi
also resulted from closures or understaffing of facilities, long wait times,
stock-out of methods preferred by the women, or FP being offered only
on certain days of the week (Peterson et al., 2022b)
Unlike evidence on the presence and types of barriers to accessing FP
facing women, evidence on the impact of denying FP methods is sparse
). Although related issues such as a limited
(Solo and Festin, 2019
method mix resulting from provider bias or method stock-outs have
been explored, these studies have not given a strong voice to women on
the effects on their lives of limited choice and access (Solo and Festin,
2019; Bertrand et al., 1995
). In this paper, we aim to give women the
opportunity to describe their experiences with turnaway from FP in
Malawi and explore and analyse the reasons women understood they
were turned away and the potential outcomes and consequences.

Setting
Malawi is a country of approximately 20.8 million people located in
southern Africa (Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 2022). It is divided
into three regions and 28 districts, with approximately 82% of the
population living in rural areas (Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
). Christianity is the most common religion, with 77% of the pop-
2022
ulation practising some type of Christianity, whereas Muslims account
for 12% of the population (Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), 2022)
Malawi has a total fertility rate of 4.4, an infant mortality rate of 42
per 1,000 live births, and a maternal mortality ratio of 349 per 100,000
live births (Malawi National Statistics Office, 2017; World Health Or-
ganization, 2019). The modern contraceptive prevalence rate for mar-
ried women is 58%, with an unmet need for FP of 19% (Malawi National
Statistics Office, 2017); the turnaway rate has been estimated to be 15%
for three districts studied (Peterson et al., 2022b). Fewer than three--
quarters (72%) of women are literate (Malawi National Statistics Office,
). Malawi was one of few sub-Saharan African countries to reach
2017
the Millennium Development Goal 4, to lower child mortality, which
was achieved through general health system strengthening, among other
activities (Gunnlaugsson and Einarsdöttir, 2018; Haraldsdöttir et al.,
2021)
From 1982 to 1992, Malawi had a conservative FP policy in place
requiring women to be married, undergo a full physical exam, meet age
and parity restrictions, and have permission from their husbands to
initiate FP (Tavrovv, 1999; Devlin et al., 2017). Health facilities offered
FP services only once per week (Tavrow, 1999). In 1992, the Ministry of
Health and Population (MOHP) introduced a new FP policy relaxing
many of these restrictions (
). The policy eliminated re-
Tavrow, 1999
quirements related to age, parity, and permission of husband and
allowed FP for limiting births rather than just birth spacing. It also set
the expectation that FP services should be offered daily at MOHP
facilities.
Today, trained community health workers in Malawi are allowed to
initiate women on oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) and injectable
contraception, but facility-based services remain an important source of
FP for many women in Malawi (Government of Malawi Ministry of
). Facility-based FP services are usually provided by nurses,
Health, 2009
midwives, clinicians, and health surveillance assistants (HSAs), who
generally start with a group counselling session for prospective clients,
which is held in the morning. During each session, various FP methods
are explained to clients, including their possible side effects. After the
group counselling session has ended, clients speak with providers indi-
vidually to decide upon and receive a method, as appropriate and
available.
Methodology
This qualitative study was part of a larger mixed-method study that
gathered data on clients and providers from FP units in 30 health fa-
cilities in three districts in Malawi from October to December 2019
Peterson et al., 2022b; Peterson et al., 2022a). In the first part of the
study, clients who were turned away from receiving a method of FP at a
facility on the day they sought one participated in a survey on the day of
turnaway. Clients who agreed and provided a phone number were fol-
lowed up six- and 12-weeks post turnaway. At the time of the 12-week
follow-up visit—or the six-week follow-up for those reporting preg-
nancy at six weeks—research assistants asked clients via telephone if
they would be willing to participate in a focus group discussion (FGD).
The two districts with the highest turnaway rates were selected for the
FGDs. Data collectors attempted to reach all clients who lived in the two
selected districts and stopped when they had eight participants agreeing
to participate. No alternate participants were selected. Turned-away
clients were eligible for an FGD if they had access to a phone, were
willing to be contacted, and expressed interest in participating.
We chose to use FGDs to allow women to share their experiences in

their own words. Qualitative research, including FGDs, allows for a
greater understanding of complex issues than quantitative methods
alone and offers greater opportunities to bring unanticipated findings to
light (
Baum, 1995; Bryman, 1984; Krueger and Casey, 2000
). In our
case, a qualitative methodology put the turned-away clients in the po-
sition of expert witnesses and allowed researchers to see the world
through their eyes (Bryman, 1984). In some cultures, participants may
feel shy about sharing personal information in a group setting. In
Malawi, however, local researchers advised that clients would feel more
comfortable sharing personal information in an FGD than in individual
interviews because they would know in a group setting that others were
also sharing such information; thus, the risk of social desirability bias
would be reduced (
Elrofaie, 2020)
Study design and data collection
The qualitative data presented here are taken from three FGDs with
turned-away clients conducted three to six months after turnaway. The
number of FGDs was constrained by cost and feasibility. The turned-
away clients came from two districts in Malawi, Kasungu and Zomba.
The team intended to include six to eight participants per FGD, but in
two cases, five participants attended. Discussions took place in a private
space at available primary school classrooms in each district in late
March and early April 2020. Clients participating in FGDs were
compensated 7,000 Malawian kwachas, or approximately US$IO, for
their time, as required by the Malawian institutional review board, the
National Health Sciences Research Committee (NHSRC). Although
COVID-19 had not yet been detected in Malawi at the time of the FGDs,
rates were rising throughout the world. To accommodate social
distancing in their transportation to and from the FGDs, participants
were offered transportation reimbursement and encouraged to use
transportation that could best ensure social distancing (motorcycle taxi
in place of minibus, for example). Those needing reimbursement for
transportation received US$2—US$15, depending on the distance trav-
elled and means of transportation used.
The data collection team consisted of a lead interviewer and a note-
taker, both Malawian women with bachelor's degrees in relevant fields
and previous experience with qualitative data collection in health-
related studies. Both had participated in the quantitative portion of
the study and were familiar with the research goals and objectives. Prior
to initiating the FGDs, they received an additional two days of training
on qualitative data collection, including modules on key components of
effective facilitation, such as not interrupting respondents, not making
assumptions about what participants will say, and clarifying points that
are unclear.
During the FGD, the interviewer used a semi-structured, open-ended
discussion guide to lead the participants through predetermined ques-
tions and topics. The research team developed the discussion guide after
analysis of the turnaway and follow-up survey data. The aim was to gain
a deeper understanding of those results by allowing the women to ex-
press their views on their FP visits. The broad topics included experi-
ences with and reasons for turnaway, perceptions of the quality of the
services they had received (including their understanding of why they
had been turned away), what clients do as a result of being turned away,
and subsequent outcomes after turnaway. The FGDs were conducted in
Chichewa.
Data management and analysis
FGDs were audio recorded and transcribed directly into English by
the lead interviewer; transcriptions were reviewed by the note-taker
present at the FGDs. Transcriptions included bracketed notes from the
transcriber/lead interviewer to add context to comments where neces-
sary. Further context was provided by Malawian members of the
research team to its non-Malawian members.
We used grounded theory to analyse the transcripts, first by open-
Midwifery 129 (2024) 103825
coding to find similarities and differences in results, then using axial
coding to establish connections between categories and subcategories,
and finally, selective coding to establish core categories, themes, and the
grounded theory (
). While we expected some topics to
Priest et al., 2002
overlap with what we had found in the quantitative surveys regarding
reasons for turnaway, we chose to use a grounded theory framework to
allow for new categories to emerge and to capture nuances in how cli-
ents might describe the reasons for turnaway and other topics explored.
We allowed themes to develop across questions rather than simply
quantifying responses to particular questions.
The transcripts were imported into NVivo (QSR International Pty
Ltd., 2018
) for analysis. We performed inter-coder agreement checks
with two coders and discussed any discrepancies until we reached
agreement. Demographic information for the FGD participants was
based on follow-up surveys conducted six and 12 weeks post turnaway.
Specific comments made during FGDs were not linked to the de-
mographic details given at the time of the initial survey.
Ethics
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by FHI 360's Pro-
tection of Human Subjects Committee in Durham, NC, USA, as well as
the National Health Science Research Committee in Malawi. All study
staff completed training on research ethics, the protocol, and informed
consent administration. All participants provided their written informed
consent to participate.
Results
Three FGDs were held—two in Kasungu District with five partici-
pants each and one in Zomba District with six participants—for a total of
16. Participant quotes are presented verbatim with minimal editing for
clarity.
Participant background and demographic data
Demographic data for FGD participants were collected during the
exit survey conducted at the facility the day they were turned away and
was available for 15 of the 16 participants. The participants were on
average age 26.3 years (range 19—42). All but one was married, and all
had given birth at least once, including eight who had given birth within
six months of the day we first spoke to them. Nine had a primary school
education, and six had a secondary school education. One of the par-
ticipants reported on the six-week survey that her partner disapproved
of her use of FP; the others reported their partners had approved FP use.
Based on the six-week post-turnaway survey, eight of the FGD partici-
pants were able to start a method by that time, and three more were able
to start by 12 weeks post-turnaway.
Reasons for 'turnaway'
After establishing the meaning of the term 'turnaway' with FGD
participants as leaving a health facility without a method of FP on the
day a client wanted one, facilitators asked about why clients get turned
away. Using thematic analysis as a part of our grounded theory frame-
work, we classified the reasons for turnaway most discussed into eight
categories (Table 1). All were mentioned in two or more FGDs.
No proof of not being pregnant
Women discussed being turned away when they could not demon-
strate they were not pregnant. If a woman had missed a period, or came
in between periods, health workers asked her to come back after taking a
pregnancy test or while she was menstruating. In some cases, not
menstruating was mentioned in the context of initiating a new method,
but in many cases the participants were referring to clients coming for a
reinjection. Participants noted this was particularly unfair for women

who missed a reinjection date by just a few days, given that missing
periods while using injectable contraception is common.
If the day you were appointed to come for FP and you did not come
and go the following day, they turn you away so that you get a
pregnancy test first, so they see evidence that you are eligible to
access FP (FGD-03-05).
If a woman has gone after the appointed date has passed, she is told
to come back when she is menstruating. It's not right because some
methods make some women not to menstruate ... For example, Depo
[injectable], most people stop menstruating when they are using this
method, and yet the providers want you to menstruate first as proof
that you are not pregnant. This is not right (FGD-02-02).
Method and/or supply stock-outs
Facilities can run out of methods or the supplies needed to initiate a
method, such as the trocar needed to insert a contraceptive implant.
Known as 'stock-outs', this reason for turnaway was frequently
mentioned by FGD participants. Specifically noted by the participants
were stock-outs of injectables, implants, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and
insertion materials. In some cases, participants said that during a stock-
Midwifery 129 (2024) 103825
out the providers would give them advice on where else they could go to
get the method or a future date when the method should be back in
supply. Some women also mentioned being advised to use pills or con-
doms while waiting for injectables to be available, but other women
reported that they had not been offered any backup methods and had
simply been turned away. One participant gave an example of the
consequences of stock-outs:
Sometimes they know that we are going to get our children checked
by the scale [at the under-five growth monitoring clinic], but the
stock is little, like for Depo [injectable], to cater for all of us. They
communicate when we should come back, but while waiting some
women end up pregnant (FGD-03-05).
Participants found it disappointing to be turned away for method or
supply stock-outs but understood this reason for turnaway when all
women seeking that method were turned away.
Arriving late
Participants explained that they can get turned away when there are
too many clients for providers to see by a certain time. In one example, a
participant reported that providers will see clients up until 2pm, but any
clients still waiting at that time are asked to come back another day. In
other cases, clients who arrive late to the facility are turned away upon
arrival. 'Like for [Health Centre], they open at 8 0'clock, so if you are
late beyond 11 0'clock, they send us away,' one client explained (FGD-
03-04).
Another participant tried to access two services on one day, making
her late for FP services:
The second time [I was turned away] they said that I came in late.
That day I was also weighing my child [at the under-five growth
monitoring clinic]. When I explained, they said that I should only
come for one thing (FGD-03-02).
Being turned away for these reasons was frustrating for clients who
came long distances and preferred to receive more than one service in a
single trip to a facility, but other participants saw it as fair.
Provider unavailable
Providers must not only be present but also trained in all methods.
Participants described being asked to return on a different day when the
provider trained to supply a particular method was not present on the
day they were seeking it. 'For example, if you want the method placed in
the arm, the providers know that the person responsible to insert the
method is not around, they advise that you come the following day when
the specific provider comes around' (FGD-03-05).
Another client shared another example of a difficult-to-understand
reason for turnaway:
Like when you go and you know that you don't react well to Depo,
and you want to collect pills, they tell you that 'we have no pills,' or
the person responsible to supply pills is not there. You end up
disappointed because the pills are needed every day (FGD-03-02).
Clients also discussed that providers may get pulled in to work with
other clients, such as those in need of immediate care, leaving the FP-
service area temporarily without a provider. Although clients could
understand the need for FP providers to respond to emergency circum-
stances, they found this disappointing and frustrating.
Provider refusal. Participants described situations in which providers
refused to give them a method. They had trouble understanding why
they should be turned away just because a provider was tired, or wanted
to take a lunch break, or had other responsibilities to tend to. One
participant said, 'The supplies may be available, but [the providers] will
say they are tired, and the clients won't get the methods' (FGD-OI-OI).
More frequently mentioned was refusal when a client showed up for
4


J.M. Peterson et al.
a reinjection, but not on the assigned day. One participant explained, 'FP
days at our facility is Tuesday and Thursday. If the appointment date
falls on a different day other than Tuesday or Thursday, we are turned
back. Sometimes we end up falling pregnant as a result of this' (FGD-02-
03).
In some cases that participants found frustrating, providers appeared
to be saving the requested method for particular women, such as those
who arrived in cars or who had 'personal connections' to the providers.
It also happens at our health facility that others access the same FP
methods you are going for, and yet we are turned away. Usually they
prefer well-to-do people: those that have come by car go straight in
the provider room and get assisted, while the rest of us are sent back.
Sometimes they judge us with the way we are looking or are dressed;
we are turned away without any assistance (FGD-02-01).
Needing to wait longer after delivery of a child. Some FGD participants
had been told they had come to initiate FP too soon after delivery.
'Sometimes they tell us that the baby is still young, so it is impossible to
get a method of FP before the baby reaches six weeks.' (FDG-03-01)
Participants said they had been told to wait until six weeks after the birth
of a child to initiate a method, without mentioning the method they had
been denied or if they had been offered a backup method, such as
progesterone-only pills or IUDS, which can be used immediately after
delivery.
Payment requested Despite methods being offered for free at public fa-
cilities, FGD participants noted several examples of providers asking for
payments from clients. Some participants mentioned providers selling
methods for a profit or needing to be 'connected' to a provider to receive
methods that are in short supply. One participant said, 'It happens that
sometimes that some [providers] are selling the family planning
methods, so maybe money is hard to find, so we fail to access FP. ' (FGD-
03-01). Another said:
The providers share amongst themselves. We go to the facilities, and
they tell us that there is a stock-out, but the same provider will tell
you that the same method he has at home. So, I was wondering why
the FP services are found in their homes and not at the health facility.
I did not go to their house to get a method. (FGD-02-01)
Yet another participant mentioned making payments. When asked to
clarify if the payment was for all services or particular services, she
explained:
It's mostly the method one is looking for, to help build another
hospital. Like when I went there, they said we should pay 200
kwachas, and then the person handling the records suggested that we
pay more the next time we go, like add 300 kwachas so that each one
should contribute 500 kwachas [approximately USD 0.60] in total
(FGD-02-04).
Participants expressed frustration in these cases and did not under-
stand why they should have to pay for methods that should be available
for free. They reported refusing to pay and instead going without FP
until it could be obtained for free.
Medical reasons. Women also discussed medical reasons for being
turned away, including showing up before a scheduled resupply or
reinjection date, anaemia, high blood pressure, and risk of blood clots.
One participant said, 'For me, when I was getting a removal, they denied
me another method because I was told I have anaemia, and so I was told
to wait for three months to observe the situation' (FGD-03-03).
Participants understood that for medical reasons, some methods
were incompatible with some women.
Midwifery 129 (2024) 103825
What do clients do when turned away?
Participants mentioned several approaches they take to cope when
turned away. Most frequently mentioned was sleeping apart from their
husbands to abstain from sexual relations. This was preferred to 'eating
sweets still in their wrappers,' the local saying used to describe having
sex with condoms. But women also mentioned the failure to obtain a
contraceptive method leading to quarrels with their husbands, who
sometimes felt their wives had deliberately failed to get a method
because they wanted more children.
Other coping mechanisms discussed were returning to the facility on
a different day, seeking FP through an outreach service, and accepting a
second-choice method in place of the one they preferred. Accepting an
alternate method was usually noted in conjunction with a second or
third turnaway. Going to an HSA who is a paid and trained community
health worker, a traditional healer, or an assistant at a private facility,
were also mentioned. One participant said there was nothing she could
do because other facilities did not exist in her area. Several noted the
stress of the situation. One participant said, 'You get stressed when
turned away. You go everywhere. You ask friends, neighbours, and HSAs
for help' (FGD-03-06).
Participants in all three of the groups discussed the advantages of
going to private facilities when they can afford it, because at private
facilities all methods are in stock and available. They tried other facil-
ities—either public or private—when they felt they had not been treated
well by a provider or thought they had a better chance of accessing a
preferred method.
I didn't take long before I sought a method. I knew that my husband
sleeping alone was not a good idea, so I tried hard to visit [the Dis-
trict Hospital] to look for my method, and so I got it a week later
(FGD-OI-OI).
Participants said they did not return to any facility when they were
geographically isolated and/or had to pay large amounts for transport to
a facility. 'Sometimes the transportation is tricky. You see that you
travelled a long distance only to be turned away. So, you start
contemplating on not going [back] for fear of experiencing a similar
predicament' (FGD-01-06).
Finally, unwanted pregnancies were noted as an unfair consequence
of turnaway. 'Sometimes you go to access FP methods, and you are not
assisted, it leads to an unexpected pregnancy, so this is hurtful.' (FGD-
03-06). As described by another participant, 'It's not right to be turned
away, because if we get turned way there are high chances of us getting
pregnant and we will be giving birth frequently' (FGD-OI-OI).
Multiple turnaways are common
Participants in the focus groups described being turned away one to
three times in relation to the time we first met them. Many went back in
the week following the initial turnaway and were then able to initiate a
method. But for others, it was more difficult. One participant said, 'The
first time I was turned away was in December due to a holiday. The
second time they told me there was a stock-out of sterilizing materials. I
got a method on my third try' (FGD-03-03).
Another participant looking for an implant explained, 'After being
turned away from [my local] health centre, I went to another hospital,
but I didn't find it again, and then I found [an outreach service], and
that's where 1 got it' (FGD-02-05).
One participant spoke of finding implants stocked out twice, and
then the materials for inserting implants were unavailable, so she finally
agreed to an injectable instead. Another participant said after two un-
successful attempts at her local public facility, she visited a private fa-
cility and was able to initiate her chosen method.

Perceived quality of services
When asked about providers during the FGDs, participants expressed
several concerns about the quality of the services provided. For example,
participants mentioned that providers do not always take the time to
explain methods and can treat clients poorly when they are in a hurry.
'Like when they want to inject us with Depo, they do not consider that
we are in pain, they just bring in many people and inject us in a hurry,
then we go back home we start swelling up' (FGD-02-03).
Clients said sometimes there are not enough staff, and providers get
tired. One participant suggested that providers be rotated among facil-
ities. 'We need to reshuffle the providers because the ones we have now
are used to us and don't respect us anymore' (FGD-02-03). Participants
also reported that providers can be 'mean' and 'shout at us.'
Some participants provided positive feedback related to providers
giving them comprehensive information on all methods and helping
them find the right one for their circumstances. One participant recog-
nised that providers give better information than friends do.
The problem that I noticed amongst women is that we listen to our
friends, we find out they are complaining about FP services, and we
take it from them that there is no help we can get from the providers.
We get easily discouraged, but if we could take the initiative to hear
from the providers themselves, I believe it would help us all (FGD-02-
01).
Discussion
This qualitative research presents womenS experiences with, and
perceptions of, turnaway from receiving a method of FP in two districts
in Malawi. Nearly all the reasons described for being turned away were
medically incorrect, preventable, and potentially harmful to women
seeking FP. Clients described how not receiving FP on time—either new
methods or resupplies—was stressful for them and had real implications.
Whether clients had to return to search for methods another day, refrain
from sexual relations, or adopt a second-choice method, it caused them
worry and inconvenience. Although none of our participants mentioned
being pregnant at the time of the FGDs, they discussed it as a possibility.
Three additional reasons for turnaway were mentioned by women in
the FGDs that were not seen in the survey results (Peterson et al., 2022a
include provider refusal, charging of informal fees and late arrival
). Provider refusal included providers being tired or needing a
(Table 1
break or giving preferential services for women assumed to be 'well--
to-do. ' Providers charging informal fees—another category of turnaway
not seen in survey results—and preferential treatment have been seen
before, for example, in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Sierra Leone, and
Malawi (
Busse et al., 2022; Tumlinson et al., 2013; Tumlinson et al.,
2021; Hunt, 2010; Pieterse and Lodge, 2015; Mamba et al., 2017)
Identifying these barriers in interviews with the women seeking the
services, but not in the survey, illustrates the importance of applying
multiple research methods in exploring care-seeking behaviour and its
outcome. These practices raise issues of inequity of access to FP based on
socioeconomic status or personal connections to providers and should be
studied further to design and implement interventions to prevent them.
Late arrival, the third new category of reasons for turnaway
mentioned during the FGDs, could be another aspect of inequity in
service delivery resulting from financial status—women who cannot
afford to use transportation methods such as mini-buses, taxis, or bicycle
taxis might be more likely to arrive late. Women who live further from
facilities may also find it more difficult to arrive at a facility early in the
morning. The impact of these potential inequities should be considered
when formal or informal policies on the availability of FP services based
on the day of the week or time of arrival at the facility are implemented
High Impact Practices in Family Planning (HIPs) Partnership, 2021,
Stratton et al., 2021)
The women frequently mentioned the need to be currently
Midwifery 129 (2024) 103825
menstruating to receive a method. In the era of cheap, accurate preg-
nancy tests (estimated to cost a facility US$O.08—US$O.25 each in
Malawi in 2016), this requirement seems unnecessary (Kolesar et al.,
). Also, Malawian providers' pre-service training materials include
2017
the option for providers to rule out pregnancy in many cases through the
use of the Reasonably Sure Not Pregnant Checklist (
Kolesar et al., 2017,
). Although
Ministry of Health and IntraHealth International, 2010
providers usually do not control whether a pregnancy test is available at
a facility, they could use this checklist more frequently to rule out
pregnancy (Peterson et al., 2022b). For the women, needing to come to a
facility when menstruating is both costly and inconvenient and presents
extra challenges and added stress (Peterson et al., 2022a). At the same
time, the providers are navigating the dilemma of potentially initiating a
method to a pregnant woman against preventing a loss in confidence in
the effectiveness of modern FP methods.
In the FGDs, the women felt especially frustrated being scheduled for
re-injection of injectable contraception on a non-FP day, refused that
day, and then denied a re-injection again for coming in a day or two late,
on the closest FP day to their scheduled appointments. Officially,
Malawi follows the World Health Organization's medical eligibility
criteria, which state that women can come up to two weeks before or
four weeks after a scheduled appointment date to receive a re-injection,
but this does not appear to happen consistently in practice (Ministry of
Health and IntraHealth International, 2010). As noted by one partici-
pant, asking women who are current users of injectables to wait until
they begin menstruating again seems unreasonable, especially given
that this can take several months (
DEPO-PROVERA- medrox-
yprogesterone acetate injection spi, 2020). Providing FP services daily is
in line with MOHP expectations and is reasonable, particularly for
re-injections, which require little time for counselling.
Stock-outs of supplies and methods lead to turnaway but are nor-
mally out of the control of individual providers. A worldwide shortage of
injectable contraception in 2019, due to the shutdown of a manufacturer
sterilizing facility (U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2019
), likely
affected the supply of injectables in Malawi during our research. In
addition, ordering and delivering commodities is a complex process
involving a host of players, including pharmacy technicians, FP co-
ordinators working for the Reproductive Health Unit in the MOHP, the
MOHP Health Technical Services and Support Unit, and the Central
Medical Stores Trust, which is responsible for procurement (
Govern-
ment of Malawi, 2015). This system has been noted to lack account-
ability, perhaps allowing individual providers to sell methods on the side
Government of Malawi, 2015)—an issue raised by the women. These
findings are in line with other research in Malawi showing the 'leakage'
of essential drugs from official health facility stocks, as well as the fre-
quency with which others have seen official drugs being sold through
unofficial channels (Carlson et al., 2014; Msoma et al., 2020
). Conse-
quently, to effectively limit turnaway of women seeking FP and support
the providers, better control around essential drugs is crucial.
The FGD highlighted turnaway resulting from having too few pro-
viders or providers not trained on all methods. Low caregiver-to-patient
ratios are seen throughout sub-Saharan Africa, including in Malawi,
where there are just seven nurses or midwives per 10,000 people (World
Health Organization, 2022a). Providers in Malawi have expressed
frustration with being short staffed or not having staff trained in all
methods (Peterson et al., 2022a; Mwafulirwa et al., 2016; Haraldsdöttir
). Overworked providers grow weary and frustrated when
et al., 2021
they cannot keep up with their workloads or do not have the supplies
and training needed to do so. Yet, lashing out at clients or treating them
in a rude and disrespectful manner, as described in the FGDs, and re-
ported elsewhere (Tumlinson et al., 2013; Nalwadda et al., 2010;
Mannava et al., 2015) is unacceptable. Furthermore, providers should
not partake in selective practices, with women who appear to be
financially advantaged having better access to services and methods
than those judged to be poorer, as was described in the FGD.
Stock-outs and staffing issues, including training on all methods as
6


J.M. Peterson et al.
well as client eligibility, are systemic challenges that should be
addressed by the MOHP and district authorities. For example, providers
should know that clients should be able to receive progesterone-only
pills any time after delivery and that an IUD can be inserted within 48
hours of delivery or after four weeks, as well as the medical eligibility
criteria for reinjections of injectable contraception (Ministry of Health
and IntraHealth International, 2010). Efforts should also be made at a
systemic level to eliminate the occurrence of providers privately selling
methods acquired through unofficial channels or giving preferential
treatment to some clients. Providing turned-away clients with alterna-
tive options, such as referrals to other means of initiating FP (through
outreach facilities or HSAs), and talking to them consistently about
second-choice methods are other practical steps that can be taken to
ensure the FP needs of women in Malawi are met in a timely manner.
In this study, Malawian women draw attention to their experiences
of being turned away when seeking FP. Most of the reasons they high-
light are preventable, indicating that these barriers can be removed if
there is a will for systemic changes and if providers adopt a client-
centred approach that enables easy access to the methods of contra-
ception Malawian women need and are entitled to receive. If these
barriers are addressed while giving due attention to the provider per-
spectives (Peterson et al., 2022a), policymakers and program imple-
menters will be able to reduce FP turnaway, not only in Malawi but with
potential implications elsewhere.
A strength of this study is that it provides information on an
understudied area—the impact of client turnaway on women and their
families in their own words. The study is unique because it recruited
women who had been followed longitudinally to understand their ex-
periences with and the outcomes of turnaway. Another strength of the
research is the diversity of the research team. The composition of the
team, which included men and women, Malawians and non-Malawians,
and a generational spread, allowed us to reflect on how these and other
characteristics may have influenced the research and to attempt to
mitigate any personal interference in how the participant voices were
heard and understood. Nonetheless, the sample was limited to clients
with access to a mobile phone who were willing to be contacted—two
factors that could bias the results. The number of FGDs is another lim-
itation; the research struggled with sample size because it started just as
the COVID-19 pandemic began, when people were becoming wary of
going out or gathering with others. Given that most of the reasons for
turnaway were discussed in multiple FGDs, however, we consider the
results a reliable representation of the range of reasons why women have
been turned away.
Conclusions
Clients are turned away without a method of FP on the day they seek
one for multiple reasons, nearly all of which are preventable. Many ex-
amples given by the participants showed a lack ofknowledge and respect
for clients on the part of the providers. At the same time, the practical
constraints experienced by the providers can not be underestimated and
need to be simultaneously addressed. Thus, health policymakers aiming
to improve FP services need to consider the perspectives of the FP pro-
viders as well as those of the clients, as presented here.
Ensuring providers have a client-centred attitude and improving
their morale, motivation, and practices could improve client-provider
interactions. Changing attitudes and behaviour, however, may be diffi-
cult and will require additional steps, such as additional training and
oversight. In addition, increasing the availability and use of pregnancy
tests, having a more reliable supply of methods and materials, increasing
the number of providers—including those trained well in all method-
s—and providing daily FP services would all help reduce turnaway.
Enabling all medically eligible women who are seeking a method of FP
to obtain one the day it is first sought will help Malawi and other low-
and middle-income countries achieve their SDGs in women and chil-
dren's health and beyond.

Abstract
Background and objective: A significant proportion of women of childbearing age have psoria-
sis. The aim of this study was to examine family planning concerns in this population.
Material and methods: Observational, descriptive, cross-sectional, multicenter study con-
ducted between March 2020 and October 2021. We collected sociodemographic data and
analyzed responses to a family planning questionnaire administered to women aged 18 to
45 years with plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic treatment.

Introduction
ACTAS Dermo-Sifiliogråficas 115 (2024) TIO-T20
Results: We studied 153 patients (mean [SD] age, 35.4[8.0] years; mean disease duration, 16.7
years) being treated at 11 Spanish hospitals. Overall, 38.4% of women were considered to have
moderate to severe psoriasis by their physicians; perceived severity ratings were significantly
higher among women. Psoriasis affected the women's desire to become pregnant or led to
their delaying pregnancy in 1 in 3 respondents. They were concerned that their condition might
worsen if they had to discontinue or switch treatment or that the treatment might harm the
baby. Approximately half of the women had not received family planning counseling from their
physicians, and this was more likely to be the case among never-pregnant women. Women on
biologic therapy (58.7%) had better psoriasis control and a better quality of life than women
on other treatments. Their sexual health was also less affected.
Conclusions: Women with psoriasis have numerous family planning concerns, which in some
cases can lead them to delay pregnancy or affect their desire to become pregnant. Dermatolo-
gists need to receive better training regarding family planning in women with psoriasis so that
they can provide their patients with more and better information.

Percepciön de la mujer con psoriasis en la planificaciön familiar: estudio descriptivo,
transversal y multicéntrico
Resumen
Antecedentes y objetivos: La psoriasis afecta a un gran porcentaje de mujeres en edad fértil.
Nuestro objetivo fue conocer las inquietudes de las mujeres con psoriasis en relaci6n con la
planificaciån familiar.
Material y métodos: Estudio observacional, descriptivo, transversal y multicéntrico realizado
entre marzo del 2020 y octubre del 2021. Se recabaron datos sociodemogråficos e inquietudes
relacionadas con la planificaci6n familiar de mujeres entre 18-45 ahos con psoriasis en placas
y candidatas a recibir tratamiento sistémico.
Resultados: Se reclutaron 153 pacientes de 11 centros espaholes (edad media: 35,4 ± 8 ahos,
duraci6n media de Ia enfermedad: 16,7 ahos); 38,4% de los casos tenian una enfermedad
moderada/grave para los médicos, aunque la percepciån de la actividad era significativamente
superior para las pacientes. En una de cada tres mujeres, la enfermedad limitaba o retrasaba el
deseo gestacional. Existia preocupaciön de que la enfermedad empeorara al tener que retirar o
cambiar un fårmaco o que los tratamientos perjudicaran al bebé. Alrededor de la mitad de las
pacientes no habia recibido informaciån sobre planificaciån familiar en la consulta, especial-
mente aquellas mujeres sin embarazos previos. Las mujeres con tratamiento bi016gico (58, 7%)
tenian mejor situaciån clinica, mejor calidad de vida y menos alteraciones en la esfera sexual
que las pacientes sin tratamiento bi016gico.
Conclusiones: Las pacientes con psoriasis tienen numerosas preocupaciones relacionadas con
la planificaciön familiar. En algunos casos, estos miedos podrian Ilevar a retrasar y/o limitar
el deseo gestacional. Seria necesario incrementar la informaciön que se da a las pacientes y
mejorar la formaciån de los dermatålogos en este tema.

Psoriasis has a negative effect on patients' quality of life.
In Spain, the prevalence of psoriasis is 2.3%, affecting appro-
ximately 1 million persons, with little variation between the
sexes.2 Onset is between the second and fourth decades
of life in 75% of cases, that is, coinciding with a woman's
reproductive years, causing concern and uncertainty with
respect to childbearing3 4 owing to the lack of information on
family planning, pregnancy, and breastfeeding.5 6 According
to the BIOBADADERM registry, women with moderate-to-
7
severe psoriasis in Spain are less likely to become pregnant
8
and breastfeed than the general population.
The course of psoriasis during pregnancy is unpre-
dictable. Symptoms improve in around half of pregnant
women, remain unchanged in others, and worsen in more
than 20%.3 Moreover, symptoms worsen after delivery in
65%.9 Uncontrolled psoriasis during pregnancy is associated
3,10-12
with complications for both mother and fetus.
While
13-15
many psoriasis treatments are potentially teratogenic,
current therapeutic options are compatible with pregnancy
5,16-18
and breastfeeding.
The main objectives of the present
study were as follows: to determine the impact of psoriasis
on the desire to become pregnant and on breastfeeding; to
learn more about the concerns and fears of women with the
disease before, during, and after pregnancy; and to analyze
Til

the information on family planning, pregnancy, and breast-
feeding they receive at the clinic with the aim of ensuring
that the information provided by their dermatologist is as
complete and exhaustive as possible depending on their indi-
vidual needs. The secondary objectives were to evaluate
differences in the impact of the disease, concerns and infor-
mation depending on whether the woman had been pregnant
or had a child, treatment with biologics, and disease activity
according to the patient or to the physician.
Methods
We performed a multicenter, cross-sectional, descriptive,
observational study. Patients were selected during visits to
the dermatologist at Spanish clinics and included between
March 2020 and October 2021.
Study Population
The study population comprised women with plaque pso-
riasis aged 18-45 years who were candidates for systemic
treatment and who agreed to participate in the study. We
excluded patients with psoriatic arthritis (to focus on the
skin and minimize variability), patients who did not wish to
participate, and patients who were not sufficiently literate
to participate.
Variables and Data Collection
We collected clinical variables, including the Psoriasis Area
Severity Index (PASI), Body Surface Area (BSA), perceived
activity of psoriasis by the physician on a visual analog scale
(VAS, 0-10), comorbid conditions, and previous and current
treatment. Quality of life was evaluated using a qualitative
scale (
Supplementary material) and the Dermatology Life
19
Quality Index (DLQI).
Patients responded anonymously with their sociode-
mographic data and their perception of the activity of
their psoriasis on a hard-copy questionnaire. The ques-
tionnaire comprised 27 items addressing family planning
and was specifically designed for the study (Supplementary
material). The investigators drafted the questionnaire ad
hoc for this project taking into account the study objec-
tives. Items 1-16 and 24 addressed concerns and information
before pregnancy and the impact of the disease. Item 2
evaluated the impact of the disease on the patient's sexual
health. Items 17-21 addressed concerns and information
during pregnancy, and items 22, 23, and 25 addressed these
areas after pregnancy. The remaining 2 items assessed
information provided by the physician and other media.
The results were used to prepare a table covering areas
to address during visits.

(IQR). Subanalyses were performed for the secondary objec-
tives to evaluate differences due to having had children,
disease activity (mild, 0-2 on the VAS; moderate-to-severe,
3-10 on the VAS), and current use of biologics. Qualitative
variables were compared using the X2 test, and indepen-
dent or paired quantitative variables were compared using
the Mann-Whitney or Wilcoxon test, respectively. Statistical
significance was set at P< .05. The analysis was performed
using SPSS Version 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).
Ethics
The Declaration of Helsinki and Spanish legislation on
clinical research and data protection were adhered
to. The participants signed the informed consent document.
The study was approved by the Clinical Investigation Ethics
Committee of Hospital Ram6n y Cajal (Code, No. 373).
Results
We included 153 women from 11 Spanish centers (mean [SD]
age, 35.4 [8] years).
Table 1
summarizes the sociodemo-
graphic and clinical characteristics. Most patients (51.6%)
had never been pregnant. Of the 74 patients who had been
pregnant, most had had 1 or 2 children (51.4 and 27%,
respectively), and 35.1% had had at least 1 spontaneous
abortion; 23.9% had received care in high-risk pregnancy
units.
The median (IQR) disease duration was 16 years (9-22
years; minimum, 1 year; maximum, 41 years). Most patients
had mild disease at the time of the evaluation (BSA< 5%,
81.4%). However, severity was perceived as moderate-to-
severe (mean VAS, 3-10) by 49% of patients and 38.4%
of physicians. Perception of disease activity according to
the VAS value was significantly poorer among patients than
among physicians (mean VAS, 3.6 vs. 2.7; median 2 vs. 1.5;
P< .001). As for quality of life, 41 .2% reported this to be
moderate or very or extremely affected (Table 1 )
The results of the family planning questionnaire are
shown in Figures 1, 2, and 3.
With respect to the impact of psoriasis, more than 30%
of the patients somewhat agreed or very much agreed with
the statement that the disease can affect their sexual health
(item 2). For 35%, psoriasis affected their desire to become
pregnant or delayed their becoming pregnant (items 6-7);
20.5% felt that the disease could restrict them from caring
for their child appropriately (item 24).
As for concerns, 55%-65% were worried that their psoriasis
would worsen if the drug was withdrawn or switched before
pregnancy, during pregnancy, or during breastfeeding (items
15, 19, and 23). Around 60% were concerned that treatment
could harm the baby (item 21).
More than half of the patients thought that the informa-
tion received at visits did not address topics such as family
planning, desire to become pregnant, or treatment before
becoming pregnant (items 11-13). One third considered that
they knew which drugs they could and could not take before
pregnancy (item 14). Around 60% were aware that psori-
asis must be under control before and during pregnancy
(items 16-17). A significant proportion of patients had not
received information on available options during pregnancy
and breastfeeding (items 18 and 22). Almost half of the
patients somewhat or very much agreed that if they could
receive more information from their doctor, they would
reconsider becoming pregnant.
Analysis According to Whether the Patient Had
Been Pregnant or Had a Child
No statistical differences in disease activity were found
between women who had been pregnant/had a child and
those who had not according to the PASI or BSA. The same
was true for quality of life according to the DLQI. The disease
was perceived as being more active by patients than physi-
cians both in the case of women who had been pregnant/had
a child (mean VAS value, 4.2 vs. 3.1; P= .001) and in the case
of those who had not (mean VAS value, 3.1 vs. 2.3; P= .002).
Statistically significant differences were found between
patients who had been pregnant/had children and those
who had not for 9 items on the family planning question-
naire (Table 2). The differences point to less information on
family planning for patients who had not been pregnant/had
children (item 11) and on the safety of treatment before
pregnancy, during pregnancy, or during breastfeeding (items
14, 20, and 25) (Table 2)
Analysis According to Whether the Patient Was
Receiving Biologics
The disease was perceived as being more active by the
patient than the physician both in the case of patients who
had received biologics (mean VAS value, 2.6 vs. 1.9; P= .009)
and in those who had not (VAS value, 5.3 vs. 3.9; P< .001).
Values for perception of disease activity by the patient
and physician, together with severity according to PASI and
BSA, were statistically significantly lower among patients
who had received biologics (Table 3). Quality of life by DLQI
was significantly better in patients who received biologics.
In qualitative terms too, quality of life was better among
patients who received biologics (
Table 3)
Statistically significant differences were found for 3 items
on the family planning questionnaire (Table 4). Patients who
did not receive biologics reported a greater effect on their
sexual health (item 2) and a greater need to search for
external information (item 27) (Table 4)
Analysis According to Activity of Psoriasis: Patient
Values for PASI and BSA were statistically significantly
lower among patients who perceived activity as mild than
among those who perceived it as moderate-intense (mean
PASI, 1.5 vs. 4.8 points; P< .001; mean BSA, 1.0 vs. 4.9
points; P< .001). Quality of life was better among patients
who perceived activity as mild (mean DLQI, 3.4 vs. 9.9;
P< .001). The only differences found with respect to the
family planning questionnaire concerned the impact of
the disease on sexual health (item 2), with higher values
reported for patients with moderate-intense disease than
for those with mild disease (46 vs. 24%, respectively).

Analysis According to Activity of Psoriasis:
Physician
Values for PASI and BSA were statistically significantly lower
among patients with mild activity than among those with
moderate-intense activity (mean PASI, 1.4 vs. 5.9; P< .001;
mean BSA, 0.8 vs. 6.5; P< .001). Mean quality of life was
better in patients with mild disease (mean DLQI, 4.4 vs. 10;
P< .001). No significant differences were recorded for any
item in the family planning questionnaire.
Discussion
Recent studies indicate that women with moderate-
to-severe psoriasis in Spain are less likely to become
pregnant7 and less given to breastfeeding than the general
population.8 The underlying reasons for this finding include
psychological causes, feelings of low self-esteem, stigma-
tization, and a loss of confidence that leads to sexual
problems, social and family-related problems, and concern
over the effects of treatment on the fetus. 78 Our survey
showed that more than 40% of patients believed that if
they received more information from their physician, they
would reconsider the desire to have children. Therefore,
in line with a recent consensus statement, I we think
that physicians should be more proactive in providing this
information (
Table 5)
Psoriasis in women is diagnosed at a mean age of 28 years,
with initiation of treatment at 28-45 years, that is, when
reproductive activity is highest.5 In our study, the mean age
was 35.4 years, and the disease had been progressing for
16.7 years; therefore, our study population is representative
of women during their peak reproductive period. Psoria-
sis has a considerable physical and emotional impact on
women, affects their quality of life (to a greater extent than
it does that of men), affects their sexual relations, and gen-
erates uncertainty over the possible effects of the disease on
motherhood.3 5
Little is known about these aspects, which
may be undervalued in clinical practice.
Our cohort brings together patients with a significant
disease burden. The impact of the disease reduces the
desire to become pregnant or delays pregnancy in one third
of patients. The survey revealed some of the concerns
that could account for these fears, which are associated
mainly with the safety of treatment, the course of the
disease, and the lack of information. Most women are wor-
ried that the treatment could harm the baby, although
they are also concerned that the disease could worsen by
stopping or changing treatment before pregnancy, during
pregnancy, or during breastfeeding.
The data suggest that the information provided in the
dermatology clinic on family planning, desire to become
pregnant, and safety of treatment is insufficient, both
before conception and during pregnancy and breastfeeding,
especially in women who have not previously been preg-
nant. We think that all women of reproductive age should
receive appropriate information at the clinic. Moreover, up
to 50% of pregnancies are not planned; therefore, in line
with other authors,5 we believe that women of reproduc-
tive age should be provided with a treatment plan that is
compatible with pregnancy, irrespective of their intentions
with respect to family planning. Furthermore, it is important
to train and improve the role of dermatologists as providers
of information on family planning.
Our results suggest that women taking biologics are fol-
lowed up more appropriately and have a better quality
of life, with less impact of the disease on sexual health,
than patients not taking biologics. Treatment of psoriasis

Points Associated With Family Planning to Be Addressed at the Clinic.a
Before becoming pregnant
• Psoriasis-related problems affecting
sexual health
• Delaying pregnancy or affecting
desire to become pregnant owing
to psoriasis or its treatments
• Need for the disease to be
controlled before becoming
pregnant
• Treatments to avoid before
becoming pregnant
Associated with pregnancy
• Need for the disease to be
controlled during pregnancy
• Concerns over the following:
Course of psoriasis during
pregnancy
Course of psoriasis if treatment
is withdrawn
Maternal complications arising
from psoriasis or its treatment
Fetal complications arising from
psoriasis or its treatment
• Treatments to be avoided during
pregnancy
After delivery
• Course of psoriasis after
pregnancy
• Possibility of breastfeeding
• Concerns over whether children
will inherit psoriasis
• Concern over whether psoriasis
limits appropriate care of children
• Treatments to be avoided during
breastfeeding
aSourced from reliable information on family planning in women with psoriasis (e.g., information from scientific societies or patient
associations analyzed by specialists).
during pregnancy and breastfeeding is challenging for the
clinician.
While numerous therapies with potential ter-
13
atogenic effects must be withdrawn before conception,
some treatments can be used safely during pregnancy and
breastfeeding, and we should inform patients in this regard.
Certolizumab pegol is the safest biologic in both pregnancy
and breastfeeding, given that its passage across the pla-
centa to the mother's milk is minimal or nonexistent.
Pregnant women treated with biologics can continue treat-
ment during the first and second trimesters. The risks and
benefits of continuing treatment during the third trimester
can be discussed with the patient. However, patients tak-
ing certolizumab pegol can continue to do so throughout
their pregnancy, if considered clinically necessary, as well
13
as during breastfeeding.
20
It has been shown that in both healthy women
21
and in women with other chronic diseases,
attitude
toward pregnancy is influenced by perception of risk.22
Chronic diseases are associated with various risks dur-
ing pregnancy, and the perception of risk is unique to
each individual and not based only on objective information
with respect to the risk.20 Therefore, further research
is necessary to understand women's perception of risk
in specific chronic diseases. In addition, efforts must be
made to improve the information provided to patients on
objective risks.20
In the specific case of psoriasis, recent
13
guidelines address patient management.
Our study is limited by its cross-sectional, descriptive,
and observational design and the fact that it lacks a con-
trol group comprising women without psoriasis or male
patients with psoriasis. However, we believe that our sam-
ple is representative of women of reproductive age seen
at dermatology clinics in Spain, and who provide some
indication of their needs and concerns with respect to
family planning. Our findings lead us to believe that it is
essential to provide more information to patients at the
clinic.
Conclusions
The results of our study suggest that psoriasis has an impact
on family planning and desire to become pregnant. Various
concerns may affect a woman's desire to become preg-
nant or delay pregnancy. The information provided on these
aspects during follow-up is not complete.

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Medicaid family planning waivers can increase access to health care services and have been associated
with lower rates of unintended pregnancy, which are associated with a higher risk of negative birth outcomes such as
preterm birth and low birthweight. The objective of this study was to test the effect of Georgia's Medicaid family
planning waiver, Planning for Healthy Babies (P4HB), on pregnancy characteristics and birth outcomes.
Materials and Methods: We used the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey data in pre- (2008-
2009) and two post-periods (2012-2013; 2017-2019). We identified those likely eligible for P4HB in Georgia (n = 1,967) and
10 comparison states (n = 13,449) and tested for effects using state and year fixed effects difference-in-differences modeling.
Results: P4HB was associated with a 13.3 percentage-point (pp) decrease in unintended pregnancy in the immediate
post-period (p < .01) and an 11.4 pp decrease in the later post-period (p < .05). For the immediate post-period, P4HB
was also associated with a 29.2 pp increase in the probability of prepregnancy contraception (p < .001) and a 1.1 pp
decrease in the probability of a very low birthweight (VLBW) birth (p < .01 ). The reduction in VLBW birth was significant
for non-Hispanic Black mothers (—3.9 pp; p < .05) but not for mothers of other races/ethnicities.
Discussion: Medicaid family planning waivers are an important structural policy intervention that can improve repro-
ductive health care, particularly in states without Medicaid expansion. These waivers may also help address long-
standing racial/ethnic disparities in access to reproductive health care and, potentially, adverse pregnancy and birth
outcomes. However, the initial increase in pregnancies among people using contraception indicates that care must be
taken to ensure that recipients have access to effective methods of contraception and receive counseling on effective use
in order to avoid unintended consequences as more individuals try to prevent a pregnancy.

2019)—comprise approximately 45% of U.S. pregnancies (
Finer &
Zolna, 2016). Compared with planned births, unplanned births
may be associated with poorer outcomes, including increased
risk of preterm and low birthweight (Gipson et al., 2008; Hall
et al., 2017; Shah et al., 2011). Furthermore, the ability to
obtain and use effective contraception has been shown to
improve educational attainment (Ananat & Hungerman, 2012,
Bailey et al., 2012; Fletcher & Wolfe, 2009; Goldin & Katz, 2002,
Hock, 2007; Hofferth et al., 2001 ; Sonfield et al., 2013), workforce
participation (Bailey, 2006; Bailey et al., 2012; Edlund &
Machado, 2011 ; Jacobsen et al., 1999; Sonfield et al., 2013
), and
economic stability (Bailey et al., 2012; Blackburn et al., 1993
Chandler et al., 1994, Loughran & Zissimopoulos, 2009; Miller,
2011; Sonfield et al., 2013, Taniguchi, 1999), along with mental
and physical health outcomes (American Public Health
Association, 2015; Barber et al., 1999; Gipson et al., 2008,
Henretta et al., 2008; Mirowsky & Ross, 2002; Sonfield et al.,
2013).
Medicaid's Role in Family Planning
Among the 21 million low-income U.S. females of reproduc-
tive age in 2017, Medicaid was the leading single source of health
insurance, covering 44% (Ranji et al., 2019). Medicaid also funds
most U.S. publicly funded family planning services, accounting
for roughly 75% of the $2.1 billion in public family planning ex-
penditures in 2015 (Hasstedt et al., 2017). Since 1972, the federal
government has required state Medicaid programs to provide
family planning services to beneficiaries. To encourage increased
access to Medicaid family planning services, state spending is
matched at 90% and cost-sharing is prohibited (Guttmacher
Institute & Kaiser Family Foundation, 2007; Walls et al., 2016).
Beginning in the mid-1990s, states began applying for Section
1115 demonstration waivers—time-limited demonstration pro-
jects to improve the design and implementation of state
Medicaid programs—from the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services (CMS) in an effort to provide greater access to
family planning services for those of reproductive age who had
low incomes but were otherwise ineligible for Medicaid
Medicaid.gov; Ranji et al., 2016)
Prior Literature Examining Impacts of Medicaid Family Planning
Waivers
Studies of Medicaid family planning waivers indicate that
they have led to improvements in family planning (
Bronstein
et al., 2007; Kearney & Levine, 2009) and contraceptive service
use (
Adams et al., 2013; Dunlop et al., 2016). Five studies
examined the effect of Medicaid family planning expansions on
pregnancies and births. Adams et al. examined pregnancy rates
following two state-specific waiver implementations, noting a 3
percentage-point (pp) decline in current pregnancies among
nulliparous (those who have never given birth) in California
(Adams et al., 2013) and a 12.6 pp decline in unintended preg-
nancies ending in live birth in Oregon (Adams et al., 2015). Foster
et al. (2011)
estimated that nearly 290,000 unintended preg-
nancies were "averted" by California's waiver, and both
Lindrooth and McCullough (2007)
and
Kearney and Levine
estimated that states implementing Medicaid family
(2009)
planning expansions experienced reductions in overall births to
adults (Kearney & Levine, 2009; Lindrooth & McCullough, 2007)
Kearney and Levine (2009)
reported a 9% reduction in births
among nonteens when results were "scaled" up to reflect those
newly eligible for a waiver. Relatedly, studies report reductions in
public spending for unplanned pregnancies and births (
Amaral
et al., 2007; Kearney & Levine, 2009) and increases in preven-
tive health service use (e.g., routine checkups, cervical cancer
screening, STI testing) (Adams et al., 2013; Dunlop et al., 2016,
Wherry, 2013) following waiver implementation.
In addition, Medicaid family planning expansions are an
example of structural policy interventions that may promote
more equitable access to coverage for family planning and
related services, which is particularly important given the
prevalent racial and ethnic disparities in uninsurance (Artiga
et al., 2021
) and reproductive health care access and outcomes
Dehlend orf et al., 2010; Sutton et al., 2021; Thompson et al.,
). To our knowledge, only two analyses have examined the
2022
effects of Medicaid family planning waivers on racial and ethnic
disparities, finding that waivers are associated with greater re-
ductions in very low birthweight (VLBW) births among Black (vs.
white) teens (Bryant et al., 2004) and racial and ethnic disparities
in the use of highly effective methods of contraception
Dehlendorf et al., 2010). However, important gaps in the liter-
ature remain. Although some studies have examined the effect of
Medicaid family planning waivers on pregnancy and birth out-
comes, few have examined pregnancy characteristics (i.e., preg-
nancy intention and pregnancy prevention efforts) and birth
outcomes such as low birthweight (LBW) and VLBW births
Bryant et al., 2004; Dehlendorf et al., 2010).
Georgia's Medicaid Family Planning Waiver
Georgia's Planning for Healthy Babies Program@ (P4HB@) is
Georgia's Section 1115(a) Medicaid family planning demonstra-
tion waiver. Implemented in January 2011, P4HB expanded
eligibility for family planning and family planning-related ser-
vices to uninsured Georgia residents aged 18—44 years who are
able to become pregnant and have family incomes at or below
200% of the federal poverty level (FPL) (211% FPL as of April 2017)
but are otherwise ineligible for Georgia's Medicaid or Children's
Health Insurance Program (CHIP). P4HB covers family planning
and family planning—related services and supplies, including all
methods of contraception approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration; STI testing and treatment; Pap smears; pelvic
exams; colposcopies; contraceptive management, education,
and counseling; and other services routinely provided in a family
planning setting. Georgia's waiver is unique in that it explicitly
includes the goals of reducing LBW and VLBW birth rates along
with the number of unintended pregnancies and Medicaid costs.
These goals were reinforced with a unique component that
provides Medicaid coverage of selected services postpartum for
individuals giving birth to a VLBW infant. Analyzing effects of
Georgia's waiver provides insight on access to reproductive
health care in a state that has not expanded Medicaid and one
that has among the poorest and most disparate maternal out-
comes in the nation. We use a quasi-experimental design and
data from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System
(PRAMS) to examine the effects of P4HB on pregnancy charac-
teristics and birth outcomes among individuals in Georgia
compared with similar individuals in comparison states. We also
examine racial and ethnic differences in these effects.

Materials and Methods
Data Source and Study Sample
The PRAMS is a mixed-mode, population-based, state-specific
surveillance system of selected maternal behaviors and experi-
ences before and during pregnancy and 2—6 months following
birth of a liveborn infant, administered in partnership between
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state
health departments (Shulman et al., 2018). PRAMS data comprise
pregnancies ending in live birth and currently cover approxi-
mately 81% of all U.S. births (Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, 2023a). Individuals with a live birth are sampled
using state birth certificate files to ensure representativeness of
live births in the state. PRAMS oversamples subpopulations of
particular public health interest, and these are stratified using
various stratification variables, including maternal age, race/
ethnicity, infant birth weight, and geographic area (
Shulman
). To ensure high-quality data, the CDC uses a
et al., 2018
response rate threshold for making PRAMS data publicly avail-
able (
Shulman et al., 2018), ranging from 65% to 50% during our
study period (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2023b). We made no restriction to the sample based on multi-
ple gestation or other criteria.
Our study sample included data before the 2011 imple-
mentation of P4HB (2008-2010) and two post-periods both
before (2012—2013) and after (2017-2019) Affordable Care Act
(ACA) implementation. We excluded data from the year of P4HB
implementation (2011), as most pregnancies/births in this year
began before implementation. PRAMS data from Georgia for
2014-2016 were not publicly available, as the required response
rate threshold was not met. Using PRAMS data, it is not possible
to identify P4HB enrollees directly. Our study population con-
sisted of PRAMS respondents who were uninsured prepregnancy
and had a Medicaid-paid birth. These individuals likely met the
P4HB income criteria (did not qualify for Medicaid as a low-
income parent but did qualify when pregnant) and met the key
P4HB criteria of being uninsured. Using the PRAMS data and
these criteria, we identified comparison groups consistently
across states and over time.
We identified comparison states as those with 1 ) PRAMS data
available during the study period, 2) no Medicaid family plan-
ning waiver first implemented during the study period, and 3) no
change to an existing Medicaid family planning waiver during
the study period. Comparison states were Alaska, Colorado,
Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Ohio, Tennessee,
Utah, and West Virginia. We used all listed states as comparison
states in the immediate post-period (2012—2013) and non-
Medicaid expansion states (Nebraska, Tennessee, and Utah) as
the relevant comparison states in the later post-period (2017—
2019). A key criterion in selecting our comparison states was a
formal test of equality in trends of outcome measures in Georgia
and the comparison states. We adopted the event study
approach to investigate how trends in outcomes between groups
evolved before and after P4HB implementation. This approach
allows us to examine whether the parallel trend assumption is
reasonable in the difference-in-difference models. We found
limited evidence of a systematic difference in the pre-policy
trends between the comparison states and Georgia over the
short pre-period for which we have data (Appendix Figures 1-7)
In addition to examining pre-trends, the event study model
allowed us to examine how effects change over each post-
implementation period (1, 2, 6, 7, and 8 years). We conducted
two sensitivity analyses using a subset of comparison states: 1)
states that did not expand Medicaid during our full study period
(Nebraska, Tennessee, and Utah), and 2) states with data avail-
able for each year included in the analysis (Alaska, Colorado,
Massachusetts, and Utah).
Outcome Variables
We examined two outcomes related to pregnancy charac-
teristics: 1) unintended pregnancy (ending in live birth) and 2)
pregnancy prevention efforts. We also examined two birth out-
comes: 1) LBW grams) and 2) VLBW grams)
births.
Unintended Pregnancy (Ending in Live Birth)
We assessed unintended pregnancy ending in live birth using
constructed dichotomous measures that account for changes in
PRAMS questionnaires over time. For all years, PRAMS re-
spondents are asked: "Thinking back to just before you got preg-
nant with your new baby, how did you feel about becoming
pregnant?" We classified births as unintended if the response
included 1) "wanted to be pregnant later" or 2) "didn't want to be
pregnant then or at any time in the future." Births were considered
intended if the response included 1) "wanted to be pregnant
sooner" or 2) "wanted to be pregnant then." Starting in 2012, an
additional response choice was added: "I wasn't sure what I
wanted"; if a respondent indicated this response, the birth was
classified based on the answer to a second question: "When you
got pregnant with your new baby, were you trying to get pregnant?"
Births in which respondents were not sure how they felt but
were not trying to get pregnant were classified as unintended.
We tested additional models using an unintended pregnancy
measure that excluded respondents who were unsure what they
wanted. Finally, we completed a separate analysis of whether a
respondent was trying to get pregnant, based on the answer to
the following yes/no question: "When you got pregnant with your
new baby, were you trying to get pregnant?"
Pregnancy Prevention Efforts
We assessed respondents' reports of efforts to prevent preg-
nancy in both the preconception and postpartum periods.
Pregnancy prevention during the preconception period was
based on the yes/no response to the question: "When you got
pregnant with your new baby, were you or your husband or partner
doing anything to keep from getting pregnant?" This question lists
common things people use to keep from getting pregnant,
including birth control pills, condoms, withdrawal, or natural
family planning. Pregnancy prevention postpartum was based on
the yes/no response to the question: "Are you and your husband
or partner doing anything now to keep from getting pregnant?"
Birth Weight
We defined births as LBW if grams and VLBW if
< 1,500 grams.
Covariates
All models adjusted for maternal characteristics that may
confound the effect of P4HB on the outcomes of interest: age
(<20 years, 20-24 years, 25-29 years, 30—34 years, or 35 years
and older), race/ethnicity (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-
Hispanic Other, or non-Hispanic white), level of education (less
than high school degree, high school degree, some college, or

college degree), marital status, tobacco or alcohol use during
3 months before pregnancy, number of prior live births (zero, one,
two, three or more), history of abortion (yes/no), and the number
of stressful events experienced during the 12 months before birth
(e.g., separation/divorce, being in a physical fight, losing a job,
moving to a new address, losing a loved one). We also controlled
for state Medicaid expansion, a dichotomous variable indicating if
the birth occurred after a state's ACA Medicaid expansion effective
date (

Descriptive Analysis
We examined differences in maternal characteristics among
the study population in Georgia and the comparison states
during the study period using univariate and bivariate analyses.
Differences across the two groups were examined using tests
and/or t-tests, as appropriate. We examined intrastate differ-
ences in outcomes preimplementation compared with the im-
mediate post-period (2012-2013) and a later post-period (2017—
2019) using regression analysis.
Multivariable Analysis
We investigated the relationship between P4HB and preg-
nancy prevention and birth outcomes using two-way (i.e., state
and year) fixed effects (FE) modeling. We estimated the
following multivariable logistic regression models:
Yist — + ßlP4HBpost1st + ß2P4HBpost2st
+ ß3Expansionpost2st + ß4Xist + ps + tt + cist,
where i denotes an individual, s denotes the state, and t denotes
the year. Yist represents the outcomes. P4HBpost1st represents
the immediate post-period in Georgia from 2012 to 2013,
P4HBpost2st represents the later post-period in Georgia from
2017 to 2019, Expansionpost2st represents the effect of Medicaid
expansion for the comparison states that expanded Medicaid,
Xlist is the full vector of covariates, ps denotes state FE accounting
for time-invariant heterogeneity across states, and denotes
year FE accounting for yearly changes in outcomes common
across states. Last, eist represents the error term. In addition to
models among all mothers, we examined models stratified by
race/ethnicity. All models include PRAMS survey weights to ac-
count for the complex survey design and cluster standard errors
at the state level. All results are presented as marginal effects. We
conducted all analyses using Stata/SE 17.0.
Results
Descriptive Analyses
Table 1
displays sample sizes and maternal characteristics
among PRAMS respondents in Georgia and the comparison
states. The two samples were comparable with regard to age
distribution, with more than two-thirds of respondents aged 20—
29 years in both samples. There were significant differences in
the racial/ethnic distribution of the samples, with Georgia
exhibiting more racial diversity. In Georgia, 35.4% of the sample
identified as non-Hispanic Black, compared with 10.7% in the
comparison group, whereas slightly fewer (26.9%) identified as
Hispanic, compared with 30.9% in the comparison group.
Compared with individuals in comparison states, individuals
giving birth in Georgia were significantly less likely to have some
college, be married, or report smoking or drinking before preg-
nancy, but more likely to have had prior births. Finally, in-
dividuals in Georgia reported significantly fewer experiences of
stressful events during the 12 months before birth. Maternal
characteristics among PRAMS respondents in Georgia and in
each group of comparison states stratified by P4HB imple-
mentation are presented in Appendix Tables 1 and 2.
The descriptive data presented in Table 2 examine changes in
the study outcomes stratified by sample (Georgia vs. comparison
states) from the preimplementation period to the immediate
post-period and the later post-period overall and by race/
ethnicity. The results indicate a reduction in the first measure of
unintended pregnancy for both groups in the later post-period.
Among Georgia PRAMS respondents, there was a 16.4 pp
reduction in the second measure of unintended pregnancy in the
immediate post-period and a 15.0 pp reduction in the later post-
period, whereas a significant reduction in the comparison states
was only observed in the later post-period. Regarding precon-
ception pregnancy prevention, there was a large increase (30.7
pp) in the percentage of respondents reporting preconception
pregnancy prevention efforts in Georgia in the immediate post-
period (40.2%-70.9%), and no significant increase among those in
comparison states.
Neither sample showed an increase in the use of pregnancy
prevention postpartum in the immediate post-period, but post-
partum prevention declined significantly for both groups in the
later post-period. There was not a significant change in LBW
births among the sample in Georgia or the comparison states,
whereas there was a significant decline in VLBW births, from
1.8% to 0.9% among the sample in Georgia from the pre-period to
the later post-period. With regard to differences by race/
ethnicity, the percentages of non-Hispanic Black respondents in
both Georgia and comparison states with unintended pregnan-
Cies in the pre-period, were approximately 20% higher than
those for non-Hispanic white respondents. Rates of VLBW,
although lower in comparison states, were more than twice as
high for non-Hispanic Black individuals compared with non-
Hispanic white individuals in all states in the pre-period.
Multivariable Analyses
Based on the difference-in-differences analysis in
Table 3,
there was a significant decrease in the probability that a preg-
nancy in Georgia was unintended in the immediate post-period
relative to the pre-period, with a 13.3 pp decrease (p < .01 ) based
on the second measure. The effect in the immediate post-period
held only for non-Hispanic white individuals, for whom there
was a 16.4 (p < .05) to 20.4 pp (p < .01) reduction in the prob-
ability that a pregnancy was unintended in the immediate post-
period.
There is some evidence that the reduction in unintended
pregnancy remained in the later post-period. Across the two
measures, there was an 11.4 (p < .05) to 13.2 pp decrease
(p < .01) in the probability that a pregnancy was unintended
among all respondents in the later post-period. This later period
effect held only for non-Hispanic Black respondents. Among
non-Hispanic Black respondents, P4HB implementation was
associated with a 23.1 (p < .01) to 28.7 pp decrease (p < .05) in
the probability that a pregnancy was unintended in the later
post-period. We did not find significant effects on the measures
of unintended pregnancy among Hispanic respondents in either
period. Among all respondents, P4HB implementation was not

associated with significant effects on the probability of not trying
to become pregnant.
Regarding pregnancy prevention, among all respondents,
P4HB implementation was associated with a 29.2 pp increase
.001) in the probability of use of pregnancy prevention
preconception in the immediate post-period. Stratifying by race/
ethnicity reveals that the effect held for both non-Hispanic Black
(30.1 pp increase; p < .01) and non-Hispanic white (25.2 pp in-
crease; p < .01) respondents. We did not observe an association
of P4HB with pregnancy prevention preconception in the later
post-period. For pregnancy prevention postpartum, no signifi-
cant association was observed in the immediate post-period,
whereas a negative relationship was observed in the later post-
period (11.0 pp decrease; p < .05) among Hispanic respondents.
Among all respondents, no significant association was
observed between P4HB implementation and the probability of
an LBW birth in either post-period. However, among non-
Hispanic Black respondents, P4HB implementation was associ-
ated with an 8.4 pp decrease (p < .05) in the probability of an
LBW birth in the immediate post-period and a 9.0 pp decrease
(p < .05) in the later post-period. Among all respondents, P4HB
implementation was associated with a 1.1 pp decrease (p < .01)
in the probability of a VLBW birth in the immediate post-period.
This overall effect was driven by non-Hispanic Black
respondents, among whom there was a 3.9 pp decrease (p < .05)
in the probability of a VLBW birth in the immediate
post-period. Unadjusted regression results are presented in
Appendix Table 3.
Results from sensitivity analyses using comparison states that
did not expand Medicaid during the study period and sensitivity
analyses using comparison states with data available during the
full study period are similar to those found for the full set of
comparison states and are shown in Appendix Tables 4 and 5.
Discussion
Findings from this study suggest that Georgia's Medicaid
family planning waiver, P4HB, was associated with reduction in
the rate of unintended pregnancy ending in live births, and an
increase in preconception pregnancy prevention. Stratified ana-
lyses suggest that the positive impacts of P4HB on birth out-
comes occurred among non-Hispanic Black mothers, who
disproportionately experience adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Increased prepregnancy prevention and reductions in VLBW and
LBW infants, were found among non-Hispanic Black mothers in
the immediate P4HB post-period.
Although the effects found here align closely with the goals of
P4HB, the inconsistent finding of both increased pregnancy
prevention preconception and increased unintended births is
suggestive of an increase in less effective contraceptive methods,
or ineffective use, with P4HB. This is important to consider given
that failure rates of oral contraception have been found to be

higher among those living below the FPL (Sundaram et al., 2017)
and preferences and effectiveness of use vary by race/ethnicity
(Jackson et al., 2016; Kost et al., 2008; Sundaram et al., 2017
). Our
results indicate that the effect of P4HB on pregnancy prevention
preconception held for non-Hispanic Black individuals, but the
inconsistent finding noted previously held only for non-Hispanic
white individuals and only in the immediate post-period. This
may indicate that non-Hispanic Black individuals in Georgia
found increased access to family planning and, potentially, to
effective methods with the implementation of P4HB. It may also
indicate differences in how non-Hispanic white individuals
respond to a question about intendedness post-childbirth and/or
when their intention was to give birth but to do so later. Previous
research using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study
found that Black mothers had higher relative risks of reporting
an unwanted birth, rather than an intended or mistimed birth,
compared with white mothers (Guzman et al., 2010).
Our finding that P4HB, now renewed through 2029, was
associated with increases in preconception pregnancy preven-
tion echoes previous literature suggesting family planning ex-
pansions lead to increased contraceptive use (Adams et al., 2013
Dunlop et al., 2016; Redd & Hall, 2019). Similarly, previous
studies note an association between Medicaid family planning
expansions and reductions in unintended pregnancies ending in
live births (Adams et al., 2015; Foster et al., 2011). It is difficult to
compare our findings with the study of Foster et al. (2011), as it
used a Markov chain to predict the number of live births pre-
vented; however, the PRAMS-based study reported a similar
reduction of 12.6 pp in unintended pregnancies ending in live
birth in Oregon (Adams et al., 2015). Additional studies examined
the effect of Medicaid family planning expansions on birth rates
directly (
Kearney & Levine, 2009; Lindrooth & McCullough,
2007); Kearney and Levine (2009) estimated a 9% reduction in
live births among adults newly eligible for a family planning
waiver. The current study adds to the literature by examining
both preconception contraception use and unintended preg-
nancies ending in live birth. The differential findings by race/
ethnicity provide new insights that need further research and
review. Analysis of the later post-P4HB period adds important
information on potential longer-term effects of a Medicaid family
planning waiver in states that have not expanded Medicaid.
Addressing existing racial/ethnic disparities in maternal and
infant outcomes continues to be critical, and PRAMS data high-
light the disparities in LBW and VLBW births between non-
Hispanic Black and white mothers in Georgia and comparison
states. As U.S. rates of maternal morbidity and mortality exceed
those of other industrialized nations and differences by maternal
race/ethnicity persist, the need for structural changes to the U.S.
health care system grows increasingly apparent (Crear-Perry
et al., 2020
). Our finding that the associations of P4HB
with reduced unintended pregnancy and poor birth outcomes
were concentrated among non-Hispanic Black mothers in
Georgia suggests the program may have lessened these racial
disparities.
However, it is important to note that simply expanding
eligibility for Medicaid family planning services does not guar-
antee equitable access to services and correspondingly improved
health outcomes; indeed, the measures used in this analysis do
not assess reproductive autonomy, instead simply measuring
reproductive health service use and outcomes. Recent qualitative
work examining structural racism that Black women in the South
experience when accessing sexual and reproductive health ser-
vices, highlights important limitations of Medicaid family
planning coverage (Thompson et al., 2022). Thompson et al.
conducted focus groups and in-depth interviews with
(2022)
49 Black women living in Georgia and North Carolina and found
that, even with Medicaid coverage, respondents reported dis-
rupted reproductive health care use and insurmountable finan-
Cial barriers to receiving services. These findings highlight the
importance of understanding that even though efforts to expand
access are encouraging, structural overhauls within state
Medicaid programs are needed to ensure that beneficiaries have
access to timely, high-quality reproductive health care.
Even as states have expanded Medicaid, policymakers should
recognize and address the gaps in coverage that remain for in-
dividuals with incomes higher than 138% FPL who may become
Medicaid eligible based on pregnancy. Without family planning
waivers or other policies providing preconception and post-
partum coverage, individuals falling into coverage gaps typically
lack access to high-quality family planning and other health care
services critical to their reproductive care. Expanding access to
non-Medicaid subsidized insurance, such as the Marketplace, to
uninsured individuals of reproductive age has the potential to
reduce insurance "churning" pre- and postpregnancy and
Medicaid-paid births, while improving birth outcomes such as
breastfeeding (
). We note that Georgia, like many
Palmer, 2020
other states, is implementing a permanent I-year postpartum
Medicaid coverage option made available to states by the
Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022.
Limitations
This study is subject to limitations. First, we measure unin-
tended pregnancies ending in live births and hence, cannot
measure effects on all unintended pregnancies. Second, although
the PRAMS data have been successfully used to evaluate family
planning waivers, using a treatment group as defined here leaves
room for misclassification. For example, individuals who would
have been eligible for Medicaid as low-income parents but who
did not enroll prepregnancy will be included in the treatment
group, as will teens who are otherwise eligible for CHIP.
Compared with the P4HB target population of uninsured in-
dividuals otherwise ineligible for Medicaid, they are younger,
have lower incomes, and may more likely be citizens than those
enrolling only at delivery. These factors may increase their
probability of unintended pregnancy and hence, bias our
measured effect downward. Third, we do not observe the preg-
nancy outcomes among those actually enrolling in P4HB. Given
the intent-to-treat nature of this study, the effect we estimate is
by definition lower than the effect of those "treated." The PRAMS
treatment group in 2012—2013 may have characteristics different
from those who enrolled in P4HB if those in more need of
coverage for family planning and related services actually
enrolled, substantiating a lower bound effect measured here. We
note that the PRAMS data are limited in that we cannot examine
outcomes among groups such as Asian Americans, Pacific Is-
landers, American Indians, Alaska Natives, or those with multi-
racial identities. We also cannot speak to the specific types of
prepregnancy contraceptive methods used; the PRAMS question
lists common methods people use, including both more and less
effective methods. Finally, we were unable to account for the
small number of clusters in our multivariable models with ap-
proaches such as wild cluster bootstrapping when using complex
survey data commands needed for PRAMS; this may affect our
standard errors and hence, affect significance.

ABSTRACT
Introduction: Recent guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emphasize the importance of access
to comprehensive family planning services and recommend patient-centered contraceptive counseling be incorporated
into routine primary care visits for reproductive-age individuals. This study aims to describe family planning service
provision in outpatient care settings and assess differences by facility and clinician characteristics.
Methods: Using National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey data, a nationally representative survey of outpatient care
visits, we assessed family planning service provision by facility location, facility type, physician specialty, types of cli-
nicians seen, and whether the patient was seen by their primary care provider. We used random intercept logistic
regression with robust standard errors, adjusting for patient characteristics, and state and year fixed effects.
Results: The analytic sample included 53,489 patient visits with reproductive-age (15—49 years) individuals between
2011 and 2019. Family planning services were provided at 8% of total sampled visits and were more likely to be provided
in urban compared with rural areas (adjusted odds ratio, 1.45; p = .02) and at community health centers compared with
private physician practices (adjusted odds ratio, 1.74; p = .00). Family planning services were also more likely to be
provided when the patient saw a physician assistant or nurse compared with only a physician. After controlling for
observed covariates, measures of between-clinician heterogeneity indicate wide variation in which clinicians provided
family planning services.
Conclusions: Family planning services were more likely to be provided in urban areas, at community health centers, and
when patients received team-based care. The wide variation between clinicians suggests a need to better incorporate
family planning services into primary care and other outpatient settings to meet patient needs and preferences.

planning services, primary care centers such as community
health centers (CHCs) are often a key source of care for un-
derserved and marginalized populations (Biggs, Harper, Malvin,
& Brindis, 2014; Goldberg et al., 2015). Further, primary care
clinicians, including family medicine physicians, internal
medicine physicians, and pediatricians, can help to improve
access by offering family planning services when appropriate
and desired by patients. Nonphysician clinicians (such as
physician assistants (PAs), nurse practitioners, and pharma-
cists) are also encouraged to offer family planning services in
their scopes of practice to better meet patient needs (Harper
et al., 2020; Kang, Guetterman, Prussack, Ursu, & Wu, 2019,
Lee, Parisi, Akers, Borrerro, & Schwarz, 2011; Strasser, Schenk,
Dewhurst, & Chen, 2022).
Despite these recommendations, many clinicians do not
provide family planning services owing to challenges such as a
lack of knowledge or training, limited time and support staff,
misconceptions, and bias, which limit patient access (Harper
et al., 2020; Hoover, Tao, Berman, & Kent, 2010; Stulberg
et al., 2019
). Several studies cite lack of training as a barrier
to contraception provision, especially for intrauterine devices
(IUDS) and contraceptive implants. However, researchers have
also found that, even when clinicians have the relevant
training, they often still do not deliver evidence-based family
planning services (Greenberg, Makino, & Coles, 2013; Kang
et al., 2019; Shoupe, 2016; Thompson, Broecker, & Dade,
2019). Available time and support staff also impact whether
family planning services are provided, and these resources are
often limited in rural areas experiencing workforce shortages
(McNeil, Mitchell, & Parker, 2015). Research has found that
rural populations face increased barriers to accessing care and
have limited access to comprehensive family planning services
(Bodas, Strasser, Luo, Schenk, & Chen, 2023; Rodriguez, Meath,
Huang, Darney, & McConnell, 2021 ; Vaaler, Kalanges, Fonseca,
& Castrucci, 2012). In addition, clinician misconceptions and
bias—in part based on patient race/ethnicity or socioeconomic
status—can impact the provision of family planning services
Dehlendorf et al., 2010; Harper et al., 2020; Rao et al., 2023)
Several qualitative studies have explored how clinician beliefs
can limit patients' ability to make fully voluntary choices
Biggs et al., 2020; Brandi, Woodhams, White, & Mehta, 2018,
Gomez & Wapman, 2017; Senderowicz, 2019; Strasser,
Borkowski, Couillard, Allina, & Wood, 2017, Vaaler et al.,
). For example, clinicians may withhold information
2012
about options available and/or pressure patients to make
certain decisions, either implicitly or explicitly. Previous
research has also found that physician specialty, age, and
gender, as well as county characteristics, were associated with
contraceptive service provision to Medicaid beneficiaries
(Bodas et al., 2023). This research on clinician influence in
provision of family planning services aligns with other
research highlighting physician-driven effects in health care,
such as physician-driven rates of cesarean sections (Burns,
Geller, & Wholey, 1995) and medical device use (Bergman,
Grennan, & Swanson, 2021
Previous research has also examined how facility charac-
teristics impact family planning service provision. For
example, studies have found that the types of services pro-
vided differ based on clinic ownership and geography
(Bornstein, Carter, Zapata, Gavin, & Moskosky, 2018; Frost,
2008; Lindberg, Frost, Sten, & Dailard, 2006; Vaaler et al.,
). Previous research has found that almost all federally
2012
qualified health centers (FQHCs) offer some type of family
planning services, but there is wide variation in the type(s) of
services offered (Wood et al., 2014; Wood et al., 2018), orga-
nization and delivery of care (Goldberg et al., 2015
and
availability of care to underserved and adolescent populations
Goldberg et al., 2017; Mead et al., 2015). However, no studies
to our knowledge have simultaneously analyzed the associa-
tion between facility and clinician characteristics and family
planning service provision, while also stratifying by service
type.
The objective of this study was two-fold. First, we provided
descriptive statistics regarding the provision of family planning
services in outpatient care settings such as CHCs and private
physician practices (excluding Planned Parenthood and Title X
clinics). We aimed to better understand family planning services
that occur outside of family planning specialty settings because
primary care practices often face multiple challenges meeting
patients' family planning needs amidst their many other con-
cerns (Biggs, Kaller, Harper, Freedman, & Mays, 2018). Second, we
analyzed whether family planning service provision differed
based on facility and clinician characteristics, using multilevel
modeling techniques to estimate the variation between indi-
vidual clinicians. In doing so, we hope to provide valuable con-
tributions to the literature on where and by whom family
planning services are provided in outpatient care settings. This
knowledge will inform the larger discussion on the most effec-
tive and equitable strategies to improve access to family plan-
ning services. In addition, better understanding the role of
clinicians in family planning service provision can help to better
target resources and training so that patient needs and prefer-
ences are met.
Methods
Data
We analyzed data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey (NAMCS), an annual national probability sample survey of
clinicians who are involved directly in office-based ambulatory
(i.e., outpatient) care. Observations were at the visit level and
sampled visits include those with physicians, PAs, nurse practi-
tioners, and nurse-midwives. Visits at Planned Parenthood, Title
X clinics, and hospital outpatient departments were not included
in the dataset. NAMCS uses a standard clinician interview form
and automated tool to extract data from the patient record,
which helps to minimize survey recall bias and missing infor-
mation. The annual survey is conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics of the CDC. Methods used in the design,
conduct, and analysis of these surveys are fully described on the
NAMCS website, where the data are also available (National
Center for Health Statistics, 2023)
We limited our sample to reproductive-age (15-49 years)
individuals' office visits between January 1, 2011 and December
31, 2019, excluding 2017 because data were not collected and
made available that year. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
2019 is the most recent year where data were publicly available.
NAMCS survey methodology includes a binary sex indicator; all
visits in our sample were with patients who identified as female
at the time of data collection. Our study sample ranges from
approximately 2,000 to 10,000 patient visits per year, depending
on the year. Given the deidentified nature of this public use
dataset, analyses using NAMCS data are exempt from institu-
tional review board approval.

Analysis Variables
Our dependent variable was whether family planning ser-
vices were provided at the visit. We initially estimated models
based on whether any type of family planning service was pro-
vided and then estimated models based on the specific type of
service provided. For the purposes of our study, we dis-
aggregated family planning services into six categories: contra-
ceptive counseling, contraceptive pill or shot, IUD, hormonal
implant, sterilization, and abortion. These categories were
informed by NAMCS survey methodology and previous literature
(Bello et al., 2015; National Center for Health Statistics, 2023,
Sarayani et al., 2020). We used International Classification of
Diseases, 9th edition, diagnosis and procedure codes, medica-
tions, and reason for visit documented in the patient's record to
indicate if (and what type of) family planning service was pro-
vided during the visit. More than one type of family planning
service was provided in approximately 20% of our sampled visits
(e.g., contraceptive counseling and pill provided at the same
visit).
Independent variables were facility location, facility type/
ownership, type(s) of clinicians seen during the visit, physi-
cian specialty, and whether the patient saw their primary care
provider (PCP) during the visit. Facility location is urban if in a
Metropolitan Statistical Area and rural otherwise. Types of
outpatient facilities in the sample include those owned by
private physician practices; CHCs; medical/academic health
centers; and insurance companies, health plans, or health
maintenance organizations. NAMCS categorizes the following
types of facilities as CHCs: 1) FQHCs defined through the
Public Health Service Act that receive Section 330 funding, 2)
FQHC look-alikes, or community-based health care providers
that meet the requirements of the HRSA Health Center Pro-
gram but do not receive Health Center Program funding, and
3) urban Indian Health Service outpatient clinics. We included
a categorical measure of team-based care, specifically types of
clinicians seen during the visit: 1) only a physician, 2) only a
PA or nurse, 3) physician and PA, 4) physician and nurse, 5)
physician and other clinician type, 6) nurse and other clinician
type, and 7) only other clinician type. Nurses include nurse
practitioners, registered nurses, and licensed practical nurses.
Other clinician types include mental health providers, phar-
macists, and other allied health professionals. If a physician
was seen during the visit, categories of physician specialties
include general/family practice, obstetrics and gynecology,
internal medicine, pediatrics, psychiatry, and other specialty
(e.g., cardiovascular health, neurology). Last, we included a
binary variable indicating whether the patient saw their PCP
at the visit.
The analyses control for patient characteristics associated
with use of family planning services, including patient age, in-
surance type (private, Medicaid, Medicare, self-pay, no charge/
charity care, and other payment), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
White, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic other/
multiracial), chronic disease, substance use disorder, and body
mass index. Patient age was defined as a categorial variable: 15 to
19, 20 to 29, 30 to 39, or 40 to 49 years old. We controlled for
chronic diseases that previous research has found could influ-
ence use of family planning services, specifically asthma, chronic
heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and depression
(Chor, Rankin, Harwood, & Handler, 2011; Phillips-Bell,
Sappenfield, Robbins, & Hernandez, 2016). We also include
state and year fixed effects.
Statistical Analyses
For basic characterization of both outcome and predictor
variables, we conducted descriptive statistical analyses for our
total sample of visits and visits where family planning services
were provided (stratifying by specific type of service provided).
Next, we used multilevel random intercept logistic regression to
estimate the adjusted odds ratios for the relationship between
facility and clinician characteristics and provision of family
planning services. Our models included clinician-level random
intercepts (e.g., clustered by specific clinician identifier) and,
therefore, allow for nonindependence of the outcomes for
different patients treated by the same clinician given the cova-
riates. In addition, random intercept models allowed us to
differentiate the residual variation in the outcome explained by
clinician-level factors. Specifically, the random intercept residual
variance allowed us to quantify the impact of clinician-level
factors not measured by covariates on family planning service
provision. Maximum likelihood estimation with adaptive quad-
rature was used to estimate the model parameters. We also used
robust standard errors clustered at the clinician level using a
Huber-White sandwich estimator.
Across our models, we reported measures of clinician level
heterogeneity controlling for covariates, namely the residual
standard deviation, intraclass correlation (ICC), and median odds
ratio (MOR). Residual standard deviation is a measure of the
variability at the clinician level (Rabe-Hesketh & Skrondal, 2006)
The ICC measures between-clinician heterogeneity (or within-
clinician homogeneity) and is interpreted in terms of the latent
response for logistic regression models (Hedeker, 2003
). Previ-
ous studies have also used ICC as an indicator of reliability, with a
higher ICC indicating higher reliability of estimates (Rodriguez
et al., 2012
). The MOR is a measure of heterogeneity between
clinicians (after controlling for other covariates). It is the median
value of the odds ratios when comparing the odds of family
planning service provision for a patient from one randomly
selected clinician cluster with another patient that has identical
covariates, but is randomly selected from a different clinician
cluster. The MOR can be conceptualized as the increased likeli-
hood of family planning provision (in median) from seeing a
different randomly selected clinician who was otherwise iden-
tical in terms of observed covariates (Merlo et al., 2006).
All hypothesis tests reported are based on two-sided p values.
We considered p values of less than .05 to be statistically sig-
nificant. Data management and analysis were conducted using
Stata 17 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Descriptive Statistics
The sample consisted of 53,489 visits with individuals of
reproductive age (15-49 years) in outpatient care settings be-
tween 2011 and 2019. There were 11,718 unique clinicians in our
sample. A full description of sampled visits is presented in
Table 1. As shown in
, any type of family planning service
Table 2
was provided at 4,384 visits (8% of the total sample). The most
common service provided was contraceptive counseling (at
3,595 visits 17%]), followed by contraceptive pill/shot (1,129 visits
[2%]), IUDs (564 visits [1%]), hormonal implants (148 visits
[0.3%]), abortions (96 visits [0.2%]), and sterilization (44 visits
[0.1701).

For visits where any type of family planning service was
provided (leftmost column in
Table 2), the majority of visits
occurred in urban areas (87%) and at CHCs (58%). Twenty-six
percent of visits where any type of family planning service was
provided occurred with only a physician, closely followed by 25%
of visits with only a PA or nurse. The proportion of visits with
only a physician is lower for contraceptive counseling and pill/
shot (24% and 23%, respectively) and higher for IUDS, implants,
sterilization, and abortion (32%, 31 32%, and 45%, respectively).
Not surprisingly, if a patient saw a specialized physician and
family planning care was provided, the physician's specialty was
obstetrics and gynecology at almost one-third of the visits. Pa-
tients saw their PCP at 42% of the visits where family planning
services were provided. Among these visits (n 22,386), if the
PCP was a physician with a specialty, the specialization was most
commonly general/family practice, then internal medicine, ob-
stetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics (60%, 16%, 11%, and 8%,
respectively).
Random Intercept Logistic Regression: Any Type of Family
Planning Service Provided
Table 3
presents the results of adjusted random intercept
logistic regression estimating the odds ratios (ORS) for the as-
sociation between facility and clinician characteristics and any
type of family planning service provided at the visit. Regarding
facility characteristics, we found the estimated odds of any type
of family planning service being provided were 45% higher at
urban compared with rural facilities (adjusted OR [aOR], 1.45;
95% confidence interval [Cl], 1.06-1.99; p .02) and 74% higher at
CHCs compared with physician practices (aOR 1.74; 95% Cl, 1.21—
.00). Regarding clinician characteristics, our results
2.51; P
indicate the estimated odds of family planning services being
provided were higher if a patient received team-based care,
specifically seeing a physician and PA (aOR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.39—
3.41 ; p — .00) or only a PA or nurse (a0R, 2.84; 95% Cl, 1.34-5.60;
p — .00), compared with only seeing a physician at the visit. If a
patient saw a specialized physician, the estimated odds of family
planning service provision were much higher if the physician's
specialty was obstetrics and gynecology (aOR, 5.17; 95% CI, 3.94—
6.77; p 22.00) compared with general/family practice. Results for
seeing their PCP during the visit were not significant.
Our measures of between-clinician heterogeneity indicate a
high amount of variation in which clinicians provided family
planning services. The ICC was 0.23, meaning that 23% of the
variation in our outcome (family planning service provision) for
the latent response was due to clinician-level factors not
captured by the observed covariates in our model. For compar-
ison, a systematic review analyzing between-clinician variation
for different health care outcomes estimated an ICC of 4% to 11%
for clinician activity/use (i.e., ordering prescriptions, laboratory
tests), 12% to 18% for diabetes care and outcomes, and up to 84%
for patient satisfaction with PCPs (Fung et al., 2010). Researchers
have also theorized that a high ICC (meaning high variability
between individual clinicians) indicates high potential for qual-
ity improvement at the clinician level (Berwick, 1991 ). The esti-
mated MOR was 2.60, meaning if two clinicians in our dataset
(identical in terms of observed covariates) were randomly
selected, one would have a 2.60 times higher median odds of
providing family planning services compared with the other.
Overall, these measures of between-clinician heterogeneity
indicate that specific clinicians were much more likely to provide
family planning care compared with others after controlling for
observed covariates.
Random Intercept Logistic Regression: Stratified by Type of
Service Provided
In our next set of models, we performed separate regressions
for specific types of family planning services, focusing on con-
traceptive care (counseling, pill/shot, IUD, and hormonal
implant) given the small sample sizes for sterilization and

abortion. Contraceptive counseling was 50% more likely to be
provided in urban compared with rural areas (aOR, 1.50; 95% CI,
1.02—2.21; p — .04) and 92% more likely to be provided at CHCs
compared with physician practices (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.25-2.96;
p — .00). Contraceptive counseling was also more likely to be
provided with team-based care, specifically when the patient
saw a physician and PA (aOR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.64—4.34; p — .00) or
physician and other type of clinician (aOR, 1.31 ; 95% CI, 1.01—1.71 ;
p — .04), compared with only a physician. The contraceptive pill/
shot was significantly more likely to be provided when the pa-
tient saw only a PA or nurse compared with only a physician
(aOR, 5.37; 95% CI, 2.39-12.05; p — .00), likely owing to the na-
ture of this service. For IUDs and implants, presented categories
for team-based care were not significant, indicating that these
services were more likely to be provided when only a physician
was seen (the reference category). Across all types, family plan-
ning services were more likely to be provided if the physician's
specialty was obstetrics and gynecology compared with general/
family practice. The magnitude is highest for IUDs (aOR, 10.00;
95% CI, 5.50—18.18; p — .00) and lowest for the pill/shot (aOR,
1.92; 95% CI, 1.26—2.92; p — .00). Results for PCP seen during the
visit were not significant.
Sensitivity Analyses
In our first sensitivity analysis, we estimated the measures of
between-clinician heterogeneity for specific types of family
planning services (see bottom of Table 4). The ICC ranges from
14% (for IUD visits) to 28% (for counseling visits), and the MOR
follows a similar pattern. We also estimated the ICC for common
facility ownership types and found the ICC was 28% for private
physician practices and 18% for CHCs. Overall, measures of be-
tween-clinician heterogeneity were relatively consistent, even
when stratifying by type of family planning service and facility
type. This further supports the hypothesis that certain clinicians
were much more likely to provide family planning services
compared with others.
In our second sensitivity analysis, we estimated random
intercept regression models during specific years. Although the
survey is designed to be nationally representative every year, the
NAMCS has used slightly different survey and sampling designs
over 2011 to 2019, so we wanted to ensure the robustness of our
regression results across years. In Appendix Table A.l, we present
adjusted odds ratios for any type of family planning service being
provided. These estimates indicate that our results are qualita-
tively similar over the study period. Owing to changes in sam-
pling design and weighting schema, we are not able to estimate
how the overall prevalence of family planning service provision
has changed in our sample between the years 2011 and 2019
(National Center for Health Statistics, 2023).
Discussion
This study analyzed the association between facility and
clinician characteristics and family planning services provided
during outpatient care visits in the United States. We aimed to
better understand family planning services that occur in primary
care outpatient settings such as CHCs and private physician
practices, rather than family planning specialty settings (e.g.,
Planned Parenthood and Title X clinics). By clustering our results
at the clinician level, we were able to quantify the variation be-
tween specific clinicians in the odds of family planning service
provision. To our knowledge, this study is the first to empirically


investigate the role of facility and clinician characteristics on the
likelihood of family planning service provision using a large,
nationally representative dataset and multilevel modeling
techniques. The use of a large national dataset makes our find-
ings broadly generalizable to the outpatient care setting.
We find that any type of family planning service was provided
at 8% of the total sampled visits. Contraceptive counseling was
provided most commonly; other family planning services were
not provided very often. We also find that family planning ser-
vices were more likely to be provided in urban areas, at CHCs,
and when patients received team-based care. Our results indi-
cate that some clinicians were much more likely than others to
provide family planning services (after controlling for observed
covariates), which is consistent with other literature highlighting
clinician influence on health care use (Flynn, Smith, & Davis,
2002; Fred, 2016; Fung et al., 2010). This finding suggests that
diverse clinician beliefs and practices may influence what (and if)
family planning services are provided to patients.

This study has several limitations. Our data source, NAMCS,
does not include several variables—such as patient sexual ac-
tivity, sexual orientation, pregnancy desires, or physician age,
gender, and race/ethnicity—that may influence our observed
outcomes. Another limitation is that we were unable to ascertain
patient preferences or disentangle selection effects regarding
family planning service provision. We would expect some vari-
ation between clinicians owing to factors such as patient selec-
tion and clinician experience and training. However, the
measures of between-clinician heterogeneity in our study are
high relative to measures of between-clinician heterogeneity for
other health care processes and outcomes in the literature (Fung
et al., 2010
). Future research should further explore these se-
lection effects to better understand the causal impact of facility
and clinician characteristics on family planning service
provision.
Implications for Policy and/or Practice
Ensuring access to comprehensive patient-centered family
planning services is a key strategy in advancing reproductive
autonomy. Our results suggest that more work may be needed to
ensure clinicians are willing and able to provide family planning
care as recommended by the CDC and several professional
medical societies. Studies have found that training and support
for patient-centered counseling may be an effective approach to
increase access to comprehensive family planning services and
support reproductive agency (Dehlendorf, Grumbach,
Schmittdiel, & Steinauer, 2017, Harper et al., 2020; Stulberg
). Broader facility-level system changes may also be
et al., 2019
needed to address barriers so that PCPs are able to incorporate
family planning services when appropriate and desired by pa-
tients. These changes may include expanded referral networks,
modifications in team-based care processes (such as nonphysi-
cian clinicians providing family planning services in some cases),
billing and payment incentives, and/or patient engagement and
education tools. In addition, policy changes related to over-the
counter contraception, telehealth regulation, and scope of prac-
tice laws may decrease barriers to access.
Conclusions
Our findings inform the broader discussion on the most
effective and equitable strategies to improve access to family
planning services. Understanding the role of facility and clinician
characteristics in service provision can help to better target re-
sources and training so that patient needs and desires are met.
Given that primary care is the principal source of health care for
many pregnancy-capable people, increasing the proportion of
clinicians who offer patient-centered contraceptive counseling
in primary care settings is key to improving access and outcomes.
On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs
v. Jackson Women 's Health Organization, no longer acknowledging
the constitutional right to an abortion (
National Constitution
). Abortion access has been further restricted in
Center, 2022
the wake of this ruling, highlighting a need to integrate family
planning services, in particular contraceptive counseling, to
ensure patient reproductive needs and desires are met. Future
work should focus on understanding barriers and developing
interventions to incorporate recommended family planning
services into primary care and other appropriate outpatient
settings.

immediate neonatal outcomes were assessed. A total of 926 pregnant women with a positive test
for SARS-CoV-2 were included, among which 92 (9.9%) presented with severe COVID-19 disease.
Risk factors for severe maternal outcomes were pulmonary comorbidities [aOR 4.3, 95% Cl 1.9—9.5],
hypertensive disorders [aOR 2.7, 95% Cl 1.0—7.0] and diabetes [aOR2.2, 95% Cl 1.1—4.5]. Pregnant
women with severe maternal outcomes were at higher risk of caesarean section [70.7% (n = 53/75)],
preterm delivery [62.7% (n = 32/51)] and newborns requiring admission to the neonatal intensive
care unit [41.3% (n = 31/75)]. In this study, several risk factors for developing severe complications of
SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women were identified including pulmonary comorbidities,
hypertensive disorders and diabetes. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes appear to be influenced by
the severity of maternal disease.
Altered immunity, reduced respiratory capacity, vascular and hemodynamic changes put pregnant women at
higher risk of complications, while specific harm to the exposed fetus/newborn may be observed. Although,
early reports from the SARS-CoV-2 epidemicl suggested that the clinical course for infected pregnant women
was similar to the general population, more recent data suggest a higher risk of severe outcomes in pregnant
women compared to the general population at an equivalent age, with severe outcomes observed in 8 to 110/02 6
In the general population, preexisting health conditions, namely pulmonary pathologies, hypertension and
diabetes have been associated with severe outcomes7'8. Information on the impact of these determinants on the
maternal disease evolution and other risk factors specific to pregnancy is still fragmented, although evidence
suggest that they might contribute to the severity of the disease6 9. Furthermore, fetal/newborn risks still need
to be better assessed as vertical transmission of the virus and placental infection appears to be possible with
10-13
newborns potentially demonstrating related symptoms
, while a significantly higher rate of preterm deliveries
(25—30%) among women with Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) has been reported3 4.
Information on specific risks among pregnant women are urgently needed to provide evidence-based guide-
lines for the management of this vulnerable population. To accomplish this, we developed an international web
registry14 in March 2020, to promote a structured collection of data regarding pregnant women and their fetuses
exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Using this dataset, we performed a case—control study to assess the risk of severe mater-
nal outcomes and associated risk factors as well as a description of pregnancy/neonatal outcomes stratified for
the severity of the disease among pregnant women with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Materials and methods
Study setting and population. The patients enrolled in this study are part of the COVI-Preg international
registry investigating the consequences of SARS-Cov-2 infection during pregnancy14. All pregnant women tested
for SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage of gestation were eligible for inclusion in this multicenter study except
those < 18 years of age as well as individuals declining to consent or not able to consent for themselves. Informed
oral or written consent was obtained for all participants. Deidentified data were prospectively recorded by each
center (Table Sl) using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) electronic data capture t00115'16. uality
checks were performed as described in the Supplementary Materials. Using this dataset, we performed a case
control study among pregnant women with a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The study was approved by both the Swiss Ethical Board (CER-VD-2020-00548) and the local ethics boards
at each participating center. The study was conducted from March 24th to July 26th, 2020. All methods were
carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations in the manuscript.
Inclusion criteria and SARS-CoV-2 status. Pregnant women were tested for SARS-CoV-2 either
because of a suspected infection due to ongoing symptoms compatible with COVID- 19 or an history of potential
exposure or through routine systematic screening instituted during the pandemic in some hospitals depending
on local capacities and guidelines. Maternal testing was performed using a nasopharyngeal RT-PCR for SARS-
COV-2 swab test. Pregnant women with a positive RT- PCR test result at any stage during pregnancy irrespective
of clinical signs and symptoms were considered as having a confirmed infection and included in the present
study. Pregnant women with a SARS-CoV-2 negative test and no other positive test result during the entire
follow-up period were excluded.
Case and control definition. Pregnant women with severe adverse outcomes, defined as any of the follow-
ing: (1) the need for advanced oxygen support (i.e. high flow cannula, non-invasive ventilation through CPAP
or mechanical ventilation), (2) admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and (3) maternal death, were classified
as cases. The control group included pregnant women with either mild adverse outcomes, defined as maternal
hospitalization requiring oxygen supplementation, or no adverse outcomes, defined as outpatient management
or hospitalization not requiring oxygen supplementation.
Identification of risk factors for severe adverse maternal outcome. Pregnant women with severe
adverse outcomes (cases) were compared to pregnant women with mild or no adverse outcomes (controls).
The effect of maternal characteristics known to be risk factors7'8'17 for SARS-CoV-2 severe adverse outcomes in
the general population were tested (i.e. maternal age > 35 years old, obesity defined as a BMI> 30, hypertensive
disorders, pre-and gestational diabetes, preexisting pulmonary, cardiovascular, renal, or oncologic disease and
immunosuppression), as well as pregnancy related risk factors such as nulliparity (dichotomized as yes/no), eth-

Figure l. Flow chart. "Ihe COVI-Preg international registry was launched in March 2020. To date, 120
centers from 16 countries have contributed patients (supplementary Table 1). All pregnant women tested for
SARS-CoV-2 infection at any stage of gestation were eligible for inclusion in this multicenter study except
those < 18 years of age as well as individuals declining to consent or not able to consent for themselves.
Deidentified data were prospectively recorded by each center using the REDCap (Research Electronic Data
Capture) electronic data capture t00115'16. At inclusion (i.e. at the time of SARS-CoV-2 screening), the following
data were recorded: socio-demographic characteristics, obstetrical history and information on SARS-CoV-2
exposure. Pregnancies were monitored as clinically indicated according to local protocols. After inclusion, the
following data were collected: results of maternal testing (SARS-CoV-2 and/or other infectious pathogens),
COVID- 19 history, maternal, pregnancy and neonatal outcomes. Data were analyzed using Stata 14 (StataCorp.

Secondary outcomes: absolute risk (%) of obstetrical outcomes and neonatal outcomes. For
completed pregnancies (i.e. pregnancy ending in either fetal loss > 14 WG or livebirth, obstetrical outcomes
(pregnancy outcome, GA at delivery, mode of delivery) and neonatal outcomes (neonatal death, neonatal admis-
Sion to the ICU (NICU), birthweight and rates of suspected perinatal SARS-CoV-2) were assessed. For multi-
ple gestations (n = 26), the analysis considered the whole pregnancy. Fetal loss was defined as a spontaneous
antepartum fetal death > 14 WG (i.e. late miscarriage (14—24 WG) and stillbirth (fetal demise > 24 WG). Sus-
pected perinatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission was defined as a positive RT-PCR result performed at birth.
Statistical analysis. We performed a multivariate analysis to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% CIS
adjusting for risk factors of COVID-19 severity (i.e. maternal age, BMI, pre- and gestational hypertensive disor-
ders (including pre-eclampsia), pre-and gestational diabetes, pre-existent pulmonary comorbidities, other pre-
gestational comorbidities (cardiovascular, renal, oncological diseases and immunosuppression), and gestational
risk factors of severe maternal outcomes (ethnicity, parity, pregnancy conditions (threatened preterm labor, pla-
centa previa, placental malfunction and PPROM) and exposure after 20WG) and accounting for missing values
as described in the supplementary material.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 14 (StataCorp. 2015. Stata Statistical Software: Release 14.
College Station, TX: StataCorp LP). A P value less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Results
Between March 24 and July 26, 2020, 1079 pregnant women tested for SARS-CoV-2 were enrolled in the reg-
istry among which 926 had a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 1). Socio-demographic characteristics
are presented in Table 1. A third of the women were asymptomatic (31.9% n = 295/926), while cough (40.4%,
n = 374/926), fever (32.4%, n = 300/926) and anosmia/ageusia (17.8%, n = 165/926) were the most reported

symptoms. 9.9% (n = 92/926) experienced severe maternal outcomes, including 7.3% (n = 68/926) requiring
advanced oxygen support and 4.0% (n = 37/926) requiring ICU admission; 6 maternal deaths were recorded
(0.6%) (Table 2).
Risk factors for severe maternal outcomes among positive pregnant women. In a univariate
analysis pulmonary comorbidities [crude OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.6—8.9], hypertensive disorders [crude OR 3.5, 95%
CI 1.2—9.1], diabetes [crude OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.2—5.3] and BMI> 30 [crude OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1—2.9] were signifi-
cantly associated with an increased risk of severe maternal outcomes (Table 3). In a multivariate analysis adjust-
ing for risk factors of COVID-19 severity, gestational risk factors of severe maternal outcomes, and accounting
for missing values through multiple imputation, pulmonary comorbidities [aOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.9—9.5], hyperten-
Sive disorders [aOR 2.7, 95% CI 1.0—7.0] and diabetes [2.2, 95% CI 1.1—4.5] remained significantly associated,
while BMI > 30 did not retain significance [aOR 1.3, 95% CI 0.8—2.2]. When adjusting for COVID-19 risk factors
only, similar results were obtained (Table 3). Common pregnancy related risk factors were not associated with
severe maternal outcomes (i.e. nulliparity, ethnicity, multiple pregnancy, gestational age at infection).
Secondary outcomes. Absolute risk of pregnancy, obstetrical and neonatal outcomes. No differences were
observed in terms of livebirth rate among positive women with severe adverse outcomes (i.e. cases) compared
to women with no or mild adverse outcomes (i.e. controls) [absolute rate 92.6% (n = 75/81) compared to 98.1%
(n = 656/669)] (Table 4), although a trend toward poorer obstetrical outcomes was observed among women with
severe adverse outcomes [absolute rate of fetal loss > 14 WG 7.4% (n = 6/81) compared to 1.9% 13/669)].
An increased risk of caesarean section was observed among patients with severe adverse outcomes [absolute
caesarean sections rate 70.7% (n = 53/75) compared to 30.9% (n = 203/656)]. Similarly, women with severe ma-
ternal outcomes were at increased risk of preterm delivery< 37 WG [absolute risk 62.7% (n = 32/51) compared
to 36.3% (78/215)] and < 34 WG [absolute risk 51.9% (n = 14/27) compared to 20.5% (24/117)], most of which
were iatrogenic [81.3% (n = 26/32) and 85.7% (n = 12/ 14), respectively]. Newborns born to mothers with severe
adverse pregnancy outcomes were more frequently admitted to NICU [absolute risk 41.3% (n = 31/75) compared
to 11.6% (n = 76/656)]. The most frequent reasons for admission were prematurity [71.0% (n = 22/31)] and res-
piratory distress [48.5% (n = 15/31)] (Table 4). A positive SARS-CoV-2 test at birth was observed in 2.9% of neo-
nates (n = 11/384).) The rates of suspected perinatal transmission and reduced birthweight were similar between
newborns born to mothers with severe outcomes compared to those with no or mild outcomes.
Discussion
In this study, we present the largest cohort of pregnant women tested for SARS-Cov-2 worldwide and the first
analysis of primary data stratified by the severity of maternal disease, allowing us to identify specific risk factors
associated with adverse maternal outcomes.
Severe adverse outcomes, defined by maternal death, admission to ICU and/or advanced oxygen support
were observed in 9.9% of cases. Pulmonary comorbidities, hypertensive disorders and diabetes mellitus were
significantly associated with an increased risk of severe maternal outcomes, while usual pregnancy related risk
factors were not. No difference in the livebirth rate was observed between pregnant women with severe adverse
outcomes and patients with an uncomplicated course. Nevertheless, a significant increased risk of caesarean sec-
tion, preterm birth and neonatal admission to the intensive care unit was observed, highlighting that obstetrical
and neonatal outcomes are influenced by the severity of maternal disease.
The rate of severe disease observed here is similar to what has been previously reported in other large
cohorts3-5 and summarized in a recent meta-analysis6,where the risk of severe disease among pregnant women
with COVID-19 was estimated to be 13% (95%CI 6—21%). Importantly, this risk of severe maternal complica-
tions appears significantly higher when compared to a non-pregnant population at an equivalent age, with an
increased odds of ICU admission or mechanical ventilation up to 1.6 (95%CI 1.3—2.0) and 1.9 (95%CI 1.4—2.6)
respectively6.
Risk factors for severe maternal disease appear to be similar to what has been previously described in the
general population, namely pulmonary pathologies, hypertension and diabetes7 8. Congruently, in their meta-
analysis, Allotey et al. observed an increased risk of severe disease among pregnant women > 35 y.o., those with
chronic hypertension, pre-existing diabetes, or body mass index > 306. Interestingly, in our study, after adjust-
ment, obesity was not independently associated with an increased risk of severe adverse outcomes. This could be
explained by the fact that overweight patients often suffer from hypertension and diabetes (metabolic syndrome),
which could act as the predominant causal factors. Both are associated with macro- and micro-vascular com-
plications, and endothelial dysfunction has been suggested as a major pathophysiological mechanism associ-
18,19
ated with COVID-19 severity . In pregnancy, endothelial change is a well-known mechanism of obstetrical
complications, such as gestational hypertension, HELLP (Hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets) and
pre-eclampsia20, and may contribute to the increased risk of COVID-19 complications. In our study, we did
not observe any association with maternal age. This could be explained by the low number of patients > 35 Y.O.
included. Similarly, ethnicity (non-Caucasian versus Caucasian) was not associated with poorer outcomes, unlike
previously described21
We observed a 2.9% rate of positive test among newborns born to mothers with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test.
The clinical relevance of this finding remains unclear, as, at the time of the study, we were lacking comprehensive
data regarding COVID-related symptoms or COVID-suspected symptoms among newborns, repeated testing

to excludel 4. Alternatively, transplacental transmission has been suspected in few cases, where specific IgM
23,24
were detected among newborns . Nevertheless, perinatal/vertical transmission appear to be rare and mainly
associated with good neonatal outcomes
Our study has several limitations. First, we present here the outcomes among pregnant women with a con-
firmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore only observational conclusions can be drawn regarding the absolute
risks of severe disease and adverse obstetrical/neonatal outcomes, as a control group of negative patients was not
included. Nevertheless, this was beyond the scope of the present study, whose first aim was to identify specific
risk factors.
Second heterogeneities exist between participating centers in the testing of pregnant women. While some
centers performed routine systematic screening of presenting women independently of compatible symptoms,
other only tested symptomatic pregnant women. This could have led to a selections bias of more severe sympto-
matic COVID- 19 cases. Ifa symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with poorer maternal, obstetrical
and neonatal outcomes, this selection bias may have resulted in an overestimation of the absolute risk of adverse
outcomes. However, the rate of asymptomatic infections among included positive women of 31.9% (n = 295/926)
is quite similar to the rate of asymptomatic infection described in the general population, estimated to range
25,26
around 40—45% and suggests a low impact of this potential bias. Similarly, patients admitted with severe
disease were very likely systematically tested for SARS-CoV-2, which may have led to a possible overestimation
of the actual rate of severe adverse outcome among positive patients. Follow-up analysis, including patients with
ongoing pregnancies with an uncomplicated course based on systematic screening will help assess the exact risk
in a more general population of pregnant women.
Third, most patients were included during the 3rd trimester of gestation, with the majority included close
to delivery, while 130 pregnancies were still ongoing at the time of analysis. Although, we did not observe any
impact of the gestational age (i.e. > 20 WG) on the severity of maternal disease, this could be related to a lack
of statistical power. Pregnancy-related vascular complications only occur after 20 WG, which would suggest
an increased risk of maternal complications in cases of maternal infection at a later stage of the pregnancy, as
observed by others9. In our cohort, severe maternal outcomes were also observed in women exposed at < 20 WG,
with an overall similar risk (n = 8/89, 9.0%) to what was described in the whole cohort. Therefore, caution should
also be taken with pregnant women infected in early pregnancy.
Although our data regarding obstetrical outcomes are reassuring, definite conclusions cannot be drawn.
Infections occurring at an earlier stage of gestation may be associated with poorer obstetrical outcomes. Viral
particles have been detected within the placentas of women infected earlier during pregnancy
Although
28-30
placental infection seems rare, it has been associated with evidence of malperfusion
, which is known to be
associated with reduced fetal growth and intra-uterine fetal death. Of note, Khalil et al. have shown an increase in
the number of stillbirths during the epidemic peak, without being able to determine whether this is a direct effect
of the virus31. At the time of analysis, pregnancies < 37 WG that were exposed during the 1st and 2nd-trimesters
were still ongoing (Fig. 1), suggesting an uncomplicated course. Subsequent analysis, including those patients,
are needed to better define obstetrical and neonatal outcomes.
In conclusion, pregnant women, particularly those with associated comorbidities, seem to be at higher risk
of severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Obstetrical and neonatal outcomes appear to be influenced
by the severity of maternal disease; complications include caesarean sections, neonatal prematurity and neonatal
admission to the intensive care unit. Further studies are needed to assess maternal and neonatal outcomes for
cases of earlier exposure.

Abstract: Perception and knowledge of risk factors for pregnancy influence health behaviors during
pregnancy and childbirth. We used a descriptive qualitative study to examine the perception and
knowledge of risk factors in pregnancy and childbirth in low-income urban women in Ghana. Over
the course of three-months, 12 focus group discussions and six individual interviews were conducted
with 90 participants selected from six communities in the study area. Data were analyzed using
inductive-thematic content analysis. Findings revealed that participants had knowledge of some risk
factors, although some had superstitious beliefs. Participants viewed pregnancy as an exciting and
unique experience, but also challenging, with a host of medical and psychological risks. Pre-existing
medical conditions (e.g., diabetes), lack of physical activity, poverty, poor nutrition, and lack of social
support were identified as conditions that could lead to negative pregnancy outcomes. Superstitious
beliefs such as exposure to "evil eye" during pregnancy, as well as curses and spells, were also
identified as risk factors for pregnancy complications. This research has implications for policies and
programs to improve pregnancy outcomes for low-income women in Ghana. Thus, we recommend
social and economic support programs as well as health education to change misperceptions about
pregnancy risk and to support other efforts being made to improve maternal health outcomes.

1. Introduction
Risk is defined as a factor that presents eminent danger or increases the probability
of experiencing adverse outcomes [1,2]. Perception, on the other hand, refers to a mental
image or subjective ideas about a potential occurrence of a phenomenon [3]. The concept
of perception is important because it is a driver of health-seeking behavior and the man-
agement of health outcomes [4]. Risk perception, therefore, refers to risk interpretations
or understanding, as well as subjective judgements about risk [2]. In the field of health,
risk perception denotes subjective judgements about the likelihood of negative or adverse
outcomes of conditions such as illnesses, injuries, diseases, or death. Perceptions and
knowledge about risk are important determinants of health behaviors and risk-related
decision-making, such as whether to adopt or not to adopt healthy behaviors and reject or
accept a certain level of health risks [2 5
Risk perception has two dimensions: the cognitive aspect, which relates to how much
individuals know and understand risks; and the emotional aspect, which relates to how
people feel about themselves and a potential risk [6]. Research on risk perception often
begins with the presumption that how people feel about danger is determined by the level
of knowledge and certainty they have regarding that risk. This idea is founded on the
rational choice model of decision-making, which presents individuals as rational beings
who evaluate the possibilities of health outcomes after first estimating the prospective costs
and benefits. On the other hand, laypersons usually assess risk by using heuristics (for
Women 2022, 2, 385-396. https://doi.org/10.3390/women2040035

Women 2022, 2
386
example, previous experiences) and other informal ways of thinking [2,7]. This means that,
when people are aware of certain risks or potential risks, they tend to believe that those
risks could happen more frequently than the risks actually occur, and vice versa. These risk
misinterpretations, rooted in heuristics, can cause people to overestimate or underestimate
the occurrence and severity of potential health threats [2].
According to Lennon [8], risk perception in pregnancy entails both the objective
medical evaluation of risk as well as a subjective, socially constructed risk, guided by a
complex web of personal, psychological, and cultural factors. It includes the assessment of
the possibility of harm or negative health outcomes to either the mother or the newborn
or both. However, sometimes this harm or risk is not related to a particular medical
condition; instead, women may see pregnancy and childbirth as inherent risks rather
than conditions that cause the risk. In recent years, risk perception and the way risks are
construed in pregnancy have received a lot of scholarly attention [8]. This can be explained
in part by the growing prevalence of a medicalized perspective on pregnancy and the
social pressure placed on women to behave in a way that lessens the perceived risks [8].
Increasingly, medical interventions are seen as both necessary and desirable for successful
pregnancies, as the state of pregnancy has become more and more medicalized. Thus,
seeking preventive services such as antenatal screening, genetic screening, and testing, as
well as health behavior modifications, are considered necessary to reduce any potential risk
of pregnancy complications [8,9].
Furthermore, considerable evidence shows that perceptions and understanding (or
knowledge) of risk are shaped by many factors, including socio-cultural background [10],
levels of literacy [11], and religious or traditional beliefs [11,12]. An individual's knowledge
and interpretation of risk is also dependent on their personal life philosophy and previous
experience [9]. It has been documented that sometimes women perceive risk in relation to
pregnancy from the social perspective, where risk is seen as being influenced by the social,
cultural, and political milieu in which they reside [8,9]. Wheeler and colleagues [13], for
example, reported women's employment experience during pregnancy as an important
factor in determining their perception of risk in pregnancy. Furthermore, other scholars
have reported that maternal age [14—16], personal and family history [17], knowledge about
pregnancy and childbirth [18], as well as level of risk or complication in pregnancy [19]
are important determinants of perception and understanding of risk in pregnancy. These
factors can influence opinions, interpretations of and values put on the risks and even
benefits associated with pregnancy [12]. In a qualitative study on pregnancy risk perception
and preterm birth, Silva and colleagues [17] found that personal negative experiences in
previous pregnancies, such as stillbirths, miscarriages, having a preterm birth or neonatal
death, informed risk perceptions of the current pregnancy. Women's perception of risk in
pregnancy has also been attributed to their knowledge-base of risk [20].
Perception and understanding of risk in pregnancy have the effect of influencing
various critical pregnancy and childbirth decisions. They affect decisions such as when
and where to seek antenatal care, where to give birth (or choice of maternity site), who
supervises the birth and even the mode of delivery [8,21]. Silva and colleagues [17] also
argued that a patient's risk perception of health guides his or her decisions on treatment
and can further influence health-seeking behavior during serious conditions such as pre-
term births, one of the most critical potential risks faced during pregnancy. Janson [22], on
childbirth decisions and traditional structures in Ghana, explained that women who viewed
childbirth as a natural process, and without potential risks or ill health, may consider home
delivery as the best option. Traditionally, in Ghanaian society, pregnancy and childbirth
are viewed as a vulnerability and potentially dangerous experiences that do not only
require biomedical care, but also spiritual intervention. Therefore, many women seek a
combination of care: biomedical care, traditional care (which involves the use of herbal
medicine) and spiritual support (faith healing and prayer) in the pregnancy period with
the hope of averting any perceived or actual health risk to the pregnancy and during
childbirth [23]. The focus of this paper, therefore, is to present findings from a study

that investigated women's perception and knowledge of risk in pregnancy and childbirth,
and how these affect their maternal healthcare seeking behavior in selected low-income
communities in Accra. The implications of the findings for maternal and newborn health
policies and programs are discussed.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design
This was a descriptive qualitative study that targeted women in selected low-income
communities in Accra, Ghana. The data were gathered over a three-month period through
focus group discussions (FGDs) and interviews to examine women's perception and knowl-
edge about risk in pregnancy and childbirth.
2.2. Study Area
The study was conducted in the Ashiedu-Keteke sub-metropolitan district in the city
of Accra, Ghana's capital. Ashiedu-Keteke is one of the 3 sub-metropolitan districts of
Accra Metropolitan City and has some of the poorest communities in the city. Using the
Greater Accra region population growth of 3.1%, the sub-metropolis has an estimated
population of about 143,990 in 2018 [24]. The sub-metropolis has the Central Business
District (CBD), and it is the center of major commercial activities within the city of Accra,
with an influx of approximately 2 million people from all parts of the country daily [24]. As
the center of commerce, it houses the Markola and Agbogbloshie markets, which are two
major markets within the Greater Accra region. The population of Ashiedu-Keteke is made
up of the indigenous Ga people, who live in the coastal communities along the Gulf of
Guinea (the Atlantic Ocean), and other migrant populations, who reside a bit further away
from the coast. The main occupation of the indigenous Ga people is fishing; the men do the
fishing, and the women smoke the fish for the market. The migrant population engages in
small-scale commercial activities, mostly trading.
In terms of health care, the Ussher Polyclinic, the Prince Marie Louise Children's
Hospital, and the James Town Maternity are among the major health facilities that provide
care to residents in the sub-metropolitan district. Maternal health continues to be a health
challenge as Ashiedu-Keteke has one of the poorest maternal health outcomes in Accra and
has a persistently high teenage pregnancy rate in the city [25,26]. There is high prevalence
of the use of informal maternal health care (traditional birth attendance, faith healing, and
prayer) by pregnant women in the area, especially among the teenage and indigenous
mothers. From available data, about 40% of pregnant women who reside in the sub
metropolitan district do not seek antenatal care until the second and third trimesters, a
situation quite a bit higher than the national average of 36%[27].
2.3. Sampling of Participants and Data Collection
Purposive sampling was utilized to select six communities within the study area for
the FGDs and individual interviews. Altogether, 90 women between the ages of 17 and
45 years were recruited for 12 focus group discussions, and six individuals were involved
in the interviews. For the FGDs, a snowball sampling approach was employed to recruit
84 women who had at least one child. We conducted two FGDs in each of the communities.
We divided the women in the FGDs into two age cohorts: those aged 17 to 29 and those aged
30 to 45. Each FGD had an average of seven participants and lasted between 45—60 min. We
conducted six FGDs with each age cohort. Additionally, six women with at least one child
from each of the six communities (one mother from each community) were interviewed for
about 30 min to elicit in-depth perspectives on the subject matter. Two community leaders
assisted with the recruitment of the study participants.
The FGDs and individual interviews both used comparable questions, which were
framed around our research objectives. We asked participants about their knowledge and
risk perceptions with regard to pregnancy and childbirth and how these factors influenced
their healthcare seeking decisions and behaviors during pregnancy and childbirth. Both


Women 2022, 2
388
FGDs and interviews were carried out with the assistance of our two fieldworkers and in
two local languages spoken in the study area. The two field assistants were native speakers
of the two local languages (Ga and Twi). The FGDs and interviews were audio recorded
with the participants' permission.
2.4. Ethical Consideration
The Human Subject Review Committee of the University of Massachusetts Amherst
School of Public Health granted the ethical approval of the research. Additionally, we
received authorization from the local health administration in the study area and verbal
consent from all study participants prior to their enrollment in the study. Since most of our
study participants had only a basic formal education, we only sought verbal consent from
them prior to recruitment into the study and assured them that information obtained from
the FGDs and interviews would be kept confidential, and only the lead researcher would
have access to the raw data. Participation in the study was voluntary, and they had the
option of withdrawing at any time.
2.5. Data Analysis
The data analysis began during the data collection phase and continued following
FGDs and interview sessions. With the assistance of our two fieldworkers, audio recordings
of both FGDs and interviews were transcribed from the local languages into English.
Following transcription, we cross-checked the transcripts to confirm that the responses
had been accurately transcribed and translated from the local languages to English. We
reviewed the final transcripts in order to determine which words, phrases, and statements
were pertinent to our primary research questions and objectives. We classified the data
into nine themes using an inductive content analysis approach proposed by Corbin and
Strauss [28] and Miles and colleagues [29].
We first identified and cataloged the major concepts and recurring ideas in each
interview transcript. Second, we compared and classified the significant concepts and
emerging themes from the interview transcripts. We did the same thing with the transcript
data from the FGDs; we compared significant concepts and developing themes within and
across FGDs. The raw text section containing the essential concepts and ideas were coded
manually and classified according to the emergent themes. To ensure the findings' internal
validity, we compared and contrasted data segments from the FGDs with the individual
interviews [
]. In this article, we present data on nine themes that emerged from our
28,29
analysis.
3. Results
The nine themes were identified as the following factors: first trimester experience;
medical conditions; lack of physical activity; antenatal care; lack of social support; poverty
and poor nutrition; sleeping posture and hot showers; exposure to certain conditions; and
spells and curses.
3.1. First Trimester Experience
According to most of the participants, pregnancy during the first trimester period
is associated with both joy and risk. The participants reported that the usual thought of
being pregnant brings "joy" and "hope", but the experience during this period could be
challenging for many women. Participants explained that during the first trimester, the
pregnant woman is unable to eat, as she experiences general body weakness, morning sick-
ness, fevers, severe headaches, dizziness, heart palpitations, and sleeplessness. Although
these are normal, they could pose serious health risks to the woman during this period
of the pregnancy. The women described psychological problems such as fears, anxiety,
and stress that a woman could experience during early months of the pregnancy. Two
participants explained it this way:


Women 2022, 2
389
'When a woman is pregnant, she does not feel well as she used to be, the whole
experience can make you feel sick and you know, this feeling of sickness can last
during the whole pregnancy period for many women, the first three months can
be hard on you, you become anxious and afraid .
[FGD participant 1]
'In my case, I always felt like I was going to fall down in my early months. But
this feeling happens to many pregnant women, so its normal to feel that way
because your body is adjusting, it begins to go away after the third months for
most pregnant women." [Interview participant 1]
3.2. Medical Conditions
Both FGD and interview participants were of the view that complications could occur
in pregnancy when a pregnant woman already has "a pre-existing disease". They explained
that pre-existing diseases or infections such as "malaria" , "diabetes" , candidiasis ("odeepu")
or "HIV" can increase the vulnerability of a pregnant woman. This is because "it is not easy
to carry a pregnancy when you are already sick or have a disease." [Interview participant
2] Having a chronic condition
. like AIDS or sugar disease [diabetes] and becoming
pregnant could be challenging as you don't sit at home. You will need to go to the clinic
for regular and proper care." [FGD participant 2] These medical conditions could expose
the woman to the risk of experiencing a difficult pregnancy, labor, and delivery, and could
affect the baby's health as well.
According to the participants in the FGDs, other medical conditions indicating that the
pregnant woman is at risk of complications are high blood pressure, swelling in the hands
and feet, anemia, and delay in the delivery of the afterbirth or the placenta. Participants
also mentioned bleeding during pregnancy and childbirth as a major health risk for the
mother and the baby. These views were also expressed by the women in the individual
interviews, as exemplified by a personal experience of an interview participant who said:
"I don't have an easy pregnancy. My second pregnancy was the worst of all. I
had swollen feet and hands, and they [nurses] said my blood pressure was going
up at some point, and I thought those were not good signs for my pregnancy,
especially when they told me my pressure was going high and I had to come in
for regular review." [Interview participant 3]
3.3. Lack of Physical Activity
Another risk factor identified was being physically inactive during pregnancy. Ac-
cording to some of the participants, a pregnant woman who is physically inactive or does
not exercise could likewise be at risk for a difficult and prolonged labor, as explained in the
following statement by an FGD participant.
"You see, there are pregnant women who don't do any work, they don't walk,
they just sit at one place, and they stop coming to the market. But there are others
who work with their pregnancy. They go to the farm and do everything. When
you are not active, the baby will not be active. The baby cannot turn or move in
the womb, and you will have problem during delivery .
[ FGD participant 3]
3.4. Antenatal Care
Most of the participants said women who do not seek medical care or attend ante-
natal clinics could be at risk of pregnancy complications. During the FGDs, participants
recounted that a pregnant woman should seek regular health care to prevent potential
complications that could affect the pregnancy and to ensure a successful birth. A participant
in the FGDs noted, "a situation where the mother failed to seek antenatal screening for
early risk detection and treatment, it leads to conditions such as fetal malpresentation or
malposition, a critical condition for prolonged labor." [FGD participant 4]


Women 2022, 2
390
Similar views were also shared by participants in the interviews, who identified
prolonged labor as a risk a pregnant woman could be exposed to during childbirth if she
fails to attend an antenatal clinic.
3.5. Lack of Social Support
According to the participants, pregnant women who do not have adequate spousal
or family support could experience difficult pregnancy and childbirth because pregnancy
could be stressful and emotionally demanding. As a result, if the pregnant woman is
not adequately supported, it could negatively affect her health and that of the unborn
baby. Two FGD participants explained the effect of a lack of social support on pregnancy
outcomes in the quotation below.
I know a young woman that the man who made her pregnant refused to accept
the pregnancy. Her parents are not living here [referring to her community] and
she does not have any other family member in Accra here. The baby she delivered
was very small. You know ... she didn't have any support; she was always by
herself and only got a little help from neighbors and that affected the baby." [FGD
participant 5]
"Sometimes, these young mothers work long hours. The kayaye [teen girls head
porters] who are pregnant ... they carry heavy loads in the market for people
who come to shop or do groceries. They don't have their families or anybody
here to help them ... It is stressful to do this kind of job when you are pregnant
[FGD participants 6]
These findings were corroborated by the interview participants who reported a lack
of social support for young migrant pregnant women in the study area as a major risk
factor for negative pregnancy outcomes. The following remark was made by a participant
in support of this assertion, "when you go to the market right now, you see them [young
female migrant porters] carrying big bowls full of load for people with their pregnancy.
Some of them don't even know the fathers of their babies, and their parents are not here to
help them, and this is not good for the pregnancy." [Interview participant 4]
3.6. Poverty and Poor Nutrition
Poverty emerged as an important risk factor for pregnancy and childbirth compli-
cations. Both FGDs and interview participants agreed that poverty could lead to poor
nutrition among pregnant women, leading to poor pregnancy outcomes because "a preg-
nant woman should ensure she eats well, on time, and the right portions" , which is a major
problem for some women. According to the participants, some pregnant women "don't
have the money to buy enough food" and that could affect their health and the pregnancy
as well. A pregnant participant in one of the FGDs confirmed this and said, "the poor
mothers who don't have families here, their general health begins to become worse after
delivery. This is because when they go home, there is nothing there to eat and their babies
cannot grow because they don't feed them well since they themselves don't eat well". [FGD
Participant 7] According to some participants, the young pregnant migrant mothers who
lived in the study area relied on neighbors for meals when they became pregnant. One
FGD participant also put it this way:
. if they don't get this assistance, they don't eat. Some pregnant mothers eat
small portions of meal in the morning, and they don't eat until evening because
they don't have families here [Accra] and the men who made them pregnant
didn't accept the pregnancy." [FGD participant 8]
These findings were supported by some of the interview participants who said that
the young pregnant migrant mothers usually worked for long hours, carrying heavy loads
to make a living, and to save towards delivery, which exposes them to pregnancy-related
risks. The quotation below highlights this issue.


Women 2022, 2
391
'Oh, when you go there (markets) right now you will see them working in the
market, they carry loads in the market. Some sell under the hot sun [and], this is
not too good for the pregnancy, but they need the money, so they and their babies
can have food to eat the weeks following delivery." [Interview participant 5]
Furthermore, most of the participants thought that poverty made it difficult for preg-
nant mothers to attend antenatal clinics and delayed care during labor, exposing the
pregnant woman and the baby to life-threatening complications.
3.7. Sleeping Posture and Hot Showers
Both the FGDs and interview participants agreed that when a pregnant mother sleeps
on her back, it can affect the health of the mother and the unborn baby. They explained that
when a pregnant mother sleeps on her back, it obstructs the flow of oxygen from the mother
to the unborn baby, and this could be fatal for the unborn baby as well as the mother.
'This [sleeping on your back during pregnancy] is not good for your pregnancy
. when you are pregnant, you don't sleep on your back. You sleep by your side.
People (pregnant women) who sleep on their back can hurt their baby, the baby
cannot breath because air will not flow from you the mother to your baby ... so
they tell us not to sleep on our back. They are not good practice for the baby, so
you can kill your baby because the baby cannot get air from your when you sleep
on your back .
[FGD participants 9]
Some participants also reported that taking hot water showers and baths could nega-
tively affect the pregnancy. Two participants explained:
they say bathing with hot water is not good, warm water is okay ... hot
water is not good for the baby too. It can make the baby temperature go up'
[Interview participant 4]
'Bathing with hot water can make you the mother feel hot ... and you can pass
heat on to the baby in your womb, so you don't take hot showers when you are
pregnant." [FGD participants 10]
3.8. Exposure to Certain Conditions
One major perceived risk in pregnancy mentioned by the participants is the exposure
of the unborn baby to conditions that can cause the child to acquire certain health defects
such as cerebral palsy (called "asram" in the local language). This often happens if the
pregnant woman does not take "very good care" of herself and her pregnancy. For example,
if the pregnant woman does not dress well, she could expose herself and her pregnancy
(unborn baby) to individuals with such conditions. This is based on the belief that cerebral
palsy is transferrable spiritually from a person who has the condition to the mother, and
then to the baby to be born. "Asram" is a spiritual disease that can be passed on through
eye contact when a pregnant mother comes into contact with an individual who spreads the
disease. One interview participant elaborated on this perception in the following quotation.
'For a disease like asram, when you are pregnant you don't have to eat everywhere.
When some people see the pregnancy, they can transfer the disease to the unborn baby.
You have to dress decently, so that you don't expose yourself and your pregnancy.
Some people dress exposing their body when they are pregnant .
.. So when you
dress like that and you come across someone with the disease, that individual can
transfer the disease to the baby." [Interview participant 4]
Some participants also reported that cerebral palsy can kill, and that it can only be
treated with traditional or herbal medicine. For example, during the FGDs, one mother
recounted her experience with "asram", "it [asram] affected me and my baby, and I was
taken to a certain woman for herbal treatment for almost a year before my baby was 0k."
[FGD participant 11].


Women 2022, 2
3.9. Spells and Curses
392
Participants also narrated that a woman can be at risk of pregnancy complications
and/or even death if she is cursed during pregnancy. According to most FGD participants,
when a pregnant woman is disrespectful or often picks quarrels with neighbors, a curse
could be cast on her, and this may lead to stillbirth and death during childbirth. This view
was confirmed by a participant in the interviews in the following remarks:
do you know that evil people can harm your pregnancy? They can cast a curse
spell on you and your unborn baby, so the young pregnant women here who like
quarreling and fighting, some ended up having a difficulty childbirth." [Interview
participant 4]
This finding was supported by other participants who spoke of some young pregnant
mothers visiting spiritual churches to seek protection for fear the effects of curses by people
they might have wronged.
'They [young pregnant mothers] go the spiritual churches to pray for successful
pregnancy because they are afraid somebody that they have quarreled with or
disrespected might have cursed them and the pregnancy." [FGD participants 12]
4. Discussion
Although the findings from this study do not represent the views of all Ghanaian
women, they provide some insight into the general perception and knowledge of risk
factors for negative pregnancy and childbirth outcomes among women in Ghana. The
findings indicated that participants view pregnancy as an exciting and unique experience;
however, they acknowledged the risks, both medical and spiritual, associated with it. This
perception of risk could serve as a motivation for women to adopt positive health-seeking
behaviors such as attending antenatal clinics, exercising, and eating good food during
pregnancy. However, this perception of risk can also induce serious emotional experiences
such as fear, anxiety, and stress that will require both informal and professional support.
On the contrary, it seems that some women in the study area were not adequately receiving
this support during pregnancy. This might be one of the reasons why maternal health
outcomes in the study area are reported to be poor [26]. The findings of the study are
consistent with previous studies where women were found to hold such perceptions of
risks [30—32]. Anxiety and fear due to perceived risks in pregnancy and childbirth, such
as prolonged and painful labor, lack of social support, as well as economic uncertainty,
leading to stress, were identified among women in studies by Erickson et al. [33], Lyberg
and Severinson [34], and Saisto and Halmesmaki [35]. Thus, pregnancy risk perceptions
among pregnant women can affect their health and health care decisions and treatment
options [17
The findings that women perceived a lack of social support as a risk factor for preg-
nancy is relevant. As confirmed by previous studies, people with a high quality or quantity
of social networks and economic stability have a decreased risk of mortality in comparison
with those who have a low quality or quantity of social network engagement and are eco-
nomically unstable [36—38]. In pregnancy, in particular, Hotelling and colleagues [39] found
that women with continuous support, either emotionally or socially, were less likely to have
complications in pregnancy that could lead to Caesarean deliveries than those without any
support. Likewise, evidence from Ghana indicated that lack of support from friends and
extended family, being abandoned by one's husband, and being compelled to live with
unfriendly in-laws are risk factors that could expose pregnant women to psychological
problems during pregnancy [12].
Several studies have illustrated that poor women are at higher risk of food insuf-
ficiency, insecurity, and poor feeding practices, leading to malnutrition and maternal
morbidity [40—42]. Poverty hinders access to sufficient and nutritious food, and at the
same time, acts as a barrier to accessing quality and timely maternal health care [43 44
In Kenya, for example, Izugbara and Ngilangwa [45] found that poverty compelled


Women 2022, 2
393
pregnant women in slums to engage in tedious work for long hours in order to save
enough money for delivery, risking their lives. Women in our study shared similar views
regarding young migrant pregnant women who carry heavy loads and work longer
hours for a living and in preparation for delivery.
The findings showed that participants had knowledge of some common medical
risks associated with negative pregnancy outcomes in Ghana. In Ghana, like many other
tropical countries, malaria is endemic, and it is known to be a major contributing factor to
stillbirths [46,47]. Medical conditions such as diabetes, candidiasis, high blood pressure,
HIV, anemia, and delayed placenta as well as lack of physical activity are also risk factors
that were identified as dangers to pregnancy and childbirth. These findings are consistent
with a study conducted in Kenya where participants identified similar conditions as threats
to positive pregnancy outcomes [48].
Our participants had a strong belief in religious-spiritual factors such as curses as
risk factors in pregnancy. These beliefs are rooted in the community and are not only
widespread among Ghanaians, but also exist in many cultures in sub-Saharan Africa. This
belief has an influence on health care choices and decisions during pregnancy and childbirth
and motivates most women to resort to herbal medicine, spiritual care (faith healing and
prayer), or a combination of medical and traditional treatments during pregnancy [12 49].
In rural Zimbabwe, for example, it has been discovered that women fear being bewitched
because they are thought to be vulnerable to witchcraft in the early months of pregnancy.
As such, they preferred to seek protection from faith healers who are believed to possess
supernatural powers to protect them and their pregnancy [50]. Similar findings have also
been observed in studies in Southern America [51] and indigenous Pilipino in Southeast
Asia [52]. Interestingly, this notion, according to the authors, is parallel to the biomedical
perspective, which describes the early months of pregnancy as the most critical period.
Unlike in many western cultures, women in Ghana fully cover their pregnancy during the
entire pregnancy period. This practice is believed to protect the pregnancy from a curse,
spell, or witchcraft [53
5. Implications
As governments are making efforts to address the challenges of poor maternal health
outcomes, the need for research that has practical applications is essential. Our findings
revealed many issues that are relevant for maternal and child healthcare policies and
programs for low-income women in Ghana. First, the findings suggest that many pregnant
women go through psychological issues during pregnancy due to the perceived risks
associated with it. Although medical interventions such as antenatal care are important
during pregnancy, psychological support is equally important. Pregnancy induces physical
and emotional change and increases the risk of mental illness [54]. Psychological support
for women during pregnancy is therefore very important for positive outcomes. The
Ministry of Health, in consultation with other relevant stakeholders such as the department
of Social Welfare, should consider the implementation of social and emotional support
programs that can help to alleviate the emotional stress of pregnant women, especially for
poor and single women. Counseling units, specifically focusing on pregnant women, could
be set up at the maternal and childcare units of health care centers to support women who
need help.
Second, the belief that pregnant women could be cursed has implications for safe
motherhood policies and programs in Ghana. As the findings indicated, some pregnant
women use traditional medical practitioners, including faith healers, due to the belief that
they could be cursed. This does not promote safe motherhood practices and should be
addressed. Public health education must focus on explaining to women and communities
the risk and non-risk factors associated with pregnancy and childbirth, as well as correcting
misperceptions that may have a negative impact on pregnancy outcomes.
Third, the impact of poverty was a major risk factor identified by the participants.
Current socio-economic conditions in the country are having dire consequences on the poor,

394
and this could seriously affect Ghana's quest to achieve its Sustainable Development Goal 1.
Poverty among women needs serious attention through protective social interventions. The
Ministry of Health and Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection could partner
with community organizations, including churches and other religious groups, to augment
government efforts to reduce poverty among deprived communities.
6. Conclusions
The findings of the study revealed that low-income urban women in Ghana have
a wide range of knowledge and perceptions of risk factors for negative pregnancy and
childbirth outcomes. The women viewed pregnancy as a unique experience, but they
acknowledged that it could be affected by a host of medical and non-medical issues,
which could lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, including negatively affecting the health
of the mother and the baby. Though the study focused on urban women, these risk
perceptions and knowledge about pregnancy and childbirth are held by many Ghanaian
women. The findings also suggest that despite efforts being made to reduce maternal
morbidity and mortality in Ghana, many pregnant women are still at risk of pregnancy-
related complications. This study therefore brings to the fore the need to employ multiple
approaches to safe motherhood programs—social, economic, religious, and psychological—
to help poor pregnant women. While these activities will reduce barriers to quality maternal
healthcare, health education should be ramped up to address superstitious beliefs as well
as cultural misperceptions about pregnancy risk factors.

Prenatal Weight Gain and Postpartum Weight
Retention: A Delicate Balance
Everyone agrees that women are
supposed to grow larger with pregnancy,
but great controversy has surrounded rec-
ommendations for prenatal weight gain
throughout the 20th century. Forty years
ago, most American obstetricians be-
lieved that maternal weight gain caused
maternal antenatal and intrapartum com-
plications as well as obesity, and restric-
tion of prenatal weight gain to a maximum
of 15 or 20 pounds was common practice.
In 1970, the National Academy of Sci-
ences concluded that limiting maternal
weight gain was potentially harmful be-
cause it increased the risk of low fetal
birthweight and its concurrent morbidity
and mortality. For the 20 years that fol-
lowed, prenatal weight gain recommenda-
tions hovered between 20 and 27 pounds,
and research examining maternal weight
gain intensified. During this time, almost
all of the studies were desiY1ed to assess
how maternal gain related to fetal out-
come.
In 1990, the Institute of Medicine an-
alyzed the scientific evidence relating to
weight gain during pregnanø•• and formu-
lated new recommendations for healthy
gestational weight gain. 1 These guidelines,
which have been widely disseminated, are
individualized on the basis of body mass
index criteria according to the mother's
weight for height prior to pregnano'. The
specific weight-gain targets for under-
weight, normal-weight, overweight, and
obese women are 28 to 40 lb, 25 to 35 lb,
15 to 25 lb, and a minimum of 15 lb, re-
spectively. The Institute of Medicine rec-
ommendations also encourage young ad-
olescents and Black women (groups at
especially high risk for low birthweight) to
gain at the higher end of their specific body
mass index range and short women (who
may be at increased risk for fetopelvic dis-
proportion) to gain at the lower end of the
range. The development of weight-gain
recommendations based on body mass in-
dex was a result of the Institute's findin>
that the effect of a given weight gain on
fetal size diminishes as the mother's
prepregnant body size increases. The rec-
omxnendation of a range of gain, rather
than a single figure, reflected evidence that
a great variability in matemal weight gain
is observed among women with good
pregnan%' outcomes.
A major objective of these recom-
mendations is to optimize fetal birth-
weight. Although the Institute recognizes
that low birthweight is caused by multiple
factors and that maternal weight gain is
not a panacea, its recommendations are
designed to promote matemal weight gain
as one way of protecting the fetus.
Can promoting maternal weight gain
also be harmful? Determining the health-
iest matemal weight gain requires that we
consider other outcomes in addition to fe-
tal outcomes. Unfortunately, much less is
known about how prenatal weight gain af-
fects the pregnancy, labor, and delivery
experience or the long-term health of the
mother. In an attempt to address concerns
about maternal health, the authors of the
Institute of Medicine report considered
evidence that very high maternal gain in-
creases high fetal weight and its compli-
cations and may also increase postpartum
obesity. From the limited data available,
they estimated an upper limit of weight
gain. At the same time, they called for new
studies to evaluate the impact of gesta-
tional weight gain on maternal pregnan%'

outcome and maternal obesity, and they
specifically identified the need to test the
recommended weight-gain ranges against
specific pregnancy outcomes.
In this issue of the Journal, Keppel
and Taffe12 respond to this challenge.
Their analysis of selected participants in
the 1988 National Maternal and Infant
Survey suggests a strong and positive as-
sociation between prenatal weight gain
and postpartum weight retention 10 to 18
months after birth. More than one third of
the respondents reported weight gains that
exceeded the Institute of Medicine recom-
mendations, and this group retained a me-
dian of 5.6 lb; women who gained less than
the recommended amount retained a me-
dian of 1.2 lb and women who gained
within the recommended range retained a
median of 2.2, lb. When the data were ex-
amined separately by race, there was little
evidence that White women retained ex-
cess weight postpartum when they gained
within the recommended range. How-
ever, at every level of weight gain, Black
women reported retaining much more
weight than did YOIite women. For exam-
ple, when prenatal gain was below, within,
and above the recommended range, the
proportions of White women who retained
9 lb or more were 20%, 19%, and 35%,
respectively, whereas among Black
women these proportions were 29%, 45%,
and 61%.
The racial differential in weight reten-
tion among National Maternal and Infant
Survey participants was also evident in a
recent multivariate analysis that examined
risk factors for excessive retention (de-
fined as retention of at least 20 lb an av-
erage of 16 months postpartum) in women
who began pregnanø•' with a normal body
mass index.3 After controlling for a vari-
ety of potentialb' confounding variables,
the researchers found that excessive
weight retention was twice as frequent
among Black than among White mothers.
Risk factors for weight retention differed
in the two groups. For example, high par-
ity was predictive of weight retention only
for Black women and marital status was
predictive only for White women. Both
low socioeconomic status and weight gain
above the recommended range, however,
were associated with a doubled risk of
weight retention for both races.
The finding that postpartum weight
retention is relatively low in White women
who gain within the recommended range
amrms the usefulness of the Institute of
Medicine weight-gain recommendations,
at least for part of the US population. This
information can be added to other evi-
August 1993, Vol. 83, No. 8
dence suggesting that women who gain
within the recommended ranges have bet-
ter pregnang.' outcomes than do women
who gain above or below them.4S
It is not surprising that women with
large gestational weight gains will take
longer to lose weight postpartum than
those who gain less. How can we help
women to gain within the recommended
range? What should we do when it ap-
pears that a gravid woman is gaining far
more than the amount recommended? Be-
fore we allow the concept of ri$d calorie
restriction for pregnant women once more
to rear its ugly head, we should remember
that placing pregnant women on restricted
diets not only restricted fetal growth but
also created enormous stress between
women and their obstetrical caregivers 40
years ago. Yet we know that the dietary
practices and activity patterns of many
American women are not as good as they
should be.6 Perhaps the best approach at
this point is to provide individualized as-
sessment and sensitive counseling as part
of prenatal and postpartum care to en-
courage good nutrition for every woman.
Clinical guidelines to support such care
have recently been published.7
The more complicated issue is how to
interpret the finding that at any level of
weight gain, Black women retain more
weight postpartum than do White women.
A possible explanation is suggested by an-
other national survey that is reported in
this issue of the Joumal.8 Data from the
1985 and 1986 Continuing Surveys of
Food Intakes by Individuals were exam-
ined to compare reported mean enery in-
takes for women before, during, and after
pregnancy. Among the nonlactating
women, White women appeared to de-
crease their enery intake after preg-
nan"', whereas Black women reported
mean increases of 15() kcal (630 kJ) over
their prepreglant intake during the first 3
months after birth and more than 300 kcal
(1M) kJ) over their prepregnant intakes
later in the postpartum year. Thus, there is
evidence that Black women may be re-
taining weight because they are not cutting
back on their energy intake, whereas
White women are. A sunilar finding has
been reported for adult women who were
not postpartum.9
It is also possible that the racial dif-
ference in postpartum weight retention
may be attributable to problems in study
methodoloy. The cross-sectional design
of the National Maternal and Infant Sur-
vey does not allow us to know whether the
postpartum maternal weight represents
retention of prenatal weight gain or a re-
Editorials
gain of weight following an initial loss.
There are undoubtably inaccuracies in re-
called weights as a result of the retrospec-
tive data collection, and it is also possible
that there may be differential recall bias by
race. However, we cannot ignore evi-
dence that postpartum weight retention
differs by race in a nationally representa-
twe sample. We must now follow up this
finding with carefully conducted research
to examine differences in and risk factors
for postpartum weight retention in a vari-
ety of population subgroups.
As pointed out by Krieger's annota-
tion in this issue of the Journal,10 we often
devote a great deal of enery to defining
biomedical outcomes but are much less
precise and thoughtful about defining the
social factors that predict the outcomes.
As we design future studies, we should
keep in mind the fact that currently avail-
able data allow us to classify women by
race, but it is likely that race is simply a
proxy for social, economic, environmen-
tal, cultural, and other factors that influ-
ence women's health. ü

Improving Cause-of-Death Statistics: The Case of Fetal Deaths
One could say that modem public
health virtually began with the national
system of mortality statistics for England
and Wales instituted by William Farr in
1839. The vital statistics system has been
a valuable and essential public health re-
source. Over the years, the information
provided has not only enhanced our un-
derstanding of the magnitude and causes
of death and illness, but has influenced the
direction of many health initiatives. With
the advent of the Department of Health
and Human Services' Healthy People
2000 objectives (many of which are based
on health measurements of cause of death
derived from the vital statistics system),
and with the apparent federal policy of
linking these objectives to funding of pub-
lic health progams, the need for timely
vital statistics of high quality is even more
pronounced.
Recent interest in tracking health out-
comes has once again raised questions
about the reliability of cause-of-death in-
formation. Numerous articles have been
written on the subject and at least one na-
tional workshop has been held. 1-4
tions have been made about ways to im-
prove both the quality and completeness
of reporting cause of death on the death
certificate. The article by Kirby in this is-
sue of the Journal fetal deaths into
the debate.5
As a component of the vital statistics
system, fetal death reports should be
viewed as a source of information for
monitoring the health of mothers and in-
fants during the perinatal period. Many
current proposals to lower infant and per-
inatal mortality focus on preventive health
care during pregnancy' and on the problem
of preterm delivery. This focus shifts the
emphasis of research and delivery pro-
grams from intervention to prevention and
from infants to pregnancies. As the shifts
occur, we need to sharpen the distinctions
between intrapartum fetal deaths (those
that occur during labor) and late antepar-
tum fetal deaths (those that occur before
labor) and between early and late fetal
death.6
The need for reliable cause-of-death
statistics on all pregnancies in which the
1084 American Journal of Public Health
fetus was unable to survive to ftill devel-
opment is becoming more evident. Such
statistics would provide much needed in-
formation on the causes of perinatal
deaths, many of which occur before birth.
In North Carolina, for example, there
were 884 fetal deaths of 20 or more weeks'
gestation reported in 1991, compared with
733 neonatal deaths. Refining these num-
bers further, there were 1492 fetal plus
early neonatal (less than 1 week's gesta-
tion) deaths reported, compared with
deaths of infants aged 7 days or older.
The call for increased surveillance of
the causes of fetal deaths has gained mo-
mentum. In 1989, for example, the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
and the states agreed to include cause-of-
fetal-death data in the Vital Statistics Co-
operative Program contract. Soon after-
ward preliminary instructions were issued
on coding cause of fetal death and editing,
querying, and quality control of fetal death
reports. 7 A 190 NCHS survey revealed
that about 90% of the responding states
(32 out of 37) were either using the draft
procedures in 1990 or planning to use them
in 1991 (M. MacDorman, PhD, written
communication, January 7, 1992).
Concurrently with these guidelines,
NCHS commenced two evaluations re-
lated to fetal death reports. One involved
an assessment of the feasibility and cost of
querying these reports and the current
coding procedures and practices of the
various states. The second was the 1988
National Maternal and Infant Health Sur-
vey,8 which incorporated a component on
assessing the quality and completeness of
underlying data. The
results were to be used to evaluate the
feasibility of coding cause-of-fetal-death
data on the National Vital Statistics file.
The recent attention to fetal death
coding, in combination with the prelimi-
nary NCHS guidelines, has not yet re-
duced the high proportion of fetal records
with imprecise cause-of-death informa-
tion. Kirby's analysis of five states re-
vealed that the percentage of such records
ranged from 30% to 45% in the period 1985
through 1987. In the National Maternal
and Infant Health Survey,8 NCHS found
a comparable overall percentage (34%)
but much wider variance among the states
(18% to 69%). Even in North Carolina, in
which Kirby found a 37% imprecise-
record rate, significantly high proportions
of fetal reports with imprecise cause-of-
death information continue to exist. If we
apply Kirby's definitions to 1990 and 1991
records, for example, 37% and 36%, re-
spectively, of North Carolina fetal records
had imprecise cause-of-death informa-
tion.
Interestingly, about 33% of the North
Carolina fetal deaths in 1990 and 1991
were autopsied. Of those autopsied (about
300 per year), 46% had an imprecise un-
derlying cause of death. Further study is
needed to determine why more precise
causes were not listed on the fetal reports
after autopsy.
Clearly, insumcient priority has been
given to improving cause-of-death report-
ing on the fetal records. No national uni-
form coding and query rules have been
published. Implementation of the Mortal-
ity Indexing Classification and Retrieval
System (MICAR), 10-10, electronic cer-
tificates, and current vital statistics flow
procedures have preoccupied NCHS and
relegated the development of "stringent
and uniform coding, classification and
query rules" for fetal deaths to the back
burner. Kirby's study suggests, and most
would concur, that NCHS needs to move
this issue forward.
Yet one needs to question whether
the expectations proposed in the article
are realistic. Have we overstated the po-
tential of the fetal death report information
relative to the cost of additional proce-
dures? What will more accurate informa-
tion add to what we already know as a
basis for policy decisions about perinatal
programs, and is the fetal death registra-
tion system the best avenue to capture
that type of information? These poli%' is-
sues and others will need to be addressed
as we debate appropriate strategies to en-
hance the cause-of-fetal-death informa-
tion.

Gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies—a
pathology requiring treatment or a benign
physiological adaptation?

There is level-I evidence that screening for and treating gestational diabetes in singleton pregnancies reduce maternal and neonatal
morbidity. However, similar data for gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies are currently lacking. Consequently, the current approach for
the diagnosis and management of gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies is based on the same diagnostic criteria and glycemic targets
used in singleton pregnancies. However, twin pregnancies have unique physiological characteristics, and many of the typical gestational
diabetes-related complications are less relevant for twin pregnancies. These differences raise the question of whether the greater increase
in insulin resistance observed in twin pregnancies (which is often diagnosed as diet-treated gestational diabetes) should be considered
physiological and potentially beneficial in which case alternative criteria should be used for the diagnosis of gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies. In this review, we summarize the most up-to-date evidence on the epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical conse-
quences of gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies and review the available data on twin-specific screening and diagnostic criteria for
gestational diabetes. Although twin pregnancies are associated with a higher incidence of diet-treated gestational diabetes, diet-treated
gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies is less likely to be associated with adverse outcomes and accelerated fetal growth than in
singleton pregnancies and may reduce the risk for intrauterine growth restriction. In addition, there is currently no evidence that treatment
of diet-treated gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies improves outcomes, whereas preliminary data suggest that strict glycemic control
in such cases might increase the risk for intrauterine growth restriction. Overall, these findings provide support to the hypothesis that the
greater transient increase in insulin resistance observed in twin pregnancies is merely a physiological exaggeration of the normal increase
in insulin resistance observed in singleton pregnancies (that is meant to support 2 fetuses) rather than a pathology that requires treatment.
These data illustrate the need to develop twin-specific screening and diagnostic criteria for gestational diabetes to avoid overdiagnosis of
gestational diabetes and to reduce the risks associated with overtreatment of diet-treated gestational diabetes in twin pregnancies.
Although data on twin-specific screening and diagnostic criteria are presently scarce, preliminary data suggest that the optimal screening
and diagnostic criteria in twin pregnancies are higher than those currently used in singleton pregnancies.

Clinical Opinion
Introduction
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a com-
1—3
mon pregnancy complication,
affecting 6% to 10% of the pregnancies
in North America. Approximately 3
decades ago, it was questioned whether
GDM is a distinct disease that is associ-
ated with adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes to an extent that it justifies
routine screening and treatment or
whether it is, in fact, a nonentity. This
controversy has largely been resolved
following the publication of 2 large trials
that provided evidence that the diagnosis
and treatment of GDM improve preg-
nancy outcomes. However, these trials
were limited to singleton pregnancies,
and therefore, comparable data to sup-
port the benefits of screening for and
treatment of GDM in twin pregnancies
are lacking. This has been acknowledged
in a recent statement by the Society for
Maternal-Fetal Medicine on the state of
science on multifetal gestations, accord-
ing to which twins have been represented
10
in only 2% of the trials on GDM, and
this is also reflected in the lack of any
specific guidance from professional so-
cieties on the diagnosis and management
11
of GDM in twin pregnancies. Conse-
quently, the contemporary approach for
the diagnosis and management of GDM
in twin pregnancies is based on the same
diagnostic criteria and glycemic targets
used in singleton pregnancies.
However, twin pregnancies have
unique physiological characteristics,
such as a greater increase in insulin
resistance and greater nutritional
12—15
demands.
In addition, many of the
typical GDM-related complications are
much less relevant to twin pregnancies
16,17
(as discussed later).
These differ-
ences raise the question of whether the
greater insulin resistance and the asso-
ciated relative hyperglycemia observed
in twin pregnancies should be viewed as
physiological and potentially beneficial,
in which case alternative criteria should
be used for the screening and diagnosis
of GDM in twin pregnancies.
The goal of this review was to address
this question by summarizing the most
up-to-date evidence on the epidemi-
ology, pathophysiology, and clinical

consequences of GDM in twin preg-
nancies. We will also review available
data on twin-specific screening and
diagnostic criteria for GDM.

studies reported a higher incidence of
GDM in twin pregnancies,
others failed to observe such differences
(Table).
These conflicting re-
sults may be attributed to the limitations
of previous studies, including small
18,
sample sizes,
a lack of
adjustment for confounding variables
30,32
such as maternal age, obesity, and
and failure to differentiate
race,
between the type of GDM (diet-
controlled [GDMAI)] vs medically-
controlled [GDMA2] ).
In a
recent, large population-based study in
31
Ontario, Canada, women with twins
had a greater risk of GDMAI (adjusted
relative risk [aRR], 1.20; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.01—1.42) but not
GDMA2 (am, 1.07;
Based on these large-scale
findings, it was concluded that the
higher incidence of GDM in twin preg-
nancies is a consequence of a greater
predisposition for GDMAI.
What is the pathophysiology of
gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies?
The higher incidence of GDMAI in twin
pregnancies may be explained by differ-
ences in the pathophysiology of GDM.
In singleton pregnancies, GDM has been
attributed primarily to a failure of the
maternal pancreas to compensate for the
physiological increase in insulin resis-
tance in pregnancy, most likely because
of an underlying, subclinical maternal
39—41
beta-cell dysfunction (Figure l).
This mechanism is responsible for the
well-established association between
GDM and future maternal type 2
42,43
diabetes.
In twin pregnancies, a certain pro-
portion of cases of GDM may likely be
the consequence of a greater transient
increase in insulin resistance observed in
MONTH 2024
ajog.org
these pregnancies (because of the greater
placental mass and, subsequently, the
higher
levels
of diabetogenic
hormones
) in the presence of
normal beta-cell function or a lesser de-
gree of beta-cell dysfunction than that
observed in cases of GDM in singleton
pregnancies. Thus, GDM may occur in
twin pregnancies despite a pancreatic
response that would have been sufficient
to compensate for the typical increase in
insulin resistance seen in singleton
pregnancies but that is insufficient to
counteract the greater increase in insulin
resistance that occurs with twin gesta-
tions (
Figure 1). This hypothesis is sup-
ported by the observation that women
who had GDM in a twin pregnancy are
approximately 25% less likely to develop
type 2 diabetes following the index
pregnancy than those who had GDM in a
singleton pregnancy (Figure 2
Is gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies associated with adverse
pregnancy outcomes?
Regardless of the mechanisms underly-
ing GDM in twins, the question that is
most relevant for clinicians is if GDM in
twins is associated with the same com-
plications reported in singleton preg-
nancies, namely accelerated fetal growth,
macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, birth
trauma, preeclampsia, cesarean delivery,
and neonatal complications such as hy-
poglycemia, jaundice, and respiratory
48—56
morbidity.
The rationale underlying this question
is clear. Some of these complications,
such as macrosomia and shoulder
dystocia, are unlikely to be clinically
relevant for twin pregnancies given that
twin fetuses are born earlier and are
smaller on average than singleton fe-
17
tuses. Other complications, such as
preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, and
neonatal complications, are more com-
mon in twin gestations irrespective of
GDM (because of the greater placental
mass, fetal malpresentation, and higher
57—59
rates of prematurity, respectively
and thus GDM (especially GDMAI) is
unlikely to have a major impact on the
risks of these complications in twin
pregnancies.

In singleton pregnancies (upper panel), GDM has been attributed primarily to a failure of the maternal
pancreas to compensate for the physiological increase in insulin resistance during pregnancy. This
mechanism is responsible for the well-established association between GDM and future maternal
type 2 diabetes. In twin pregnancies (lower pane0, a certain proportion of cases of GDMAI may likely
be caused by the greater transient increase in insulin resistance observed in these pregnancies
(rather than from underlying maternal beta-cell dysfunction) despite an adequate pancreatic
response that would have been sufficient to compensate for the normal increase in insulin resistance
seen in singleton pregnancies but that is insufficient to counteract the greater increase in insulin
resistance seen in twin pregnancies.

Studies on the association between
GDM and adverse outcomes in twin
pregnancies yielded conflicting results
(Supplemental Table
In a meta-analysis of 13 studies on GDM
and adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies,
McGrath et a162 found that GDM was not
associated with a risk for a large for gesta-
tional age (LGA) newborn, 5-minute
Apgar score < 7, respiratory distress, or
neonatal hypoglycemia (Supplemental
Table). Accordingly, the authors
concluded that GDM is not associated with
adverse outcomes in twin pregnancies. In a
more recent meta-analysis on the associa-
tion between GDM and adverse outcomes
in singleton (n=85 studies) and twin
63
(n=27 studies) pregnancies, Greco et al
found that the association of GDM with
cesarean delivery and neonatal intensive
care unit (NICU) admission was weaker in
twin pregnancies (Supplemental Table
). In
addition, GDM in twin pregnancies (but
not in singleton pregnancies) was
4 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology
associated with a reduced risk of having a
small for gestational age (SGA) newborn
(RR, 0.89; Cl, 0.81—0.97) and of
neonatal death (RR, 0.50; 95% CI,
0.39—0.65). However, many of the studies
included in these meta-analyses were
relatively small
and did not ac-
count for confounding variables such as
60,61
maternal race
and obesity.
In
addition, most of these studies did not
include a positive control group of
singleton pregnancies (with and without
GDM) that would allow for a direct com-
parison of the effects of GDM in twin
compared with singleton pregnancies
(Supplemental Table
To address this limitation, we recently
completed a large, population-based
study from Ontario, Canada, in which
we evaluated the association between
GDM and adverse outcomes in singleton
pregnancies and, separately, in twin
64
pregnancies. In singleton pregnancies,
as expected, GDM was associated with a
MONTH 2024

range of adverse maternal and neonatal
outcomes. In contrast, in twin preg-
nancies, many of these associations were
either nonsignificant or weaker than
those observed in singleton pregnancies,
although we did identify an association
with LGA, as discussed in the next sec-
tion (
Supplemental Table). These find-
ings confirm previous observations that
GDM in twin pregnancies is less likely to
be associated with many of the adverse
maternal and neonatal outcomes asso-
ciated with GDM in singleton
pregnancies.
Is gestational diabetes in twin
pregnancies associated with
accelerated fetal growth?
We and others found that GDM in twin
pregnancies is associated with an increa-
23,63,64
sed risk for an LGA newborn,
although most studies did not distinguish
between cases of GDMAI and GDMA2.
In addition, LGA at birth is a poor mea-
sure of fetal growth because it only repre-
sents the end result and does not provide
information on the effect of GDM on
fetal growth throughout gestation.
To better understand the impact of
GDM on fetal growth in twin pregnan-
cies, we recently compared the fetal
growth patterns of twin fetuses with and
without GDM and, separately, those of
singleton fetuses with and without GDM
who underwent a total of 94,437 sono-
graphic
fetal weight
estimates
(Figure 3) .36 In singleton pregnancies,
GDM was associated with accelerated
fetal growth starting at approximately 30
weeks' gestation. In contrast, in twin
pregnancies, GDM was associated with
accelerated fetal growth only in the
subgroup of women with GDMA2 but
not in cases of GDMAI (Figure 3
In
addition, although in singleton preg-
nancies, as expected, GDM was associ-
ated with a shift to the right in the
distribution of the estimated fetal weight
percentiles (so that GDM pregnancies
had a lower proportion of small fetuses
and a higher proportion of large fetuses
(Figure 4,65 A), such a right shift was not
observed in twin pregnancies

ference between the GDM and non-

GDM during a twin pregnancy were approximately 25% less likely to develop type 2 diabetes at any
given time following the index pregnancy when compared with those who had GDM during a
singleton pregnancy (adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.65—0.90). Adapted from

GDM groups in twin pregnancies was
that in the lowest category of fetal weight
percentile, GDM was associated with a
lower proportion of fetuses with an
estimated weight < 20th percentile
(Figure 4,65 B). This latter finding raises
the question of if GDM in twin preg-
nancies may have a potentially beneficial
effect by decreasing the risk for intra-
uterine growth restriction.
Diet-controlled gestational diabetes
in twin pregnancies——physiology or
pathology?
The data reviewed above suggest that
although twin pregnancies are associated
with a higher incidence of GDMAI,
GDMAI in twins is less likely to be
associated with adverse maternal and
neonatal outcomes, is not associated
with accelerated fetal growth, and may
be associated with a reduction in the
proportion of small fetuses. Taken
together, these findings raise the ques-
tion of whether GDMAI in twin
pregnancies is indeed a pathology that
requires treatment or whether the iden-
tification and treatment of GDMAI
might lead to more harm than good.
Glycemic control in twin pregnancies
with gestational diabetes: are we
improving or worsening outcomes
In a case-controlled study entitled,
"Glycemic control in twin pregnancies
with gestational diabetes: Are we
improving or worsening outcomes," Fox
26
et al assessed the relationship between
glycemic control and pregnancy out-
comes among 66 women with a twin
pregnancy complicated by GDM. The
authors found that improved glycemic
control was not associated with a
reduction in the risk for preeclampsia
but was associated with a greater risk
of having an SGA infant. Although
this study was the first to support
the hypothesis that treatment of GDM
in twins may cause more harm than
good, it was relatively small, considered
Clinical Opinion
preeclampsia as the only potential
adverse outcome, did not stratify the
analysis by the type GDM, and did not
include a control group of twin preg-
nancies without GDM.
Therefore, we recently addressed the
same question using a larger cohort of
105 women with a twin pregnancy
complicated by GDM and a matched
control group of 315 women with a twin
pregnancy without GDM.66 The study
outcomes were a composite variable of
GDM-related neonatal morbidity (LGA,
hypoglycemia requiring treatment, jaun-
dice requiring phototherapy, birth
trauma, or NICU admission) and the
incidence of having an SGA infant. We
found that good glycemic control was not
associated with a reduction in the risk of
composite neonatal morbidity when
compared with suboptimal glycemic
control (32.1% vs 32.7%; aOR, 2.06; 95%
Cl, 0.77—5.49) (Figure 5,
A). In contrast,
good glycemic control was associated
with higher odds of having an SGA
neonate when compared with non-GDM
pregnancies, especially in the subgroup of
pregnancies with GDMAI (65.5% vs
34.0%; a0R, 4.17; 95% Cl, 1.74—10.01),
whereas the rate of SGA in GDM preg-
nancies with suboptimal control was not
significantly different than that in non-
GDM pregnancies (Figure 5,
B). In
addition, in cases of GDMAI, good gly-
cemic control was associated with a left
shift in the distribution of birth weight
percentiles, whereas the distribution of
birth weight percentiles among GDM
pregnancies with suboptimal control was
similar to that of non-GDM pregnancies
(Figure 5,
C). We concluded that in pa-
tients with GDM in a twin pregnancy,
good glycemic control was not associated
with a reduction in the risk of GDM-
related complications, but it may in-
crease the risk for SGA infants in the
subgroup of patients with GDMAI.
These findings may be attributed to the
direct effect of a lower mean blood

Diet-controlled gestational diabetes in
twin pregnancies as a physiological
exaggeration of the normal increase in
insulin resistance meant to support 2
fetuses
The observations described above
further challenge the current view that
GDMAI in twin pregnancies is a pa-
thology that merits screening and
treatment. Instead, these findings pro-
vide the basis for the hypothesis that the
greater transient increase in insulin
resistance observed in twin pregnancies,
which is often interpreted as GDMAI
based on the standard diagnostic
criteria, is merely a physiological exag-
geration of the normal increase in in-
sulin resistance observed in singleton
pregnancies designed to support the
metabolic requirements of 2 fetuses.
This hypothesis is aligned with the fact
that most of the physiological changes

of pregnancy are exaggerated in twin

compared with singleton pregnancies,
twin pregnancies are associated with a
20% greater increase in cardiac output
(60% vs 50%), a 15% greater increase in
stroke volume, and a 10% greater in-
crease in blood volume (50%—60% vs
40%—50%) to support the larger feto-
placental circulation in the presence of 2
71
fetuses, and yet, we do not treat
women with twin pregnancies with
drugs such as beta-blockers or diuretics
in an attempt to normalize their cardiac
function and blood volume, respec-
tively, to the levels observed in singleton
pregnancies. Therefore, the greater in-
crease in insulin resistance found in
twin pregnancies should perhaps also
be viewed as a physiological exaggera-
tion of the normal increase in insulin
resistance observed in singleton preg-
nancies that is meant to support 2 fe-
tuses, acknowledging that the only
problem with this specific exaggerated
MONTH 2024
physiological change is that it is detec-
ted as a pathology by the screening and
diagnostic tests for GDM that were
developed and validated in singleton
pregnancies. And if that is indeed the
case, then what is needed is to use
alternative, twin-specific screening and
diagnostic criteria for GDM in twin
pregnancies that take into account this
exaggerated physiological change?
Should we use twin-specific
screening and diagnostic criteria?
The screening 50-g glucose challenge
test
In singleton pregnancies, the sensitivity
and specificity of the 50-g glucose chal-
lenge test (50g-GCT) vary between 70%
and 88% and 69% and 89%, respectively,
when a threshold of 140 mg/dL (7.8
72,73
mmol/L) is used.
This information
is based on studies in whcih women
underwent both the screening 50g-
GCT and the diagnostic fasting oral

The distribution of fetal weight percentile in singleton (A) and twin (B) pregnancies is compared between women with GDM (dashed lines) and those
without GDM (solid lines). Fetal weight percentiles were based on the Hadlock et al , 65 1991 standard. In the singleton group, GDM was associated with a
shift to the right in the distribution curve such that GDM pregnancies had a lower proportion of small fetuses (at <20th and 20—39th percentile) and a
higher proportion of large fetuses (at 60—79th and 280th percentile) when compared with non-GDM pregnancies (A). In contrast, in twin pregnancies,
the distribution curves of the GDM and non-GDM pregnancies were similar, and there was no similar shift to the right in the distribution curve of GDM
pregnancies (B). The only significant difference in the twin group between GDM and non-GDM pregnancies was in the lowest category of fetal weight
percentile in which case GDM was associated with a lower proportion of fetuses with an estimated weight <20th percentile (P=.OI 2). Adapted from

However, similar data on the perfor-
mance of the screening 50g-GCT in twin
pregnancies are lacking. In a recent
meta-analysis on the screening accuracy
74
of the 50g-GCT in twin pregnancies,
we identified a total of 7 studies. All 7
studies were retrospective and included
information on the diagnostic OGTT
only for women with a positive screen
during the 50g-GCT.
Consequently, none of the studies (nor
our meta-analysis) could determine the
sensitivity and specificity of the 50g-
GCT for GDM in twin pregnancies. This
means that the 50g-GCT is currently
used to screen for GDM in twin preg-
nancies with the same threshold used in
singleton pregnancies despite the fact
that there are currently no data on the
screening accuracy of this test in the twin
pregnancy population.
In 1 of the 7 studies mentioned,
Rebarber et a176 found that when
compared with the
standard
threshold of 130 mg/dL used in their
practice, a higher threshold of 135
mg/dL (7.5 mmol/L) maintained the
same sensitivity but reduced the risk
for a false positive result in twin
pregnancies. The authors concluded
that in twin pregnancies, the optimal
50g-GCT threshold should be higher
than that used in singleton
pregnancies.
In a more recent, large, population-
based study from Ontario, Canada, in
which the
standard 50g-GCT
screening threshold was 140 mg/dL
(7.8 mmol/L), we compared the
screening performance of the 50g-
GCT between women with singleton
77
and those with twin pregnancies. We
found that based on the estimated
false positive rate, the optimal 50g-
GCT threshold in twin pregnancies is
higher than that in singleton preg-
nancies and should approach 148 mg/
dL (8.2 mmol/L).
The diagnostic fasting oral glucose
tolerance test
The final diagnosis of GDM is based on
the fasting 75-g or 100-g OGTT. The
optimal approach for the identification
of twin-specific OGTT diagnostic
criteria remains unclear. The most
intuitive approach is the I used in the
Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy

goal was to identify the twin-specific
OGTT thresholds based on correlation

The figure presents the relationship between the level of glycemic control and the rate of composite neonatal morbidity (LGA, hypoglycemia requiring
treatment, jaundice requiring phototherapy, birth trauma, or NICU admission) (A), small for gestational age infant (SGA), below the < 1 0th percentile (B),
and the distribution of birthweight percentiles (C). Good glycemic control (green) and suboptimal glycemic control (red) were defined as a proportion of
glucose values in target >50th percentile and f50th percentile, respectively. Good glycemic control was not associated with a reduction in the risk for
the composite neonatal morbidity (A) but was associated with a higher rate of SGA neonates when compared with GDM pregnancies with suboptimal
control and with non-GDM pregnancies (B). In addition, in cases of GDMAI , good glycemic control was associated with a left-shift in the distribution of
birth weight percentiles, whereas the distribution of birth weight percentiles among GDM pregnancies with suboptimal control was similar to that of non-
GDM pregnancies (C). Adapted from Berezowky et al.66

hypoglycemia, and preeclampsia. How-
ever, this approach was unlikely to be
feasible given the limited association of
GDM with these outcomes in twin
pregnancies as described in the previous
78
sections.
An alternative approach would be
through correlation with maternal
pathophysiology or beta-cell dysfunc-
tion. Assuming that the greater increase
in insulin resistance observed in twin
is physiological (as
pregnancies
described in the sections above), the
goal should be to avoid diagnosing
GDM in women with twins and mild
hyperglycemia solely because of the
8 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology
greater transient increase in insulin
resistance. Instead, the ideal twin-
specific criteria should diagnose GDM
only among those women with twins
with a similar degree of beta-cell
dysfunction as that observed among
women with GDM in singleton preg-
nancies (Figure 6).
We recently used the latter approach to
identify twin-specific OGTT diagnostic
criteria using a large cohort of nulliparous
women with singleton and twin pregnan-
Cies who underwent the 2-hour 75-g
79
OGTT in Ontario, Canada. Given the
challenge of measuring maternal beta-cell
dysfunction, we instead used the future
MONTH 2024
maternal risk of type 2 diabetes as a sur-
rogate outcome for maternal beta-cell
dysfunction during pregnancy given the
strong functional correlation between
these 2 observations. Using this approach,
we identified the twin-specific fasting, l-
hour and 2-hour OGTT criteria (104 g/
dL [5.8 mmol/L], 209 g/dL [11.6 mmol/L],
and 187 g/dL [10.4 mmol/L], respectively),
which were higher than the standard
OGTT criteria currently recommended for
the diagnosis of GDM by Diabetes Can-
ada80 (95 gr/dL [5.3 mmol/L], 191 gr/dL
[10.6 mmol/L], and 162 gr/dL [9.0 mmol/

This schematic figure illustrates the approach for identifying twin-specific OGTT criteria in relation to
maternal beta-cell dysfunction. Women with severe beta-cell dysfunction will develop impaired
glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus before pregnancy (blue-shaded area). In singleton
pregnancies, women with a milder degree of beta-cell dysfunction may develop GDM because of the
physiological increase in insulin resistance (red-shaded area). In twin pregnancies, because of the
greater increase in insulin resistance than in singleton pregnancies, women with an even milder
degree of beta-cell dysfunction will be diagnosed with GDM when the diagnosis is based on the same
standard OGTT diagnostic criteria used in singletons (green-shaded area and dark green boR).
However, the extra increase in insulin resistance in twin pregnancies may reflect a physiological
exaggeration of the normal increase in insulin resistance seen in singleton pregnancies meant to
support the metabolic requirements of 2 fetuses rather than a pathology that needs to be treated. In
that case, the goal is to avoid the diagnosis of GDM in twin pregnancies when the mild degree of
hyperglycemia is solely caused by the exaggerated physiological increase in insulin resistance.
Instead, the goal is to use twin-specific OGTT diagnostic criteria for GDM that would only identify
those women with twin pregnancies with a similar degree of beta-cell dysfunction that is observed
among women diagnosed with GDM in singleton pregnancies (light green boR). Adapted from

OGTT criteria in relation to future
maternal risk of type 2 diabetes) has been
used in singleton pregnancies for the
development and validation of the original
100-g OGTT diagnostic thresholds for
81
GDM by O'Sullivan and Mahan, which
were subsequently transformed to the
Carpenter and Coustan thresholds because
of technical changes in maternal blood

and are
currently used for the diagnosis of GDM in
the United States. We speculate that if
O'Sullivan and Mahan were to stratify their
original analysis by plurality, they would
have found that the OGTT thresholds were
higher in twin pregnancies than in
singleton pregnancies, similar to our
findings.
Clinical Opinion
What are the concerns regarding the
use of twin-specific criteria?
One of the main concerns regarding the
use of more liberal twin-specific diag-
nostic criteria for GDM in twin preg-
nancies is that in utero fetal exposure to
mild hyperglycemia, even if not associ-
ated with immediate neonatal
morbidity, may disrupt optimal fetal
programming and lead to long-term
metabolic complications similar to
those reported among singletons,
including childhood obesity, diabetes,
84—88
and future cardiovascular disease.
However, most data on the association
of GDM and accelerated fetal growth
with long-term morbidity in the
offspring originates from studies in
singleton pregnancies, whereas similar
long-term follow-up studies in twin
pregnancies are lacking. In addition,
even if these associations also apply to
twin pregnancies, it should be noted that
the association between deviant fetal
growth and long-term morbidity in the
offspring is more pronounced for intra-
uterine growth restriction and low birth
weight than for LGA. 89 Thus, it may be
argued that even if GDMAI is associated
with a mild degree of fetal growth ac-
celeration in twin pregnancies, the
reduction in the proportion of small
twin fetuses (who are smaller than the
average singleton fetus and are at greater
risk for growth restriction) and the po-
tential to avoid intrauterine growth re-
striction secondary to strict glycemic
control in twin pregnancies with
GDMAI may lead to an overall reduc-
tion in the long-term metabolic risk of
the twin pregnancy offspring population
(Figure 889). Still, studies on the long-
term metabolic health of twin infants
or studies that use surrogate markers for
these outcomes, such as cord c-peptide,
neonatal fat mass, and epigenetic
markers, would provide important
insight into the optimal diagnostic
threshold and glycemic targets for GDM
in twin pregnancies.
Summary
In this review, we summarized the most
recent data about the epidemiology,
pathophysiology, and clinical conse-
quences of GDM in twin pregnancies.

The incidence rate of maternal type 2 diabetes (per 1 000 person-years) was modeled as a function of the 75-g OGTT results using a multivariable
fractional polynomial regression. Models were adjusted for maternal age at the time of the index birth, ethnicity, income quintile, and fetal sex. Separate
models were developed for the fasting (A), I-hour (B), and 2-hour (C) values in twin (red dashed line) and singleton (blue solid line) pregnancies. The
dashed arrows indicate the twin-specific OGTT cutoff values associated with a similar incidence of future type 2 diabetes as that observed in singleton
pregnancies using the currently used cutoff levels recommended by Diabetes Canada for fasting. The table compares the current recommended Diabetes
79

Our main findings are as follows: (1)
twin pregnancies are associated with a
higher incidence of GDMAI than
singleton pregnancies; (2) the greater
incidence of GDMAI is likely to be
mediated by the greater transient in-
crease in insulin resistance that occurs in
twin pregnancies instead of reflecting
lower maternal pancreatic beta-cell
dysfunction and greater maternal pre-
disposition for type 2 diabetes; (3)
GDMAI is less likely to be associated
with adverse maternal and perinatal
outcomes and with accelerated fetal
growth in twin pregnancies than in
singleton pregnancies and may be asso-
ciated with a reduction in the proportion
of small infants; and (4) there is no
10 American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology
evidence that the diagnosis and treat-
ment of GDMAI in twin pregnancies is
associated with improved maternal and
neonatal outcomes; in fact, there is some
evidence that strict glycemic control in
cases of GDMAI in twin pregnancies
may substantially increase the risk of
intrauterine growth restriction. Collec-
tively, these findings support the hy-
pothesis that the greater transient
increase in insulin resistance observed in
twin pregnancies, which is often inter-
preted as GDMAI based on the standard
diagnostic criteria, is merely a physio-
logical exaggeration of the typical in-
crease in insulin resistance that occurs in
singleton pregnancies (that is meant to
support the metabolic requirements of
MONTH 2024
two fetuses) instead of a pathology that
requires treatment.
We therefore conclude that a major
priority for future funding in twin
pregnancy research is to establish twin-
specific screening and diagnostic
criteria for GDM, which can avoid the
overdiagnosis of GDM and reduce the
risks associated with over-treatment of
GDMAI in twin pregnancies. Although
preliminary data suggest that the optimal
50-g GCT screening cutoff and the
OGTT diagnostic criteria in twin preg-
nancies are higher than those currently
used in singleton pregnancies, these
exploratory, twin-specific criteria need
to be validated in adequately powered
prospective studies. Until such data

Birthweight (kg)
The figure presents the association between birthweight and the risk of type 2 DM in the offspring
based on a meta-analysis of 49 studies.89 The risk of future type 2 DM is greatest for infants with low
birth weight (especially for birth weight below 2.5 kg) and, to a lesser extent, for infants with birth
weight >4 kg. The green curve represents birth weight distribution among unselected twin infants
born at 37 weeks'gestation in a single tertiary center (Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto,
ON, Canada; n=1424, unpublished data); 27% of the twins weighed <2.5 kg, 54% weighed
2.5—3.0kg, only 1.5% weighed above 3.5 kg, and none of the infants weighed more than 3.9 kg.
The red curves represent the theoretical potential right shift in the curve in twin pregnancies with
GDM. Although such a right shift would lead to a reduction in the proportion of infants with birth
weight <2.5 kg and 2.5—3 kg (who are at an increased risk for future type 2 DM), it is unlikely to lead
to a substantial increase in the proportion of infants with birth weight >4 kg. This schematic figure
highlights the uncertainty regarding whether mild fetal growth acceleration secondary to GDM would
necessarily be harmful to the long-term health of twin infants or whether it might actually have a
beneficial role. Adapted from Knop et al.89

the screening, diagnosis, and manage-

follow the same approach currently used
in singleton pregnancies. Still, we advise

A study on referral pattern for fetal
echocardiography and identifying the various risk
factors for congenital heart defects
Abstract
Background: Fetal Echocardiography is becoming an important tool for the detection of
CHD but results can be unpredictable, depending on various factors like expertise, position
of the baby and referral indications. Various factors are associated with detection of CHD
which need further evaluation.
The present study was undertaken to study the referral pattern for Fetal Echocardiography
(FE) at a tertiary Pediatric Cardiac Centre and further to identify the various risk factors
associated with Congenital heart defect.
Results: The study was conducted on 200 consecutive pregnant women who were referred
for fetal echocardiography at Pediatric Cardiac Unit of the hospital. The mean maternal age
and the mean gestational age were 26.85 ± 4.6 years and 30.36 ± 5.14 weeks at the time of
fetal screening. On evaluating the various referral indications, gestational diabetes mellitus
was found in 55% of the study subjects, but CHD was detected in 3.6% of their fetuses.
Hypothyroidism was the second commonest indication (16.5%) among the referrals and 3%
of their foetuses were found to have CHD. The indication that accounted for the maximum
number of CHD (50%) was cardiac anomaly detected on ultrasonography, followed
by single umbilical artery, in which 33.3% of CHD was detected. CHD was however
significantly associated only with the referral indications of cardiac anomaly on USG (p
value < 0.001) and single umbilical artery (p value = 0.033). The association of the other
referral indications of the subjects was not found to be significant.
Conclusion: Majority of women referred late for the fetal echocardiography screening.
Extracardiac anomaly during second trimester scan warrants immediate fetal cardiac
evaluation.

Background
A congenital heart defect [CHD] is defined as a defect in
the structure of the heart or great vessels occurring during fetal
development.l The prevalence of CHD globally is around 8 per
thousand live births2 with a mortality of 3.9 per 100,000 population.3
Prenatal detection of CHD is of utmost importance since heart defects
are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, besides
antenatal detection helps in planning the further management. Fetal
echocardiography is becoming an important tool for screening and
can identify many structural heart diseases but it is highly variable,
depending on operator expertise, gestational age, fetal position, and
the type of cardiac defect but there is improvement in detection of
CHD lately.4 The yield of fetal echo in detection of CHD depends
not only on the expertise of the performer but also on the indication
of referral. Nevertheless its an important tool for early detection of
CHD and with the availability of newer and highly sophisticated
dedicated machines, CHDs can be detected in utero during second
trimester or even in late first trimester with a detection rate of 85—95
% in specialized units.
There are numerous risk factors associated with development of
CHD, pregestational diabetes is an important and most documented
one by various authors.S-9 American Heart Association in 2014 has
provided a list ofrisk factors for screening the high-risk mothers leading
to CHD in fetus. 6 The referral pattern for fetal echocardiography
among pregnant women is a reflection of the spectrum of women
visiting for fetal echocardiography, and it assists in identifying and for
better understanding of congenital heart defects and the risk factors
associated with it.
Methods
The aim of the study was to study the referral pattern for Fetal
Echocardiography (FE) at a tertiary Pediatric Cardiac Centre and
to identify the various risk factors associated with Congenital heart
defect.lt was a prospective observational study conducted at Pediatric
Cardiac Unit ofa University affiliated tertiary medical care facility.
Study population: The study was conducted on 200 consecutive
pregnant women who were referred for fetal echocardiography during
the study period at Pediatric Cardiac Unit of the hospital. Valid,
informed and written consent was obtained from the pregnant females
before including them in the study. The study was approved by the
Ethical committee of the Medical College.
Sampling procedure: The information was recorded in a predesigned
proforma for the profile of patients (pregnant women), indications
of referral and the risk factors (if any) associated with CHD were
identified.

anomaly on ultrasonography screening, were found to have congenital
heart defects, the maximum proportion of CHD. While one out of
three women referred with an indication of single umbilical artery was
found to have a congenital heart disease. There was one CHD (8.3%)
in each group of 12 polyhydroamnios women and 12 women with a
history of CHD in their previous child. One CHD was detected in the
fetus of one of the 23 women who had a referral indication of previous
unexplained early neonatal deaths. CHD was detected in the fetus of
four of 110 women (3.6%) with gestational diabetes mellitus. Only I
out of 33 women (3%) with hypothyroidism was found to have CHD
in their fetuses. None of the fetuses with echogenic intracardiac foci
(5), foetal bradycardia (5), and history of Down syndrome in previous
child (4) had CHD. However, six women were in the miscellaneous
group, four of whom had haemophilia A and two of whom had vitiligo.
CHD was not detected in their foetuses.
Spectrum of congenital heart disease among fetuses: Table 3
illustrates the various types of congenital heart diseases that were
found among fetuses on Fetal echocardiography. Out of I I CHDs, AV
canal defects were the most common, accounting for 36.4% ofthe total
CHDs. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) was the second most
common (27.3%) CHD detected. The distribution of single ventricle
and isolated ventricular septal defect (VSD) was equal, i.e., 18.2%.
Apart from CHDs, various other cardiac abnormalities were also
found in the fetuses on echocardiography, as depicted. A significant
tricuspid regurgitation (T R) was found in the fetuses of six women.
Five fetuses had ventricular disproportion, of which three had more
left ventricular (LV) than right ventricular (RV) disproportion. Dilated
RV was found in two women, while one had ventricular hypertrophy.
Type of congenital heart disease in each group: Different types of
CHDs were detected in the various categories of referral indications
are depicted in Table 3. In the category of gestational diabetes mellitus,
four fetuses were found to have CHDs (36.7% of all detected CHDs),
which included one AV canal defect, two HLHS, and one isolated
V SD. With polyhydramnios and single umbilical artery, one fetus in
each group was found to have CHD, which was HLHS.
Association between various factors and congenital heart
diseases: There was no significant association with the parity and
age of the mother with the incidence of CHD in the fetus (Table 4).
The association between the various referral indications and CHD is
illustrated in Table 5. As seen in the table the association between
cardiac anomaly and the presence of single umbilical artery on
Ultrasonographic screening and incidence of CHD was found to be
statistically significant (p value <0.05). The association of congenital
heart defect with advanced maternal age was also studied by
Independent samples t test but no significant difference was found
between mean maternal age of the two groups. No other referral
indication has the significant association with the CHD

Congenital heart defect is the commonest among the birth defects
affecting millions of children world wide. One-fifth of children are
likely to have significant problems that necessitate intervention in the
first year of life.10 CHD is a major and fast-growing health issue for
children worldwide. Because of the severity of disease, which affects
the quality of life, early detection is a important in order to implement
early intervention. 11 A study conducted by Bhambani in which 1445
fetal echo were performed, of which 1183 women had no risk factor
associated with CHD. A total of 76 (52.6 per 1000) fetuses were found
to have some cardiac abnormality of which, 12 (8.3 per 1000) had
CHD. In our study II fetuses (5.5%) were found to have CHD while
14 fetuses (7%) were found to have functional cardiac abnormalities.
While another study from Northern India found incidence of CHD as
15 per 1000.12,13
In a recent study by Qiu X and coworkers] 4 evaluated fetal
echocardiography of 67,834 pregnant women in which 1492 fetuses
were found to have CHD. Prenatal genetic examination on amniotic
fluid and cord blood, revealed chromosomal abnormalities in 20.43%
of foetuses with CHD. Hence, they recommended interventional
prenatal genetic evaluation for fetuses with CHD, to rule out the
chromosomal abnormalities.
A cross-sectional study on one hundred and one pregnant
women in Egypt was done15 to determine the clinical utility of fetal
echocardiography (FE). They performed FE and detected congenital
heart defects (CHDs) in 34.6%, of which complex cardiac lesions
that were diagnosed, included common atrioventricular canal, cardiac
masses, fetal arrhythmias and cono-truncal anomalies. Later, they
performed postnatal transthoracic echocardiography on neonates
and concluded that fetal echo can accurately diagnose majority of
the complex lesions, but can miss few critical defects like aortic
coarctation.
A retrospective analysis on fetal echocardiography of 1262
fetuses16 studied various referral indications like abnormal anatomy
scans, maternal medical disorders, family history of CHD, and fetus
growth restrictions. They reported CHD in 22.7% of the fetuses. They
also performed prenatal invasive testing and reported chromosomal
abnormalities in 55% of the CHD-detected foetuses. In their study,
they concluded that most CHDs occur during pregnancy even without
any underlying prenatal risk factor, emphasising the importance of
routine foetal echocardiography scans and finding the association
between CHD and chromosomal abnormalities in fetuses.
In our study, the majority of referrals had a primary indication as
gestational diabetes mellitus (55%). However, only 4% of them were
detected to have CHD in their fetuses, and the association between
gestational diabetes mellitus and CHD detection was not found to be
statistically significant (p value = 0.201). Also, 5% of the referrals
had pregestational DM but none of their fetuses were found to have
CHD in them. Øyen et al.,17 did a cohort study of two million births
over 34 years and found a four-fold increase in the risk of CHDs
in maternal pre-gestational DM (both types I and 2). In a systemic
review, Depla et al.,18 found that maternal diabetes (Pregestational and
gestational) is associated with fetal cardiac hypertrophy, ventricular
diastolic dysfunction, and overall impaired myocardial performance.
This observation in our study is different from other studies where
majority of CHD is diagnosed in mothers with diabetes, this might
be due to small sample size and association may be detected if we
had enrolled more numbers of mothers with diabetes especially with
pregestational diabetes.
The second most common primary indication among referrals was
hypothyroidism (16.5%) and CHD was found in 3% of their fetuses.
Although the association between hypothyroidism and the detection
of CHD was not found to be significant enough (p value = 0.496).
However, a study by Grattanet showed CHD in 11.3% of fetuses of
mothers having hypothyroidism, suggesting a significant correlation
between maternal hypothyroidism and the development of CHD in
the fetus.
Total of 6% of the women were referred with the indication of
polyhydramnios. 8.3% of their fetuses were found to have CHD
and the association was not significant (0.657). Polyhydramnios

ABSTRACT
Background: Women with disabilities have the same rights as women without disabilities to prevent
unintended pregnancy, yet little is known about their experiences in accessing family planning methods.
Objective: This qualitative descriptive study explored perceptions of barriers to effective family planning
services among women with disabilities.
Method: Semi-structured, open-ended interviews were conducted with 31 women with diverse dis-
abilities as part of a larger study investigating risks and facilitators of unintended pregnancy among
women with disabilities across the United States.
Results: Analysis revealed multiple barriers experienced by women with disabilities in accessing effec-
tive family planning services needed to prevent unintended pregnancy. Barriers included physical or
system barriers, financial limitations, and nonresponsive healthcare providers. Women also identified
difficulties in finding appropriate family planning methods, both related and unrelated to disability.
Conclusions: This is the first in-depth exploration of barriers to accessing family planning services and
challenges to finding effective family planning options among women with disabilities. The findings
underscore the need for targeted interventions, improved provider training, and policy changes to
optimize reproductive healthcare, improve access to family planning services, and prevent unintended
pregnancy among women of childbearing age with diverse disabilities.
The rate of unintended pregnancy is an important benchmark of
a population's reproductive health as it reflects the ability of
women and couples to achieve their reproductive goals. Nearly
45% of pregnancies in the United States (U.S.) are unintended, a

rate substantially higher than many other industrialized nations.
Women experiencing unintended pregnancies are more likely to

unintended pregnancy as compared to White women and in-
dividuals with higher incomes in the U.S.
Less studied is unintended pregnancy among women living
with disabilities. Nearly 12% of U.S. women of childbearing age live
13
with a disability. Women with disabilities are increasingly
becoming pregnant, and may be as likely to become pregnant as
women without disabilities. Further, women with disabilities are
as likely to report wanting to have a child as women without dis-
15
abilities, yet less certain about future pregnancy intentions. Few
studies have examined unintended pregnancy among women with
disabilities. Using Pregnancy Risk Assessment and Monitoring
System (PRAMS) data from Rhode Island, researchers found women
with disabilities were significantly less likely to intend to become
pregnant than women without disability. More recently, using
data from the 2011—2013 and 2013—2015 waves of the National
Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), significant differences in preg-
nancy intention were noted by disability status. Specifically, a

higher proportion of pregnancies were unintended among women
with disabilities as compared to women without disabilities (i.e.,
53% vs. 36%, respectively), and women reporting an independent
living disability had the highest proportion of unintended preg-
nancies (62%). An examination by disability type revealed signifi-
cantly higher adjusted odds of unintended pregnancies among
women with hearing disability, cognitive disability and indepen-
dent living disability than for pregnancies among women without
disabilities (aOR 1.5—1.9).17 Yet, the reason for these disparities
remains largely unknown. Using NSFG data, researchers examined
population-based estimates of use of family planning services
among women of reproductive age. Findings revealed women with
disabilities were less likely to receive any family planning services
than women without disabilities, and these disparities were most
pronounced in women reporting low education, low income, and
unemployment. Additional analyses revealed among women ages
25—44, those living with disabilities were significantly less likely to
have received a method of birth control, or birth control counseling
in the previous twelve months as compared to those without a
18
disability.
There is a growing body of literature demonstrating substantial
inequities in the quality of healthcare received, including experi-
encing stigma and bias, among women with disabilities. Much of
this literature is focused on experiences during pregnancy with less
recognition of the critical importance of the preconception period
and its influence on subsequent pregnancy outcomes. The quality
of care women with disabilities experience, outside of pregnancy
care, may be associated with an increased risk of unintended
pregnancy. In a qualitative study of women living with spina bifida,
women reported having a poor understanding of their pregnancy
potential, in part due to insufficient information from healthcare
19
providers. Another qualitative study, focused on women living
with disabilities who experienced reproductive coercion, found
20
that health care providers rarely screened for violence, a known
20,21
risk factor for unintended pregnancy. Attitudes and practices of
neurology providers regarding sexual and reproductive healthcare
for their adolescent and young adult patients with epilepsy were
recently explored, with results demonstrating wide variability
among practitioners. With regard to reproductive goals, one
physician noted telling a patient not to "... get pregnant until you're
like 30" and another physician describing telling women not to get
pregnant until they are transferred to adult neurology and then the
22
discussion can ensue regarding reproductive goals. Ensuring ac-
cess to effective family planning methods is critical to preventing
unintended pregnancy, particularly for women with disabilities
who may face unique barriers to care. Thus, the purpose of the
current study was to explore perceptions of barriers to family
planning services among women living with disabilities.
Methods
The current study reports the qualitative findings of a mixed
method parent study that examined risks and protective factors for
unintended pregnancy among US women living with diverse dis-
abilities, including those with hearing disability, vision disability,
cognitive disability mobility disability, self-care disability, and in-
dependent living disability. The quantitative aims of the parent
study utilized data from two waves of the NSFG, while the quali-
tative aim explored women's experiences with reproductive health
care, as well as the context of their unintended pregnancies. Eligi-
bility for participation in the qualitative aim, reported here,
included women between the ages of 18 and 44 who experienced
an unintended pregnancy after the onset of a disability, experi-
enced an unintended pregnancy within the prior two years, and
reported the presence of a disability for at least two years at the
Disability and Health Journal 14 (2021) 101055
time of data collection. Women were excluded if they were unable
to answer simple questions demonstrative of understanding of the
informed consent, did not understand or express themselves in
English or American Sign Language, lived in a nursing home or
other institution, reported severe misuse of alcohol or other drugs,
or expressed suicidal ideation. The study was approved by the
University of Virginia Institutional Review Board.
Given our goal to explore the experiences of women living with
diverse disabilities across the US, we used multiple dissemination
methods to reach our population of interest. Primary dissemination
methods included social media, including Facebook groups and
individual social media platforms of individuals actively engaged in
the disability community, disability-related websites, and
community-based organizations. Our study included a community
advisory board (CAB) comprised of nine individuals who identified
as women living with diverse disabilities, living in different areas of
the US. Our CAB was instrumental in our recruitment efforts, using
their well-established networks to disseminate study-related
information.
The qualitative aim of the parent study included 31 women
living with a disability. Four women were excluded due to having a
planned pregnancy (n 1) or the onset of a disability after expe-
riencing an unintended pregnancy (n 3). The individual, in-depth
interviews were guided by a semi-structured interview guide
which was developed by the study team in conjunction with our
CAB. The interview guide drew upon findings generated from
38-40
quantitative findings in the parent study.
Areas of exploration
included participants' knowledge of family planning options,
health care providers' advice around family planning, and their
perceptions on unique risks for experiencing an unintended
pregnancy.
Data collection
The first author, who has extensive clinical and research expe-
rience working with women with disabilities, conducted all of the
interviews in English over the phone, and three participants used
telephone relay services for interview completion. Phone in-
terviews were necessary given this was a national sample. On
average, the interviews lasted 1 h. Prior to beginning each inter-
view, participants were reminded that they could skip or refuse to
answer any questions. For participants who agreed to have in-
terviews recorded the interviewer reminded them that the
recording be turned off during any portion of the interview. Addi-
tionally, each participant was given a code word prior to the start of
the interview that they could use if they felt that their privacy was
in jeopardy given the sensitive nature of the topic. Our safety plan
included thanking the participant for her time and ending the call
with the understanding that the participant would re-contact the
interviewer at her convenience when her privacy could be main-
tained if the code word was used. This was not necessary in any of
the interviews conducted. Three participants asked that their in-
dividual interviews not be recorded though allowed ample time for
the interviewer to record comprehensive notes.
Data analysis
Twenty eight of the 31 interviews were audio-recorded in full
and transcribed verbatim. The three remaining interviews included
comprehensive notes regarding the interview, including direct
quotes where appropriate. ATLAS.it software was used to assist in
the organization and management of data. Two authors (JA, TB)
analyzed transcripts using a thematic analysis approach, which
started with an immersion in the participants' experiences, and the
development and refinement of a codebook, which included

deductive codes derived from the interview guide as well as
23,24
inductive codes constructed from the transcripts.
To ensure
consistency of findings, an audit trail was maintained for trans-
parency in the analytic phase. During regular meetings with the
study team, codes were collapsed, refined, and removed, as
appropriate, and any discrepancies in coding were discussed and
resolved via consensus. The first two authors organized interview
text pertaining to the experience of unintended pregnancy into
themes and subthemes, and matrix analysis was used to identify
25
similarities and differences among participants. The entire study
team reviewed and refined themes and subthemes during research
meetings. As a final step, the first author reviewed each transcript
to ensure that appropriate coded exemplars were included in the
analysis, and that appropriate themes had been identified.
Using this thematic analysis approach, we identified two major
themes including barriers to accessing family planning, and the
unique considerations regarding family planning for women living
with disabilities. With regards to barriers to accessing family
planning, subthemes included barriers related to physical or sys-
tem, financial, and healthcare provider.

just over half of participants (n — 17) identified as Non-Hispanic
White, 35% (n

(n — 3) identified as "Other." Most participants reported being
unemployed (n — 18), and over half (n — 17) reported a total
household income less than $30,000 per year. All participants
identified as heterosexual.
Barriers to accessing family planning
The first major theme related to disabled women's experiences
with family planning relates to the substantial, and numerous,
barriers to access that participants had to overcome to obtain
reproductive health care. With one exception, all participants re-
ported barriers to obtaining family planning services, and these
barriers were associated with an increased risk of experiencing an
unintended pregnancy. Categories within this theme include
physical and financial barriers, and healthcare providers who fail to
address disabled women's reproductive healthcare issues or even
seemingly to recognize that they have need of such care.
Physical or system barriers: "kind of normal and natural in my
world"
Participants spoke poignantly about physical or system-level
barriers to care specific in accessing family planning services.
Inaccessible medical equipment such as a lack of accessible exam
tables or wheelchairs to assist with longer distances (e.g., from
parking lot to clinic) as well as more system-level barriers were
experienced by many. One participant reported having to meet her
health care provider in an emergency room or obstetrical ward for
even routine care, remarking "I've never been able to access care in
the same manner that other women would." The clinic where her
provider saw patients did not have an accessible exam table for
routine examinations. Several other women relayed experiences of
having to obtain "routine" care in "non-routine" settings due to
accessibility issues. These additional complexities in accessing care
often resulted in delayed or missed appointments with one
participant noting "I should have had them...l didn't want to go
through the hassle. I've probably done them less frequently than
recommended." A Deaf participant faced challenges in obtaining
adequate information on birth control because poorly skilled or
unavailable interpreters added an additional barrier to navigate.
She remarked, "the doctor didn't really explain all the other options
to me. . I think if the interpreter that had been there had been
doing a better job and was more interactive and more clear, I would
have known and it just would have been more accessible infor-
mation and then I could have made a better choice." She further
described that she stopped her birth control method due to
breakthrough bleeding and was not aware of other options.
A subtler physical barrier to care was that women were often
dependent on caregivers to take them to appointments or assist
with transfers. During adolescence and young adulthood, these
caregivers were often parents, and thus conversations around
sexual activity and the potential for family planning options could
not freely be discussed. A woman with a spinal cord injury
described how she felt her mother's presence at her appointments
kept her from being able to talk openly about her sexual health,
recounting "I was so dependent on her after my accident.. .she had
to drive me everywhere. When I wanted to have my first [gyne-
cological] exam, she had to help me onto the exam table and she
stayed in the room and everything. So, in a way, she had control
because she had to be there if I wanted to receive care." Similarly,
another young woman living with multiple sclerosis was accom-
panied to her appointments by her mother. While she wanted to
ask her healthcare provider about family planning options, she was
3

not comfortable doing so in front of her mother, remarking "so I
guess that was definitely a barrier. I couldn't get the information I
needed, and that's how I ended up pregnant." Similar experiences
were described by multiple other participants; that is, wanting to
have open conversations with health care providers, but in private,
without a family member present.
Financial limitations: "often times, I don't come up with the money"
Over half of study participants reported significant financial
challenges, which also presented barriers to obtaining recom-
mended reproductive health care. As one participant said,
another thing is the cost of these medications. If you want an IUD
it's very expensive so, and who knows how the insurance is going to
change when it comes to birth control." Financial barriers led
another participant to use a less effective birth control methods
(i.e., withdrawal). She remarked, "I'm sexually active and well, I
haven't gone through her yet because I do have a co-pay to go see
her and often times, I don't come up with the money to see her."
Similarly, another woman reported becoming pregnant soon after
giving birth when she could not afford to attend her six-week
checkup. More than half of study participants reported living on
per year total household income, and as one participant
stated "when it comes to choosing groceries or co-pays, I have to
choose food." A substantial number of participants also identified
obstacles including significant delays in finding a healthcare pro-
vider who could attend to their reproductive health needs given
their disability. Participants perceived these delays were exacer-
bated by a shortage of health care providers who accepted their
insurance (i.e., Medicaid). One participant who had recently moved
to a new town described significant delays in attempting to obtain
an intrauterine device. She recalled "by the time I found someone
who was comfortable treating me [living with spinal cord injury]
they saw me and said I needed to come back to have the IUD. .1've
always felt like having Medicaid and this disability is, it's like a
double whammy." She went on to describe feeling "judged" in
many of her encounters with the health care system due to
Medicaid, and that having Medicaid limited her options in health
care providers who were willing to care for her. This experience of
feeling judged based upon payer status was shared by several other
participants. Ultimately, she experienced an unintended pregnancy
due to delays in finding a healthcare provider with whom she was
comfortable receiving care.
Healthcare providers: "it was the silence around the topic that was
most telling"
All participants were asked about their experiences with
healthcare providers in discussing, and accessing family planning
options to prevent an unintended pregnancy. While few partici-
pants were actively discouraged from being sexually active by
healthcare providers, many perceived that their providers were
highly "reluctant" to raise the issue during the health care
appointment. Some participants found healthcare providers quick
to assume that they were not in need of contraception as adoles-
cents. One participant with a physical disability recounted seeing
her family physician before she went to college, and her mother
being in the exam room. She described the encounter with her
physician, recalling "she was like going down this checklist, and I
remember her clicking through and going 'well, you're not sexually
active so that's a no."' Most of the participants who were older, and
in some cases had already experienced an unintended pregnancy,
reported that their providers also failed to address the topic. Par-
ticipants very clearly felt this was due to their disability. As one
participant said, "It's the truth. She [provider] absolutely didn't talk

to me about it.. .because of my disability. Another said, "I guess [she
didn't talk about contraception] because of my disability. She had
seen me for like the last five years and it never came up. It was like
that whole section was just skipped over." Some participants dis-
cussed having never had a sexual history taken or had a provider
ask about their family planning needs. A participant who used a
wheelchair due to a spinal cord injury noted, "no one ever asked if I
wanted to be pregnant or if I didn't want to be pregnant." Another
participant who was Deaf remarked "I did go to a GYN almost every
year because I knew I was supposed to but it was never brought
up." Participants often attributed this to a view of women with
disability as asexual. A participant living with multiple sclerosis
remarked, "persons with disabilities are special, but not in special
way. People don't think we're interested in sex, or maybe it's that
who would be interested in having sex with me?" A participant
with a spinal cord injury described her experience in discussing
family planning options noting, "it was more like she didn't believe
because I have a disability that I could have intercourse. So she
wasn't too worried about it, even though I actually expressed my
concerns about it. [she was] definitely dismissive." Another added
"there was also this underlying assumption that it [contraception]
was only to help with my periods, like, I'd never need it for birth
control that question never, ever came up. Yeah, no one has ever
asked me if I was sexually active."
When asked what they knew about contraception prior to
experiencing an unintended pregnancy participants reported a
range of knowledge and any unique considerations given their
specific disability. For those participants who were older, some
described being "placed in separate classrooms" as school aged
children for the "birds and the bees" talk, now recounting that the
discussions were "more focused on anatomy than anything else."
Younger participants described largely turning to family, friends or
social media for information. Overall, participants felt supported in
their discussions with family and friends, and rarely were partici-
pants discouraged from being sexually active or using contracep-
tion. Those who were discouraged from using contraception as
adolescents or young adults (n
6) were most commonly
discouraged because of concerns from family members about po-
tential side effects of varied methods. With few exceptions, the
majority of participants did not receive information during
adolescence and young adulthood about reproductive health care
needs from a health care provider unless they initiated the
conversation.
Finding what works for me
The second major theme was related to difficulties participants
experienced in finding family planning options that worked for
their individual needs.
Like women without disabilities, many participants struggled to
find a family planning method that worked for them and that they
liked. The information under this theme reflects those struggles
and the factors that influenced participants' experience with family
planning, including side effects and problems with methods, both
unrelated and related to disability. Many participants perceived
providers were often not helpful in providing them with guidance
in navigating their challenges with methods.
Women with disabilities in this study often encountered the
same kinds of challenges with contraception that women without
disabilities typically report. For example, participants experienced
side effects like weight gain, mood swings, or diminished sex drive
from hormonal methods, or had difficulty remembering to take oral
contraceptives. For some, typical side effects (e.g., fatigue, dimin-
ished desire) were particularly difficult to manage in the context of
disabilities that were already causing such symptoms. For others,
4

the side effects impacted them more severely because of their
disabilities. One participant shared, "The reason I was concerned
about my weight gain with different options was because of my
disability. I struggle with mobility as it is and so I have to really be
careful about anything that could cause me to gain weight...it
would wear on my shoulders to push myself if I got heavier and
transferring would be harder." Many had to try multiple methods
because of side effects that were more problematic given their
disability. One participant with a physical disability noted, "I got on
the pill and I did fine until I'd been on it for about six months and I
noticed I started gaining weight, having horrible headaches, having
horrible mood swings, and it was just awful and I couldn't tolerate
it and so we tried a diaphragm.... [later] I had decided to get my
tubes tied because I did have one abortion and it haunted me."
For some participants, their specific disabilities affected their
physiologic responses to contraception, thus limiting their options.
For example, one participant with a genetic metabolic condition
reported an idiosyncratic reaction to an injectable contraceptive
that caused her to gain a large amount of weight and resulted in
hospitalization. Participants with mobility issues (e.g., paraplegia)
were unable to safely use hormonal methods due to poor circula-
tion and an increased risk of blood clots. One participant described
her challenges when her provider recommended a NuvaRing given
her concerns of not wanting something she had to take every day.
She remarked I couldn't use [the ring] because I can't bend with my
back to insert that in and I know people who have mobility issues,
that bending to insert that would be impossible for them too."
Several participants described wanting to explore an intrauterine
device (IUD) as an option given their desire for menstrual man-
agement or suppression as well as desire for a method without
estrogen due to its association with an increased risk for throm-
bosis. Participants with mobility limitations described not being
able to tolerate the positioning required for IUD insertion yet op-
tions to have this done under anesthesia were not discussed.
Several participants with weakness or limited use in their upper
or lower extremities felt their options were quite limited and did
not perceive providers to be sensitive to these needs. The providers
often offered little information and few options, leaving partici-
pants to feel they had been left alone to identify alternatives when a
particular method did not work for them. As one said, "it's almost
like it was my problem to deal with, not theirs." Another participant
with a cognitive disability remarked that she had difficulty
remembering to take her birth control pills. When she broached the
topic with her provider, she said "she didn't offer anything. She told
me for it to be effective I needed to take it every day which I knew,
but just wasn't good at remembering. I knew there might be some
other options but it was "this is your option, take it or leave it.'
Another participant with a physical disability reported, "it was like
she wasn't interested in talking about it. She had made her
recommendation and it didn't work so that was that." Minimizing
menstruation was a particularly important consideration for par-
ticipants with limited mobility. One participant who self-
catheterized hoped that minimizing her periods would decrease
her frequent urinary tract infections. Another reported, "periods
were also harder for me because I can't stand to clean myself up and
so absolutely, I was looking for an option that would not make me
gain weight and that would cut back on my bleeding substantially."
Discussion
The reproductive health needs of women living with disabilities
14,26
have largely been ignored.
Unintended pregnancy is regarded
as a key indicator of women's autonomy and control over their
reproductive health, and is a marker widely used in policy and
program planning. Limited research demonstrates that rates of
Disability and Health Journal 14 (2021) 101055
unintended pregnancy are higher among women with disabilities,
who are also disproportionately poor, less educated, and racial and
ethnic minorities reflecting both historical harms and existing
inequities.
The barriers that women with disabilities face in accessing
family planning are substantial. In this study, most participants
identified the combination of financial restriction and health in-
surance limitations as a barrier to accessing optimal reproductive
services and family planning options. Overcoming this inequity
barrier will involve solutions such as greater employment oppor-
tunities, equal pay, and attitudinally and physically accessible work
environments for women with disabilities as well as comprehen-
Sive health insurance reform. Many of our participants also
described physical barriers which either precluded or delayed ac-
cess to care. Improving access to care will require elimination of
such barriers. A study examining physical access barriers found that
44% of gynecological practices were deemed inaccessible to women
27
with disabilities. Despite the passage of the Americans with
Disabilities Act thirty years ago, women with disabilities continue
to experience barriers in accessibility. Many of our participants
discussed examination tables being a limiting factor to care. The
U.S. Access Board established standards for accessible equipment,
including adjustable height examination tables, yet widespread
28
adoption of these standards has not occurred. Women living with
disability are more likely to be poor, and many of the participants in
this study had Medicaid. While Medicaid is meant to increase ac-
cess to care, for participants in this study, it was often perceived as
"yet another barrier." Other research, in women without disabil-
ities, has found that Medicaid recipients often experience

tive care, delays in seeking care, and lower quality of care.
While the experience of stigma was not a central purpose of the
current study, our findings suggest it may be an important risk
factor for unintended pregnancy for women living with disability of
reproductive age.
Beyond physical and financial barriers, women experienced
negative and nonresponsive encounters with healthcare providers,
many of whom treated them with negative attitudes or frank
dismissal of their reproductive health care needs and parenting
desires. The large majority noted that discussions around fertility
desires occurred only if the women raised the issue, and even then,
some women felt "judged." In a qualitative study of pregnant
women with physical disabilities, women perceived being treated
as "less than normal," and in some cases feeling viewed as a
33
"problem" by their clinicians. A patient-centered approach is key
to optimizing reproductive choices. It is important for clinicians to
recognize that women with disabilities are fully sexual beings with
the same range of fertility and parenting desires and concerns as
their able bodied peers. Addressing sexuality and contraception is
an essential part of the clinical encounter. This is particularly salient
for women with disabilities who have been historically regarded as
asexual.
Assessing fertility goals and contraceptive counseling are dis-
cussions that must occur in a patient-centered approach to opti-
34
mizing reproductive choices.
Engaging women in such
discussions is increasingly recognized as key public health strategy
to decrease rates of unintended pregnancy. Indeed, the American
Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), along with a
number for health care organizations, advocates for "reproductive
life planning" in health care settings, recognizing its role in
reducing unintended pregnancy, improving maternal health, and
35
pregnancy outcomes.
Family planning presents unique considerations for women
living with disabilities. Despite recent research showing the ther-
apeutic benefit and safety of levonorgestrel IUD use in young adults

Reproductive Health in
the Time of COVID
Jennifer Berglund
IN SPRING 2020, the pandemic began shutting
down the world—restaurants, colleges, even entire
cities felt emptied and closed. A cloud of uncertainty
lingered over most parts of the world and altered our
daily schedules and tasks. But for a wide segment of
society, it wasn't the toilet paper, or the masks, or the
isolation from their families that hurt the worst—it
was the sudden uncertainty around one of the most
fundamental aspects of our lives: reproduction.
Quite suddenly, with the onset of the pandemic,
this process, already fraught with dangers and ques-
tions and challenges, became infinitely more so.
Hard data was already scarce in an active, novel
pandemic, and for pregnancy, even more so. In
some cases, the answer became delay or cancel any
family plans. Birth rates, already on the decrease,
abruptly plummeted in the United States. According
to a recent survey by the Guttmacher Institute, 34%
of American women have either delayed their plans
to have a child or reduced the number of children
they expect to have as a result of the pandemic [1].
For those who elected to move forward, they
faced an environment of heightened risk. Rates of
maternal deaths, stillbirths, ruptured ectopic preg-
nancies, and maternal depression shot up around
the world during the pandemic [2]. Health offi-
cials are scrambling to understand if this is directly
related to the virus, or just a byproduct of a global
health care system stretched to the brink. In the
meantime, both women and men, intentionally and
not, continue to make and have babies, navigating
the winding path of conception, pregnancy, and
birth, all in an active pandemic. However, there are
still many more questions and few certainties when
it comes to nurturing new life.

Making babies
One of the more intriguing questions about the
COVID-19 pandemic is the fact that from the start, it
has hit men harder than women. Maleness is, in fact,
the leading risk factor for both contracting the virus,
and developing severe illness once infected [4]. This
is due to the prevalence ACE2, a protein found on
the surface of many types of cells that acts as the
receptor for COVID-19's spike protein. Though ACE2
is found in both men and women, a lot of it is found
in the testes, more, in fact, than in any other organ,
male or female [3]. That has reproductive health
specialists concerned that the virus might impact
sperm production [4]. In fact, COVID-19's viral
cousin, SARS, or SARS-CoV, is known to cause wide-
spread damage to both the sperm and testes when it
invades, causing severe inflammation and cell death
[5], and aside from that, it isn't unusual for sperm
production to suffer during a fever-inducing illness.
Sarah Vij, a urological surgeon and male fertility
specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland, OH,
said that recently ill men are routinely advised not to
undergo fertility treatments due to inevitable drops
in sperm counts (Figure 1). Anecdotally, she said,
"I've seen two patients
and my partner has seen
one who were recover-
ing or recently infected
with COVID who had no
sperm in their ejaculate,"
she said, but it's unclear
whether or not this is a
prolonged issue or merely
temporary. The data sim-
ply do not exist to suggest
either way.

Similar increases have been seen throughout the
world [10]. The massive influx of severely ill COVID
patients has also pushed pregnant women in these
areas out of the hospital, limiting their access to
critical prenatal care, leading to thousands of
deaths that would have been avoided under differ-
ent circumstances [10]
Protecting babies
Early in the pandemic it was unclear if women
could transmit the virus to their babies during
pregnancy, or at birth. Perhaps out of an overabun-
dance of caution, the initial policy in China was for
a newborn to be immediately removed from a COV-
ID-mother and then kept in isolation for as long as 14
days without breastmilk. "That draconian process
was not something any of us wanted to replicate,"
said Puopolo, "but we were in an evidence-free zone."
Prior to the pandemic, Puopolo had been work-
ing on a study investigating immunity transfer from
mother to child for Group B Streptococcus, one of
the leading causes of sepsis in newborns. By com-
paring antibody levels in the umbilical cord blood of
newborns to those in the mother's blood, they could
get a pretty good idea of the rate of transfer from the
mother through the placenta. When the pandemic
hit, it was easy to adjust their protocol to test for
those antibodies instead. "As newborn providers,
we wanted a way to tell a woman she doesn't have to
worry anymore," she said, "if you have to tell a family
with a new baby that everybody has to wear a mask
and wash their hands, and nobody can come over
and nobody can help you take care of that baby,
there are a lot of really terrible practical implications
of this virus for pregnant women in new families."
They also hoped that with the rapid development of
vaccines, this might help them get a general idea as
to whether properly timing a vaccine during preg-
nancy might help confer immunity to the fetus.
Puopolo and her colleagues collected blood from
1471 mothers and their baby's umbilical cords and
tested them both for antibodies. Eighty-three of the
mothers tested positive for COVID antibodies, and
72 of their babies showed antibody levels at least
as high or higher than their mothers [11]. "What our
work established was that these antibodies are trans-
ferred, they appear to be transferred with a timing
that is relatively rapid relative to when the woman
gets the disease," said Puopolo. And furthermore,
the data suggest that the earlier a mother is infected,

well be an optimal time to
vaccinate the mother. "Of course, this isn't the only
thing an obstetrician has to think about when coun-
seling a patient," said Puopolo, "but we now at least
have some information to provide to care providers
about the best time during pregnancy to immunize."
This presumes a pregnant mother even can get
immunized. Vaccine safety in pregnant women has
been slow to come. That's because, historically, preg-
nant women have long been excluded from clinical
trials to protect both mother and child from ill effects.
Sadly, in the case of the pandemic, this left one of
the most vulnerable populations without basic safety
information. Fortunately, that is all finally beginning to
change. Formal clinical studies with pregnant women
for both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are cur-
rently underway, and preliminary data on more than
35,000 people showed no obvious safety issues from
those vaccines in pregnant women [12]. It remains
unclear if other vaccines, particularly those that are
more widely available outside of the United States,
like Covishield from AstraZeneca and Covaxin, are
safe for pregnant women, leaving many expectant
mothers at risk.
Life prevails
If there can be said to be a gift in this pandemic, it
is in how relatively less it affects children—and that so
far has appeared to extend to infants born over the last
year. Though there have been documented cases of
newborns being infected after birth, the CDC and the
American Academy of Pediatrics say this is unlikely.
Only 2%—4% of newborns test positive for the virus in
the few days after birth, and those that do don't get
especially sick. Generally, all of them are born to moth-
ers who are acutely ill, and likely weren't sick enough
during pregnancy to pass along immunity.
"When I think back to how worried we were at the
beginning of the pandemic," said Valerie Flaherman,
associate professor of Pediatrics and Epidemiology
and Biostatistics at the University of California San
Francisco Medical Center (Figure 3), "there were
so many things about COVID that were difficult to
understand, and we were all really worried the babies

would have a lot of deleterious impacts." Flaherman,
in a study looking at babies born to infected women,
found that, "in general, the babies did well." But, she
said, we have yet to see comprehensive data from
babies born to women infected early in pregnancy.
Other viruses, like Zika and Rubella, are known to
cause severe birth defects and perhaps even cog-
nitive, behavioral, and psychiatric disorders that
may not be obvious until later in life [13]. "Most of
the time," said Puopolo, "the issues with all of these
viruses occur during a very narrow period early in
pregnancy where there's very rapid organ develop-
ment in the baby." It's still too early to know if the virus
is capable of similar effects—something Flaherman is
currently investigating.
THOUGH MUCH HAS been learned in these pandem-
ic-laden months, there are still merely hints and clues
about the effects of COVID-19 on reproductive health.
And for some, there is no time to waste. "My experi-
ence is when it comes to fertility, patients do not want
to wait," said Vij. Her practice never really slowed
down, even at the height of the pandemic.

Greater risk of type 2 diabetes progression in multifetal
gestations with gestational diabetes: the impact of
obesity
ajog.org

BACKGROUND: The relationship between gestational diabetes mel-
litus and adverse outcomes in multifetal pregnancies is complex and
controversial. Moreover, limited research has focused on the risk of
gestational diabetes mellitus progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus
specifically in multifetal pregnancies, resulting in conflicting results from
existing studies.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the risk of gestational diabetes
mellitus progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus between singleton and
multifetal pregnancies in a large cohort of parturients with a 5-year
follow-up.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study was conducted on a pro-
spective cohort of pregnant individuals with pregnancies between January
1, 201 7, and December 31, 2020, followed up to 5 years after delivery.
Glucose levels during pregnancy were obtained from the Meuhedet Health
Maintenance Organization laboratory system and cross-linked with the
Israeli National Diabetes Registry. The cohort was divided into 4 groups:
singleton pregnancy without gestational diabetes mellitus, singleton
pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus, multifetal pregnancy without
gestational diabetes mellitus, and multifetal pregnancy with gestational
diabetes mellitus. Gestational diabetes mellitus was defined according to
the American Diabetes Association criteria using the 2-step strategy.
Univariate analyses, followed by survival analysis that included Kaplan-
Meier hazard curves and Cox proportional-hazards models, were used
to assess differences between groups and calculate the adjusted hazard
ratios with 95% confidence intervals for progression to type 2 diabetes
mellitus.
RESULTS: Among 88,611 parturients, 61 ,891 cases met the inclusion
criteria. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 6.5% in the
singleton pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group and 9.4% in
the multifetal pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus group. Partu-
rients with gestational diabetes mellitus, regardless of plurality, were older
and had higher fasting plasma glucose levels in the first trimester of
pregnancy. The rates of increased body mass index, hypertension, and
earlier gestational age at delivery were significantly higher in the gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus group among patients with singleton pregnancies
but not among patients with multifetal pregnancies. Survival analysis
demonstrated that gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with
adjusted hazard ratios of type 2 diabetes mellitus of 4.62 (95% confidence
interval, 3.69—5.78) in singleton pregnancies and 9.26 (95% confidence

Stratified analysis based on obesity status revealed that, in parturients
without obesity, gestational diabetes mellitus in singleton pregnancies
increased the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus by 10.24 (95% confidence
interval, 6.79—15.44; P<.OOI) compared with a nonsignificant risk in
multifetal pregnancies (adjusted hazard ratio, 9.15; 95% confidence in-
terval, 0.92—90.22; P=.059). Among parturients with obesity, gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus was associated with an increased risk of type 2
diabetes mellitus for both singleton and multifetal pregnancies (adjusted
hazard ratio, 3.66; [95% confidence interval, 2.81—4.67; P<.OOI] and

CONCLUSION:
singleton pregnancies, gestational diabetes mellitus in multifetal preg-
nancies doubles the risk of progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus. This
effect is primarily observed in patients with obesity. Our findings under-
score the importance of providing special attention and postpartum follow-
up for patients with multifetal pregnancies and gestational diabetes
mellitus, especially those with obesity, to enable early diagnosis and
intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitus.

maternal age. GDM in singleton preg-
nancies is firmly linked to short-term
risks, such as accelerated fetal growth
and macrosomia, and long-term risks,
such as the potential development of

metabolic syndrome.
The incidence of GDM in multifetal
pregnancies is higher than in singleton
pregnancies, probably because of
increased placental mass and placental
hormone levels. However, the associa-
tion between GDM and perinatal adverse
outcomes in multifetal pregnancies is
complex and conflicting. GDM compli-
cations that are seen in singleton preg-
nancies may be increased in multifetal
pregnancies, regardless of GDM (preterm
7—10
birth or hypertensive disorders),
or
could be of less relevance in multifetal
pregnancies (macrosomia or shoulder
dystocia). 5 11 Concerning fetal growth,
several studies indicated that GDM in
multifetal pregnancies is less likely to be
associated with accelerated fetal growth.
Moreover, some researchers proposed
that the fetal effect of mild hyperglycemia
associated with GDM could play a

Why was this study conducted?
This study aimed to evaluate the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)
progression to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) between singleton and multifetal
pregnancies in a large cohort of parturients with a 5-year follow-up.
Key findings
The prevalence of T2DM was 6.5% in the singleton pregnancy with GDM group
and 9.4% in the multifetal pregnancy with GDM group. GDM doubled the risk of
progression to T2DM in singleton pregnancies compared with multifetal preg-
nancies (adjusted hazard ratio: 4.62 vs 9.26; P<.OOI for both). Stratified analysis
based on obesity status revealed that, in pregnant individuals without obesity,
GDM elevated T2DM risk by 10.24 in singleton pregnancies and insignificantly
elevated T2DM risk in multifetal pregnancies. However, in pregnant individuals
with obesity, GDM raised T2DM risk by 3.66 in singleton pregnancies and 9.31 in
multifetal pregnancies.
What does this add to what is known?
This study unveils the complex effect of GDM in multifetal pregnancies. In
pregnant individuals without obesity who carry multifetal pregnancy, GDM did
not substantially increase the risk of progression to T2DM, raising a possible need
to individualize the diagnostic criteria and glucose target levels for GDM in
multifetal pregnancies. Conversely, the risk ofT2DM was Considerably higher in
pregnant individuals with obesity who carry multifetal pregnancies and develop
GDM, than in pregnant individuals with obesity who carry singleton pregnancies
and develop GDM, suggesting that this population may require special attention
and follow-up after delivery, to facilitate early diagnosis of T2DM.
protective role, potentially reducing the
risk of placental insufficiency and fetal
growth restriction in multifetal pregnan-
cies. This implies that GDM treatment in
multifetal pregnancies may not improve
12—16
neonatal outcomes.
The pathophysiology of GDM is
thought to involve preclinical prepreg-
nancy pancreatic ß-cell dysfunction,
which, in turn, accounted for the
higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes
18—22
mellitus (T2DM) after delivery.
Therefore, pregnant individuals with
GDM are recommended to undergo a
postpartum glucose tolerance test (GTT)
and subsequent follow-up. In multifetal
pregnancies, the pathophysiology of
GDM is uncertain. Although some sug-
gest that increased GDM is due to
increased placental mass, leading to
higher levels of diabetogenic hormones,
such as human placental lactogen and
23
steroidal hormones, others contend
that the diabetogenic effect of hyper-
placentosis in multifetal pregnancies is
counterbalanced by greater glucose up-
24
take of the increased fetal mass. This
perspective presents GDM as somewhat
physiological in multifetal pregnancies.
Moreover, data on the risk ofT2DM after
GDM is conflicting, with only a few
studies comparing the progression
of GDM to T2DM in singleton vs mul-
tifetal pregnancies yielding opposing
25—27
results.
If the risk of progression to
T2DM is similar to that of singleton
pregnancies, this supports the idea that
GDM, even in multifetal pregnancies, is
pathologic.
Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the
risk of GDM progression to T2DM be-
tween singleton and multifetal preg-
nancies in a large cohort of parturients
with a 5-year follow-up.
Materials and Methods
This was a retrospective analysis of pro-
spectively collected data aimed to eval-
uate the risk ofT2DM development after
multifetal pregnancies complicated by

GDM. The local institutional review
board committee (REBA 0-18-08-21)
approved the study. Because of the
retrospective nature of the study,
informed consent was waived.
Study population
Here, our data were derived from an
extensive dataset composed of 5 years of
laboratory data, which were collected by
the Meuhedet Health Maintenance Or-
ganization (HMO). This dataset was
cross-referenced with a pregnancy reg-
istry to ensure glucose results during
pregnancy. Last, the dataset was inte-
grated with the Israeli National Diabetes
Registry (INDR) to evaluate the risk of
T2DM. Meuhedet is one of the 4 state-
mandated health funds that Israeli resi-
dents must belong to under Israel's
universal healthcare framework. The
dataset included all pregnant individuals
with documented pregnancy (by preg-
nancy registry) with last menstrual
period (LMP) between January 1, 2017,
and December 31, 2020. Maternal data
included maternal age, body mass index
(BMI), and diagnosis of hypertension,
and delivery data included gestational
age at delivery and neonatal sex. All
clinical data were retrieved from the
parturient electronic medical records at
the time of pregnancy, and BMI was
calculated according to maternal weight
and height measured at the first medical
encounter during pregnancy. Laboratory
data included first-trimester fasting
plasma glucose levels, 50-g glucose
challenge test (GCT), and 100-g oral
glucose tolerance test (OGTT) values.
T2DM diagnosis was retrieved from the
28
INDR. As previously described, since
2012, all health medical organizations in
Israel are requested by law to report all
cases of diabetes mellitus (DM) to the
INDR. Data in this registry were linked
to the pregnancy registry and the
laboratory data of Meuhedet. The INDR
is automatically updated daily by the
HMO according to the patient's labora-
tory data.
For this analysis, we included all
pregnant individuals without a previous
diagnosis of DM and delivery of at least
I live-born child. For pregnant in-
dividuals with more than 1 pregnancy

Definitions
By convention and according to Israeli
guidelines, all parturients are recom-
mended to undergo fasting plasma
glucose level in the first trimester of
pregnancy to exclude overt DM (>125
mg/dL), followed by the 2-step approach
for GDM diagnosis. A 50-g screening
GCT is recommended at 24 to 28 weeks
of gestation, and for the screen-positive
parturients ( > 140 mg/mL), a diag-
nostic, 3-hour, 100-g OGTT is per-
formed. Pregnant individuals with DM

risk factors, such as BMI of >30 kg/m
previous GDM, previous macrosomia,
or strong family history of T2DM, are
advised for direct OGTT instead of GCT.
Abnormal OGTT values are defined ac-
cording to the Carpenter-Coustan diag-
nostic thresholds of serum glucose
concentration: 295 mg/dL (5.3 mmol/
L) in the fasting state, 2180 mg/dL (10.0
mmol/L) at I hour, 2155 mg/dL (8.6

mmol/L) at 2 hours, and 2140 mg/dL
(7.8 mmol/L) at 3 hours, when GDM
diagnosis requires at least 2 of 4

abnormal values.
For the INDR, DM is defined as
meeting one or more of the following
criteria: (1) glycated hemoglobin level of
26.5% (47.5 mmol/ mol), (2) serum
glucose concentrations of 2200 mg/dL
(11.1 mmol/L) in 2 tests performed at
an interval of at least 1 month, and (3)
23 purchases of glucose-lowering

Obesity was defined as a BMI of 230
kg/m2. Hypertension was defined as hy-
pertension diagnosis before pregnancy.

Statistical analysis
The study cohort was divided into 4
groups, singleton pregnancies with
GDM, singleton pregnancies without
GDM, multifetal pregnancies with
GDM, and multifetal pregnancies
without GDM.
At first, we performed univariate
analysis to compare maternal character-
istics, plasma glucose values, and
outcomes between groups. Maternal
age and BMI were evaluated both as
continuous variables and as categorical
variables (with a cutoff of 35 and 40 years
for age and 30 kg/m2 for BMI). Glucose

levels, gestational age at delivery, and
time to follow-up were treated as
continuous variables, whereas hyper-
tension, GDM, neonatal sex, and T2DM
were treated as categorical variables.
Categorical variables were compared
using X tests, and the Kruskal-Wallis
test was used to assess differences for
continuous variables. All the tests were
2-tailed, and was considered sta-
tistically significant. For comparisons
between groups, we used the I-way
analysis of variance with Bonferroni
correction.
Next, we computed the Kaplan-Meier
hazard curves for the OGTT results and
used Cox proportional-hazards models to
estimate the adjusted hazard ratios
(aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals
(CIS) for the incidence of T2DM over
follow-up time using the singleton preg-
nancies without GDM as the reference
group with adjustment to confounders.
Because of the high effect of obesity on
31
T2DM, we repeated the last analysis for
pregnant individuals with and without
obesity (BMI of 230 kg/m2).
Results
During the study period, 88,611 partu-
rients were recorded into the database.
After exclusion (overt DM, no live birth,
and no GCT or OGTT data), 61,891
cases met the inclusion criteria and
entered analysis (Figure 1). Of the cases,
1115 (1.8%) were multifetal pregnan-
cies, and 60,776 (98.2%) were singleton
pregnancies. Stratified to groups, there
were 59,017 pregnant individuals
(97.1%) in the singleton pregnancy
without GDM group, 1759 pregnant
individuals (2.9%) in the singleton
pregnancy with GDM group, 1062
pregnant individuals (95.2%) in the
multifetal pregnancy without GDM
group, and 53 pregnant individuals
(4.8%) in the multifetal pregnancy with
GDM group. In a 5-year follow-up, the
rates of T2DM were 6.5% in the
singleton pregnancy with GDM group
and 9.4% in the multifetal pregnancy
without GDM group (P=.4).

older and had higher levels of fasting
plasma glucose in the first trimester of
pregnancy. The rates of increased BMI,
hypertension, and earlier gestational age
at delivery were significantly higher in
the GDM vs no GDM groups in
singleton pregnancies but not in the
multifetal pregnancy groups.
Levels of fasting plasma glucose, GCT,
and all 4 OGTT values were significantly
higher in the GDM groups than in the
no-GDM groups in singleton and mul-
tifetal pregnancy groups. Interestingly,
in patients without GDM, GCT levels
were significantly higher in the multi-
fetal pregnancy group than in the
singleton pregnancy group. In patients
with GDM, there was no difference be-
tween the singleton and multifetal
pregnancy groups in patients' de-
mographics or glucose levels, except for
higher gestational age at delivery for
singleton pregnancies.
In the univariate analysis of a 5-year
follow-up, for each year, the rates of
T2DM were higher in the GDM groups
than in the no GDM groups, for both
singleton and multifetal pregnancy
groups. However, there was no signifi-
cant difference between the singleton
pregnancy with GDM group and the
multifetal pregnancy with GDM group
and between the singleton pregnancy
without GDM group and the multifetal
pregnancy without GDM group.
Table 2 and Figure 2 demonstrate the

T2DM. We compared all 4 groups
adjusted for age, hypertension, and BMI
of 230 kg/m2, with singleton pregnancy
without GDM considered as the refer-
ence value. GDM increased the risk of
T2DM by 4.62 in singleton pregnancies
and by 8.43 in multifetal pregnancies
(P<.OOI for both).
Similarly, we further analyzed the
groups by performing the survival anal-
ysis separately for singleton and multi-
fetal pregnancies (Table 3 and Figure 3
We found that GDM in multifetal preg-

on T2DM risk, we performed Cox re-
gression analysis separately for singleton

Comment
Principal findings of the study
Here, we aimed to compare the risk of
GDM progression to T2DM between
singleton and multifetal pregnancies.
Our main findings were as follows:
l. Compared with GDM in singleton
pregnancies, GDM in multifetal
pregnancies doubles the overall risk
of developing T2DM within 5 years.
2. In parturients without obesity, GDM
in singleton pregnancies increases the
risk of developing T2DM in 5 years
by 10.2, whereas in multifetal preg-
nancies, GDM does not elevate this
risk significantly.
3. For parturients with obesity, we
observed that GDM in multifetal
pregnancies resulted in a 2.5 times
higher risk of developing T2DM than
GDM in singleton pregnancies.
Results in the context of other
studies
Few studies have evaluated the associa-
tion between GDM and adverse out-
comes in multifetal pregnancies, yielding
conflicting
results.
More specifically, to the best of our
knowledge, the progression of GDM to
T2DM in multifetal pregnancies was
25—27
addressed in only 3 studies.
Hiersch
27
et al evaluated 75-g OGTT results for
singleton and twin pregnancies and
showed that the incidence of T2DM was
lower for pregnant individuals with a
twin pregnancy for any given OGTT
value, indirectly suggesting that GDM in
twins was less associated with T2DM.
Similarly, using a large Canadian data-
base, Retnakaran et a126 demonstrated
that the risk of GDM progression to
T2DM was lower in pregnant individuals
with twin pregnancies than in those with
singleton pregnancies. Conversely, Cai-
25
mari et al demonstrated similar rates of
GDM progression to impaired glucose

tolerance or T2DM between singleton
and multifetal pregnancies. The dis-
crepancies between our study results and
those of Hiersch and Retnakaran could
be attributed to several factors. First,
both Hiersch and Retnakaran employed
a 75-g OGTT. Previous research has
indicated that the use of a 75-g OGTT
leads to a 2-fold increase in the diagnosis
of GDM while maintaining a similar rate
35
of adverse outcomes. This may lead to
overdiagnosis of GDM in their cohorts,
which could potentially have a substan-
tial effect on the study results. Caimari
et a125 used 100-g OGTT but with the
36
National Diabetes Data Group criteria.
Second, we conducted separate analyses
for singleton and multifetal pregnancies,
employing a multivariate approach that
adjusted for potential confounders. Un-
like the studies by Hiersch and Retna-
karan, our cohort was stratified for
maternal BMI, which differed from
previous studies, a factor we found to
have a substantial role in the progression
of GDM to T2DM in multifetal preg-
nancies. This distinction is noteworthy,
particularly when considering that in the
25
study by Caimari et al, where the me-
dian BMI was 23 kg/m2, and similar to
our findings, the authors did not observe
a significant difference in the progres-
Sion of GDM to T2DM in pregnant in-
dividuals without obesity.
Clinical implications
Our study demonstrates that the risk of
GDM progression to T2DM is doubled
in multifetal pregnancies with GDM
compared with singleton pregnancies
with GDM. Furthermore, our results
highlight a substantial difference be-
tween parturients with and without
obesity.
In pregnant individuals without
obesity who carry multifetal pregnancy,
GDM did not markedly increase the risk
of progression to T2DM. Although
limited by sample size, this finding is in
line with results of previous studies
showing that GDM in multifetal preg-
nancies is less likely to be associated with
13—16
accelerated fetal growth,
implying
that some degree of hyperglycemia
in multifetal pregnancies could be

considered physiological. Consistent
with studies showing a higher rate of
small-for-gestational-age fetuses in well-
controlled GDM in multifetal pregnan-
12
cies, and considering the fact that the
studies by Carpenter-Coustan excluded
multifetal pregnancies, these findings
suggest a possible need to individualize
the diagnostic criteria and glucose target
levels for GDM in multifetal pregnancies.
Conversely, although it is well estab-
lished that pregnant individuals with
GDM have a high risk of progression to
18—22
T2DM after delivery, it seems that
pregnant individuals with obesity who
carry multifetal pregnancies and develop
GDM represent a special population
with an even higher risk of DM in the
future. This heightened risk may be
attributed to a combination of risk
factors, including advanced maternal
age, polycystic ovary syndrome, and the
need for assisted reproductive tech-
niques with increased estrogen levels, all
linked to both multifetal pregnancies
and T2DM. In parturients with obesity,
excessive adiposity may promote a
proinflammatory state and insulin
resistance, which contribute to both
37
GDM development and later T2DM.
Previous studies that evaluated combi-
nations of risk factors and future DM
demonstrated that GDM alone had a
comparable risk of T2DM, such as hav-
ing 2 risk factors, such as obesity or
38
postdelivery weight retention. Hence,
we suggest that pregnant individuals
with obesity and multifetal pregnancies
complicated by GDM may require
tailored postpartum interventions,
including access to dietitians, regular
follow-ups, and, for those at the highest
risk, options, such as metformin or
bariatric surgery to facilitate early diag-
nosis of T2DM.
Research implications
The first research implication is the need
to develop OGTT thresholds for the
diagnosis of GDM in multifetal preg-
nancies, based on the risk of developing
T2DM and stratified for pregnant in-
dividuals with and without obesity. Next,
these thresholds will need to be evalu-
ated for association with adverse peri-
natal outcomes.
Strengths and limitations
Our study strengths include our large
cohort with a diverse population. Within
Meuhedet HMO, the current de-
mographic makeup of women is
composed of approximately 35% Or-
thodox Jewish individuals, 20% Arabs,

individuals, underscoring the substantial
diversity within our study population.
The results were adjusted for multiple
confounders, including maternal BMI.
This adjustment is particularly impor-
tant as BMI plays a crucial role in the
progression to T2DM and postpartum
care, and pregnant individuals with
obesity are advised to undergo DM
screening irrespective of their history of
GDM status. Our data are based on an
automatic laboratory database, cross-
tabulated with a validated, daily upda-
ted pregnancy registry, integrated with
the INDR. Last, we used only 1 preg-
nancy per patient, which prevents se-
lection bias for high parity parturients.
Study limitations mainly derive from
its retrospective nature. Several key fac-
tors were absent from our dataset,
including maternal parity, family history
of DM, hyperlipidemia, and gestational
weight gain. In addition, data on po-
tential postpartum interventions, such
as weight loss or bariatric surgeries, were
not available for analysis. The absence of
parity data, along with our strategy to
include each woman only once in the
analysis, limited our ability to assess the
potential influence of multifetal
pregnancy exposure as a confounding
factor. Regrettably, we did not perform a
power analysis before commencing the
research, and the registry that we used
had a limited existence of only 5 years,
lacking long-term data beyond that
period. Although our initial cohort was
large, it is essential to note that only a
small subset of pregnant individuals with
multifetal pregnancies were affected by
GDM, potentially influencing our sta-
tistical results. Statistical significance
should be interpreted cautiously
considering the sample size variation
between groups.
In addition, our study is limited by the
INDR's lack of differentiation between
type I DM and T2DM. Recent research in
Israel highlighted this nonspecificity, and
although the effect of type 1 DM on our
results is expected to be minimal, it re-
39
mains a limitation. The registry's reli-
ance on the criterion of 23 purchases of
glucose-lowering medications to indicate
T2DM is another inherent limitation.
Although this criterion has a high sensi-
tivity and positive predictive value, it may
not definitively distinguish DM-related
use from other indications. Previous
studies evaluating the reliability of the
registry have reported a sensitivity of 95%
40
and a positive predictive value of 93%.
Moreover, the inclusion criteria
restricted our study to patients with live
births, potentially affecting the results.
The inclusion of triplet pregnancies,
although few and without cases of DM, is
another aspect to consider. Finally, our
study was conducted in one of Israel's 4
HMOs, which may raise concerns about
the generalizability of our results. How-
ever, it is crucial to recognize that all
citizens, regardless of ethnicity or reli-
gious affiliation, are mandated to be
affiliated with one of these HMOs under
Israeli law. Meuhedet HMO's nation-
wide presence and the freedom for
citizens to switch between HMOs
contribute to maintaining a broadly
representative study population, en-
hancing the potential applicability of our
findings to a broader context.
Conclusion
We found that GDM in multifetal preg-
nancies has a 2-fold increased risk of
progression to T2DM after delivery
compared with GDM singleton preg-
nancies, especially in patients with
obesity. We believe that these patients

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background: Chronic arsenic exposure has been associated with pregnancy complications and reduced fetal
growth in populations where total arsenic exposure exceeds 50 gg/L. However, the potential effect on pregnancy
outcomes remains unclear at lower levels of arsenic exposure, such as those most commonly observed in the
United States.
Objectives: We evaluated the associations between arsenic exposure during pregnancy with fetal growth and risk
of pregnancy complications using data from mother-infant pairs participating in the National Children's Study.
Methods: Prenatal arsenic exposure was measured using maternal urine collected during the third trimester.
Information about pregnancy complications was abstracted from medical records. Fetal growth, including ge-
stational age, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and ponderal index, was ascertained through
physical measurement at birth and extracted from medical records.
Results: Medians [interquartile range (IQR)] of maternal urinary total arsenic and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)
were 7.77 gg/L (7.98) and 3.44 gg/L (3.13), respectively. Each increase in IQR of prenatal total arsenic level was
associated with greater birth length (+0.28 cm; 95% CI: 0.14, 0.42), greater head circumference (+0.12 cm;
95% CI: 0.04, 0.21), and lower ponderal index (—0.37 kg/m3; 95% CI: —0.58, —0.17). Similar results were
obtained for levels of prenatal DMA. Tests for multiplicative interaction indicate that prenatal urinary DMA was
negatively associated with gestational age among female infants (—0.44 week decrease in gestational age es-
timated for each IQR increase in DMA; 95% CI: —0.84, —0.05), while no association was observed among male
infants (p
= 0.02). No significant associations were detected between arsenic and birth weight or
i nterac tio n
pregnancy complications.
Conclusions: Higher prenatal arsenic exposure was associated with longer birth length, greater head cir-
cumference, and lower ponderal index. Associations between arsenic and gestational age may be modified by
infant sex.
Naturally occurring arsenic in the earth's crust leads to widespread
human exposure. Arsenic-contaminated drinking water is the major
pathway of exposure (Chung et al., 2014), but arsenic exposure through
occupation, diet, and air pollution can also lead to clinically significant
exposure in populations with no known water exposure (Bulka et al.,
). Chronic exposure to arsenic is linked with
2017; Meharg et al., 2009
numerous detrimental health outcomes, including cancers (skin, lung,
liver, bladder, kidney, and prostate), skin lesions, cardiovascular dis-
ease, respiratory disease, and diabetes mellitus (Abdul et al., 2015;
Mauli et al., 2012; Moon et al., 2012;
Rahman et al., 2009b,
MM
Sanchez et al., 2016).
Pregnant women and their offspring may be particularly susceptible
to the toxic effects of arsenic exposure due to changes in hormone levels
of pregnant women and hemodynamics associated with pregnancy, and
the immature immune system, rapid differentiation, and tissue/organ
growth of developing fetuses (Cunningham et al., 2010
). While it is
known that arsenic exposure to a pregnant woman transfers to the
developing fetus (
Concha et al., 1998; Hall et al., 2007
), there is
growing consensus among the existing evidence to indicate that arsenic
exposure affects fetal growth. Four recent systematic reviews evaluated

existing epidemiologic evidence for the effects of arsenic exposure on
birth weight (Bloom et al., 2014; Milton et al., 2017; Quansah et al.,
2015; Rahman et al., 2017
): two conclude that there is limited evidence
of a negative relationship between arsenic exposure and birth weight
(Bloom et al., 2014; Rahman et al., 2017); one meta-analysis reports a
significant reduction in birth weight in relation to arsenic exposure
based on four studies (Quansah et al., 2015); the fourth concludes that
evidence of such an association is convincing, specifically for higher
levels of arsenic exposure ( > 50 ppb) (
While other
Milton et al., 2017
fetal growth-related measures (i.e., birth length, head circumference,
and ponderal index) have been studied (Bermudez et al., 2015; Bloom
et al., 2016; Chou et al., 2014; Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016; Henn
et al., 2016; Laine et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2018
), evidence for an effect
of arsenic exposure on birth length, head circumference, and ponderal
index is inconclusive. Similarly, arsenic exposure may exert a role in the
development of pregnancy complications (e.g., gestational diabetes and
preeclampsia) (Farzan et al., 2016; Marie et al., 2018; Peng et al.,
), which, in turn, may increase later-life risks of adverse health
2015
outcomes such as type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic disease (Baz
et al., 2016; Bellamy et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2014; Murphy and Smith,
). However, epidemiologic research evaluating these associations
2016
is limited.
Most previous epidemiologic studies on arsenic exposure and ma-
ternal and child health were performed in populations with higher le-
vels of arsenic exposure, such as those found in Bangladesh and Mexico
(Laine et al., 2015; A Rahman et al. 2009a). Few studies have evaluated
these relationships in regions (e.g., United States and Canada) with
lower levels of water arsenic (Ettinger et al., 2009; Gilbert-Diamond
et al., 2016). Although the public health implications are large, it re-
mains unclear whether results based on populations receiving high-
level arsenic exposures are relevant to populations receiving low- or
moderate-level arsenic exposures.
Here, we sought to understand the impacts of arsenic exposure
during pregnancy on fetal growth and risk of pregnancy complications
in a population of pregnant women with levels of exposure that are
typical in the United States using data from a cohort of mother-infant
pairs who participated in the National Children's Study (NCS).
2. Methods
2.1. Study population
Participants included for analysis are women and children enrolled
in the Initial Vanguard Study of the NCS. Information regarding re-
cruitment of women is detailed elsewhere (
Stanford et al., 2015). The
Initial Vanguard Study was conducted in seven primary sampling units
(i.e., Queens County, New York; Montgomery County, Pennsylvania;
Waukesha County, Wisconsin; Brookings County, South Dakota, and
Yellow Medicine, Pipestone, and Lincoln counties, Minnesota; Orange
County, California; Salt Lake County, Utah; Duplin County, North
Carolina) using a geographically based probability sample design from
January 2009—September 2010. According to estimates from the United
States Geological Survey, the groundwater in each of these counties is
estimated to contain less than the US Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) limit of 10 gg/L of arsenic (
Ayotte et al., 2017; EPA, 2001).
In order to be included in the study, the following eligibility criteria
needed to be met: household screening performed during or before the
woman's pregnancy, current pregnancy or high probability of preg-
nancy, and ability to grant informed consent; 618 mother-infant pairs
met these criteria and were enrolled in the study. Enrolled women
completed up to two pregnancy visits that consisted of extensive in-
terview, self-administered questionnaires, a physical examination, and
biospecimen (blood and urine) and environmental sample collections.
Since the purpose of the Initial Vanguard Study was to test study
procedures and feasibilities, many changes were made over the course
of the 2-year study period. Specifically, changes to the data collection
protocols led to only a subset of mother-infant pairs with all study
variables collected. Of the 618 mother-infant pairs, 212 pairs without
2

missing data were included to evaluate the association between birth
outcome and DMA, and 114 pairs without missing data were included
in relation to total arsenic. For adverse health outcomes during preg-
nancy, 208 and 112 women without missing data were included to
investigate the association with DMA and total arsenic, respectively.

each analysis.
2.2. Assessment of prenatal arsenic exposure
A spot urine sample was collected during the third trimester from a
subset of participants. Urine was collected into a pre-screened metal-
free container and was frozen locally until shipment on dry ice to the
NCS Repository (Fisher Bioservices, Rockville, MD). Urine was ali-
quoted into pre-screened metal-free cryovials and stored at —80 oc
until shipment on dry ice to the US Centers for Disease Control's
National Center for Environmental Health. Since the initial purpose of
laboratory testing of the Initial Vanguard Study was operational quality
control assessment, urine samples were selected for measuring total
arsenic and arsenic species based on availability across study sites
(without any additional criteria). Further, experiments for total arsenic
and arsenic species were administered at different time points, resulting
in different sample sizes available for the analyses in the current study.
Urinary total arsenic concentration was measured by inductively-cou-
pled-plasma dynamic-reaction-cell mass spectrometry (ICP-DRC-MS),
with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.25 gg/L. Concentrations of urinary
arsenic species were measured using high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC) coupled to ICP-DRC-MS. The LODs were as follows:
arsenic acid (1 gg/L), arsenobetaine (0.4 gg/L), arsenocholine (0.6 gg/
L), arsenous acid (1.2 gg/L), DMA (1.7 gg/L), MMA (0.9 gg/L), and
trimethylarsine oxide (1 gg/L). For analytical results below the LOD, an
imputed value equivalent to the LOD divided by the square-root of two
was assigned. Here, total arsenic (0% < 1.25 gg/L) and DMA
(23.1% < 1.7 gg/L) were analyzed as main exposure variables since a
significant percentage of samples ( > 60%) had concentrations of other
metabolites (i.e., arsenic acid, arsenobetaine, arsenocholine, arsenous
acid, MMA, and trimethylarsine oxide) below the LOD.
2.3. Assessment of outcomes
The NCS protocol included physical examination of children at
birth. Birth length (cm) and head circumference (cm) were measured
twice, and the average of the two readings was used. For offspring
without measures of length (n 17) and head circumference (n 15),
values were abstracted from medical records using Community Health
Information Architecture (CHITA) instruments. Birth weight was not
measured during the physical exam and was therefore extracted from
medical records. Ponderal index, an indicator of infant adiposity, is a
measure of in utero growth retardation
(Vintzileos et al., 1986; Yagel
). Thus, we derived ponderal index by dividing birth weight
et al., 1987
in kilograms by cubed birth length in meters (kg/m3). Gestational age
was also collected from medical records, and preterm birth was defined
less than 37 completed weeks of gestational.
Information regarding complications during pregnancy was ab-
stracted from medical records at the final birth visit. Three dichotomous
(yes, no) outcome variables were included in our analyses: any com-
plication, gestational diabetes, and preeclampsia. Any complication
was defined as conditions including gestational diabetes, preeclampsia,
placenta previa, preterm birth, and significant vaginal bleeding (ex-
cluding previa).
2.4. Assessment of covariates
Maternal characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, education
level, family income, and number of previous live births, were obtained
from the first pregnancy interview. Self-reported weight and height
Environmental Research 183 (2020) 109182
before pregnancy were also recorded, and pre-pregnancy body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)/[height (m)]2. Infant sex was
ascertained from medical records. Concentrations of creatinine were
measured in spot urine samples collected during the third trimester
from all women using the Roche Hitachi Modular P Chemistry Analyzer
and Creatinine Plus Assay reagents by NCEH's laboratory.
2.5. Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Demographic variables, maternal character-
istics, and infant physical measures were summarized overall (212
mother-infant pairs without missing data on DMA, birth outcomes, or
covariates of interest) and by quartiles of prenatal DMA concentrations.
Differences between quartiles of exposure were assessed using chi-
square test for categorical variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) test
for normally distributed continuous variables (maternal age, pre-preg-
nancy BMI, gestational age, birth weight, birth length, head cir-
cumference, and ponderal index), and Kruskal-Wallis test for non-nor-
mally distributed continuous variables (urinary total arsenic and
creatinine).
The association between arsenic exposure and pregnancy compli-
cations was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, with odds
ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIS) reported. Analyses were ad-
justed for urinary creatinine (gg/L), maternal age (years), race/ethni-
city (Caucasian, African American, other races), maternal education
(< high school, high school graduate, > high school), family income
(s$29999, $30000-$74999, >$75000), and continuous pre-preg-
nancy BMI (kg/m2). For preterm birth, the analysis additionally con-
trolled for infant sex and parity number (O, 1, 22). Given the limited
sample size, only DMA was evaluated in the analyses of pregnancy
complications. DMA was modeled as an un-transformed continuous
variable. DMA was also modeled as quartiles of exposure only for the
association in relation to the pregnancy complication summary vari-
able.
For birth outcomes, we applied a multivariable linear regression
model adjusted for urinary creatinine, maternal age, race/ethnicity,
maternal education, family income, pre-pregnancy BMI, infant sex,
parity number, and gestational age (months) to obtain expected
changes and 95% CIS. Both total arsenic and DMA were modeled as
quartile categories as well as un-transformed continuous variables.
To test for linear trends by quartile of exposure, p-values were ob-
tained by treating quartiles of exposure as ordinal variables and re-
peating the above analyses. Previous studies suggested potential sex-
specific effects of arsenic exposure on birth outcomes (Cooperstock and
Campbell, 1996; Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016; Zeitlin et al., 2002);
thus, multivariable regression models with cross-product terms be-
tween prenatal arsenic exposure and infant sex were conducted to as-
sess modification by infant sex. For all analyses conducted, a p-value
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Four sensitivity analyses were conducted. The first was performed in
relation to birth outcomes (i.e., birthweight, birth length, head cir-
cumference, and ponderal index) restricted to 204 mother-infant pairs
(107 pairs for total arsenic) with gestation age 37 weeks (Wilcox
et al., 2011). The second sensitivity analysis was conducted using ge-
stational age and sex-standardized z-scores of birth outcomes (i.e., birth
weight, birth length, and head circumference) calculated based on
Fenton's growth chart (
Fenton and Kim, 2013
). The third sensitivity
analysis was implemented to evaluate potential residual confounding
effects from gestational diabetes and preeclampsia (as well as delivery
mode (vaginal, cesarean) for head circumference) on the associations
between arsenic exposure and birth outcomes. For the last sensitivity
analysis, we used a residual-based method (Jones et al., 2016) to re-
move the impact of seafood-derived organic arsenic on urinary total
arsenic and DMA by accounting for arsenobetaine. We obtained model
residuals by regressing log-transformed total arsenic and DMA on log-

total arsenic and DMA were then calculated by adding the means of
total arsenic and DMA among participants with low arsenobetaine
(< 1 gg/L) back to the residuals. The fully adjusted regression models
were rerun with estimated total arsenic and DMA exposures for both
birth outcomes and pregnancy complications.

shows the distribution of selected characteristics for 212
mother-infant pairs. Results by exposure quartile are not shown for
variables with < 10 participants in each quartile following the dis-
closure policies of the NCS. Most women included in our analyses were
Caucasian (n = 169, 79.7%). Mean maternal age was 28.6 years, and
mean pre-pregnancy BMI was 25.8 kg/m2. Median prenatal urinary
concentrations of total arsenic and DMA were 7.77 and 3.44 gg/L, re-
spectively. Pregnancy complications were reported in 80 (38.5%) of the
208 women in the study, including 18 (8.7%) with gestational diabetes
and 10 (4.8%) with preeclampsia. Mean ponderal index significantly
differed across quartiles of maternal urinary DMA, with the lowest
mean ponderal index observed among infants with the highest prenatal
DMA levels.

sum-
marizes results from the multivariable analysis. Prenatal urinary total
arsenic exposure was positively associated with infant birth length and
head circumference and negatively associated with ponderal index. A
one-interquartile range (IQR) increase in total arsenic was associated
with a 0.28-cm (95% CI: 0.14, 0.42) increase in birth length, a 0.12-cm
(95% CI: 0.04, 0.21) increase in head circumference, and a 0.37-kg/m3
(95% CI: —0.58, —0.17) decrease in ponderal index. When modeling
arsenic exposure as quartiles, infants in the highest quartile of total
arsenic had birth length and head circumference 2.21 cm (95% CI: 0.87,
3.55) and 0.97 cm (95% CI: 0.16, 1.77) greater than those in the lowest
quartile, respectively. Infants in the top quartile of total arsenic ex-
posure had a ponderal index that was 2.41 kg/m3 (95% CI
: —4.37,
—0.44) less than those in the lowest quartile. Linear dose-response
relationships between total arsenic exposure, birth length, head cir-
cumference, and ponderal index were supported by statistically sig-
nificant trend tests (ptrend < 0.05).
Similar findings were observed for prenatal DMA exposure. An IQR
increase in DMA was associated with a 0.40-cm (95% CI: 0.13, 0.66)
increase in birth length, a O. 18-cm (95% CI: 0.02, 0.33) increase in head
circumference, and a 0.63-kg/m3 (95% CI: — 1.02, —0.25) decrease in
ponderal index. When treating arsenic exposure as quartiles, infants in
the top quartile of DMA exposure had birth length that was 1.25 cm
(95% CI: 0.07, 2.42) longer than those in the lowest quartile, and in-
fants in the highest quartile of DMA had a ponderal index 1.99 kg/m3
—0.29) less than those in the lowest quartile.

No significant association in relation to prenatal urinary arsenic

These null results were consistently observed for both total arsenic and

presents results from analyses examining potential effect
modification by infant sex. Prenatal total arsenic exposure was nega-
tively associated with ponderal index among both male and female
infants, but the association was stronger in females (pinteraction = 0.08).
Prenatal urinary DMA exposure was negatively associated with gesta-
tional age among female infants (Pinteraction
0.02). Among female
infants, for every IQR increase in DMA concentration, gestational age
decreased by 0.44 week (95% CI: —0.84, —0.05); no statistically sig-
nificant association was observed among male infants.
Findings from the sensitivity analysis restricted to 204 mother-in-
fant pairs with gestational age 237 weeks were not appreciably dif-
ferent from the overall analyses presented (data not shown). As shown
Supplemental Table 3,
analyses using z-scores of birth outcomes
generated similar results as compared to the analyses using original
values. Results from the sensitivity analysis further adjusting arsenic
exposure and birth outcome models for gestational diabetes and pre-
eclampsia (as well as delivery mode for head circumference) were also
consistent (data not shown), suggesting no important confounding by
these variables. A sensitivity analysis using estimated total arsenic and
DMA exposures was also conducted to account for organic arsenic (i.e,
arsenobetaine) from seafood intake based on the method of Jones et al.
Supplemental Tables 4—6 show results for the associations of estimated
arsenic exposures with birth outcomes and pregnancy complications.
Table 3
Findings from these analyses were not appreciably different from the
original analyses (
Table 2 & Table 3
); however, an inverse association
between estimated total arsenic exposure and ponderal index was ob-
served to be stronger in male infants in the sensitivity analyses.
4. Discussion
We assessed the impact of prenatal arsenic exposure measured from
maternal urine at the third trimester on the risk of complications during
pregnancy as well as birth outcomes using a sample of mother-infant
pairs from the US-based NCS. Prenatal exposure to total arsenic as well
as DMA was positively associated with birth length and head cir-
cumference and negatively associated with ponderal index. Our results
from analyses evaluating effect modification by infant sex further found
a negative association between concentration of DMA and gestational
age only among female infants. Maternal urinary arsenic at the third
trimester was not significantly associated with birth weight or com-
plications during pregnancy. Given the rigorous study design, good
exposure metric (i.e., urinary arsenic biomarker), and critical exposure
time window selected, this study adds valuable information to current
evidence on the impact of low-level prenatal arsenic exposure on birth
outcomes.
A positive relationship between arsenic exposure and birth length
was previously observed in a large prospective cohort study conducted
in New Hampshire of 706 mother-infant pairs with similar levels of
arsenic exposure (Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016). That study reported a
0.22-cm and 0.21-cm increase in birth length in relation to each unit
increase in log-transformed prenatal DMA and total arsenic con-
centrations, respectively, measured from maternal urine at the second
trimester. Further, the study demonstrated that a positive association
between arsenic exposure and birth length was primarily driven by
male infants. Six other prospective studies evaluated this relationship;

no significant association was found in five of the studies conducted in
Bangladesh, Romania, Mexico, and Taiwan (Bloom et al., 2016; Chou
et al., 2014; Laine et al., 2015; Liao et al., 2018; A Rahman et al.,
), while a study in a Chinese population reported a negative as-
2009a
sociation between urinary arsenic exposure and birth length (Liu et al.,
). The potential for arsenic to enhance birth length (and subse-
2018
quently ponderal index) may be attributable to effects on bone devel-
opment. An in vitro study suggested that arsenic trioxide, an oxide of
arsenic, exerts different effects on osteoblast growth based on the given
dosage (
Xu et al., 2014)—while high dose of arsenic trioxide (5, 10, and
20 gM) induced apoptosis of osteoblasts, results demonstrated a sig-
nificantly enhanced viability of cultured osteoblasts as well as increased
collagen synthesis following exposure to a low dose (0.25, 0.5, and
1 gM) of arsenic trioxide. Therefore, the unexpected findings con-
necting higher (but still moderate) arsenic exposure to longer birth
length may be related to this or a similar phenomenon.
Our results linking higher arsenic exposure with greater head cir-
cumference at birth are in contrast to existing evidence suggesting a
negative association (Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016; Henn et al., 2016;
Liao et al., 2018; A Rahman et al., 2009a). Specifically, three pro-
spective cohort studies conducted in Bangladesh and the US observed
significant associations of maternal urinary total arsenic and blood ar-
senic levels with smaller head circumference (Gilbert-Diamond et al.,
2016; Henn et al., 2016; A Rahman et al., 2009a
). However, multiple
other studies have reported null associations (Bermudez et al., 2015;
Bloom et al., 2016; Chou et al., 2014; Laine et al., 2015
). Given the
inconsistencies with previous research and no apparent biological me-
chanism, the observed positive association between arsenic exposure
and head circumference in the current analysis might be spurious.
Taken together, these conflicting findings suggest that further research
is needed with a larger sample size and comprehensive measurement of
potential confounders.
Our observed association with ponderal index represents only the
third study to examine this measure of possible intrauterine growth
restriction. The previous research has been mixed, with one study also
reporting that lower ponderal index is associated with maternal urinary
arsenic levels (Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016) and the other finding null
results overall, but a significant positive association among female in-
fants (Bloom et al., 2016). Future research investigating the effect of
arsenic on ponderal index and the potential interaction effect with sex
is still needed.
Gestational age has been assessed as an outcome in multiple pre-
vious studies of arsenic exposure. Generally, these past studies reported
a significant relationship between decreased gestational age and arsenic
exposure measured in drinking water, maternal urine, and maternal
blood (
Henn et al., 2016; Laine et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2011
). Specifi-
cally, a study conducted in China observed a negative association in
male but not female infants
(Xu et al., 2011
). In contrast, we observed a
negative association between arsenic exposure and gestational age only
in female infants. Differences in the exposure concentrations, dietary or
behavioral practices, or ancestry of the study samples may account for
the differences observed between these studies. Although the evidence
connecting arsenic exposure to decreased gestational age is compelling,
further confirmation by additional studies is needed to evaluate whe-
ther effect modification of this association by infant sex is more widely
seen.
While gestational age and birth weight are biologically related, we
observed no significant association between prenatal arsenic exposure
and birth weight in the current study. A systematic review published in
2017 indicated that there is a convincing evidence on the association
between higher levels of arsenic exposure ( > 50 ppb) and decreased
birth weight. Further, in a recent meta-analysis using data from 12
studies, prenatal arsenic exposure was significantly associated with
decreased birth weight, and this observed negative association persisted
after restricting to 4 studies in populations with lower levels of arsenic
exposure (three US and one Chile) (
Zhong et al., 2019
). However, in a
Environmental Research 183 (2020) 109182
US prospective cohort study that is not included in the aforementioned
meta-analysis, no significant association was observed in relation to
birth weight (Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016). Although it is possible that
we had insufficient statistical power with the given sample to observe
an association between low-level arsenic exposure and birth weight,
further research in populations with lower levels of arsenic exposure is
still needed to evaluate this association.
Previous literature on the association between arsenic exposure and
pregnancy complications is relatively limited and reports mixed find-
ings, possibly due to the heterogeneity of study designs and exposure
metrics used across studies. While several studies have reported sig-
nificant associations between arsenic exposure and preterm birth
Ahmad et al., 2001; Almberg et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018; Rahman
et al., 2018
), others have observed no association (
Kim et al., 2018;
Myers et al., 2010). No significant association with gestational diabetes
has been observed for drinking water arsenic and prenatal urinary ar-
senic concentrations (Bloom et al., 2016; Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016)
Yet, studies that relied on maternal blood (Ettinger et al., 2009; Shapiro
et al., 2015), maternal serum (Xia et al., 2018), maternal toenail
(Farzan et al., 2016), and drinking water (Farzan et al., 2016; Marie
et al., 2018
) samples have shown significant associations of arsenic
exposure with increased risk of gestational diabetes or impaired glucose
tolerance; no association was found in relation to maternal urinary
arsenic (Farzan et al., 2016). Two case-control studies evaluated the
relationship between arsenic exposure and risk of preeclampsia, re-
porting no significant association (Elongi Moyene et al., 2016;
Sandoval-Carrillo et al., 2016). Our findings, which used internal bio-
markers of exposure, are consistent with these previous findings, sug-
gesting no association between urinary arsenic and pregnancy compli-
cations of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Still, the mixed
evidence underscores a need for further prospective studies assessing a
larger number of events.
In this study, two exposure variables (i.e., total arsenic and DMA)
were used to represent levels of arsenic exposure. Total arsenic is a
mixture of organic and inorganic arsenic, while DMA is one of the or-
ganic metabolites after the methylation of inorganic arsenic. Although
absolute value of DMA was used for the current analyses, DMA con-
centration may still imply two circumstances: (1) higher arsenic me-
tabolism efficiency; or (2) higher inorganic arsenic exposure. This may
explain the different findings in relation to total arsenic and DMA in our
sex-stratified analyses. In a study reporting results for the associations
of both total arsenic and DMA with birth outcomes, findings were si-
milar between total arsenic and DMA (Gilbert-Diamond et al., 2016)
They also supported our findings of positive associations between DMA
and birth length as well as negative associations in relation to ponderal
index. Further, no significant association was found in relation to ar-
senic methylation efficiency indices (i.e., MMA/inorganic arsenic and
DMA/MMA) with birth outcomes in the aforementioned study.
The conclusions of this study could be strengthened by future re-
search. First, the exposure assessment, while an accurate biomarker of
arsenic exposure, captures exposure during the third trimester only. The
third-trimester urine sample may reflect exposure after the time that is
most critical for developing pregnancy complications, and potential
misclassification of prenatal arsenic exposure may exist due to the re-
latively short half-life of arsenic in urine. Furthermore, the laboratory
method used for measuring arsenobetaine in this study had a higher
LOD (0.4 gg/L) as compared to some previous studies (Gilbert-Diamond
et al., 2016; Laine et al., 2015
), and 67% of samples (n = 143) had
arsenobetaine concentrations below the LOD. Therefore, the estimated
non-seafood arsenic exposures used in the sensitivity analyses may not
be accurate. We further compared the percentage below the LOD and
level of arsenobetaine between women in the 2003—2010 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles and the
Supplemental Table 7). Within the NHANES sample, pregnant
NCS (
women had lower mean arsenobetaine concentrations compared to
non-pregnant women of child-bearing age (20—44 years of age). Among

Abstract
We estimate that prenatal care has positive impacts on health measured at
birth, shifts the distribution of future health care utilization away from
inpatient care, and find that some of these impacts likely come from an
informational mechanism. We also find well child visits are used in a com-
plementary fashion with emergency department care in the production of
infant health, suggesting that factors beyond barriers to access may drive the
demand for emergency care. Finally, we find differential impacts of prenatal
care across racial groups with evidence that the information mechanism may
be particularly important for black mothers.

BACKGROUND
Poor health at birth generates substantial medical costs and is associated with subsequent health problems that extend
well into the future. For instance, infants born at low birth weight are statistically more likely to have lower educational
attainment, lower wages, and worse employment prospects compared to normal weight peers (Almond et al., 2005;
Behrman & Rosenzweig, 2004; Black et al., 2007). Given the importance of early health, it is important to understand
the underlying mechanisms and factors that impact birth outcomes. Prenatal care, as perhaps the earliest medical input
into child health, deserves special attention. Medical professionals emphasize the importance of prenatal care to both
monitor maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and to minimize potential risk factors. Despite the common
perception that increased prenatal care should lead to more favorable health outcomes, the current economic literature
provides confounding evidence as to the marginal impacts of prenatal care on infant health at birth, and scant evidence
of any kind regarding the direct long run impacts of prenatal care on future well-being.
One major difficulty in identifying the causal effects of prenatal care arises from the decision to seek prenatal care itself.
Unobservable maternal health characteristics and attitudes may simultaneously influence choices to seek prenatal care
and also have a direct effect on infant health, making it difficult to isolate causal relationships. While a majority of early

studies relied on ordinary least squares multivariate regressions, more recent work has made efforts to account for the
potential endogeneity of prenatal care. Evans and Lien (2005) exploit a disruption in public transportation due to a bus
strike in Pennsylvania as an instrument for prenatal care. Despite statistically imprecise estimates, they find that prenatal
visits missed in early pregnancy negatively impact birth weight, while those missed later in pregnancy do not have affect
birth weight. Currie and Grogger (2002) use expansions of the Medicaid program as an instrument and find prenatal care
reduces the incidence of very low birth weight among white mothers. Sonchak (2015) uses Medicaid reimbursement rates
as an instrument and estimates that additional visits increase birth weight among white mothers but have no effect for
black mothers. Broadly, this strand of literature can be grouped into studies finding positive effects of prenatal care
(Conway & Deb, 2005; Liu, 1998; Liu et al., 2009; Rosenzweig & Schultz, 1983; Yan, 2020), those finding no effects
(Jones, 1991; Li & Poirier, 2003), and those finding only weak effects (Currie & Grogger, 2002; Evans & Lien, 2005). Corman
et al. (2019) also provide an excellent and more extensive review of the existing literature.
To our knowledge, and due to the difficulty of linking mothers across births, only a few studies have utilized panel
data and maternal fixed effects to estimate the impacts of prenatal care. Abrevaya and Dahl (2008) use data from
Washington and Arizona between 1992 and 2002 to study the effect of different inputs, including smoking and prenatal
care, on child health using quantile estimation. Their results indicate a larger positive effect of prenatal care at the
bottom of the birth weight distribution. Royer (2004) focuses on the effect of maternal age on prematurity and incidence
of low birth weight by using a panel of mothers from Texas. More recently, Balsa and Triunfo (2015) examine the
impact of prenatal care on infant birth weight among low-income women in Uruguay and find prenatal care decreases
the likelihood of low birth weight and preterm birth. Yan (2017) examines whether prenatal care has an effect on
maternal behaviors and maternal health, including postpartum smoking, premature rupture of membranes, precipitous
labor, breastfeeding, and other outcomes, and finds that early onset of prenatal care confers positive effects on maternal
health and behaviors. Yan (2020) uses data from Pennsylvania and a similar study design to ours and finds that early
onset of prenatal care broadly improves an infant's stock of health capital. None of these studies, however, utilize any
child health outcomes beyond those observable at the time of birth.
In contrast to its impacts on infant health at birth, there is very limited literature on any intermediate or longer run
impacts of prenatal care directly. Freed et al. (1999) and Kogan et al. (1998) both find a positive association between
adequate and early initiation of prenatal care respectively on subsequent well child visits (WCVs), though neither study
accounts for the potential endogeneity of the decision to seek care. In the economics literature, Reichman et al. (2010)
offer a theoretical framework that is quite similar to ours and estimate that prenatal care is associated with positive
changes in maternal postpartum behaviors and subsequent well child health care, while Noonan et al. (2()13) investigate
the effects of prenatal care and find no impacts on four outcomes for children at age 5: health status, height, weight, and
asthma diagnosis. Both studies use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study. Despite accounting for a
rich set of covariates, as well as controlling for state, city and hospital indicators and performing a variety of robustness
checks, these studies do not explicitly account for the potential endogeneity of prenatal care.
Our study uses unique maternally linked birth data from Vital Statistics Natality files for the state of South Carolina
from 2004 to 2013 to reexamine the effect of prenatal care on the health of newborns. We extend on the prior literature
by estimating the longer term effects of prenatal care on future health care utilization patterns identified from linked
South Carolina Medicaid claims files. We estimate plausibly causal impacts of prenatal care by including maternal fixed
effects which control for all time-invariant unobserved characteristics of the mother. Understanding the causal effect of
prenatal care on child health and health care utilization is of paramount importance, and the results we obtain are
likely to have important policy implications regarding the long term cost-effectiveness of prenatal care.

2.1
THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK
Outline of theoretical model
The theoretical framework underlying our study mirrors the health production function in a dynamic setting outlined
by Liu et al. (2009). In their framework, it is assumed parents maximize a time-separable concave utility function, with
per period utility given by U(ct, ht) where ct represents consumption during period t and ht represents child health at
the start of the period. Health cannot be altered within a time period nor can it be directly purchased, but parents can
impact the future health of their children through health inputs, ft. Again, following the notation in Liu, Mroz, and
Adair, we assume health status in the next period is given by

(1)
with the deterministic health production function and st+l a health shock distributed with mean of 1. In this
framework, the information set Qt captures parental information about the future distributions of prices, income, and
health shocks as of time t and the expected health stock in time period t + 1 is equal to Additionally, assume
that the following all hold:
< 0, and
Dht> 0 Dft
Dht2
DhtDhf
Liu, Mroz, and Adair show that the solution to the dynamic optimization problem where parents maximize the
present-discounted value of expected utility subject to a resource constraint, given by yt ct + p/ t with yt representing
parental resources, pt representing the price of health inputs, and the price of consumption normalized to 1, implies the
demand for health inputs at time t is a function of the form
ft Dft(yt, ht,pt, ot).
(2)
Equation (2) shows that the demand for health inputs only depends on the state variables observed at time t. They go
on to explain that under certain conditions, including the assumption that the distributions of health shocks, st, are
independent over time, it is not necessary to further condition the demand for inputs based on the information set.
However, some features of preventive care may compress or eliminate some outcomes from the distribution of
shocks, in which case it is not appropriate to assume this distribution is independent over time. Although some of these
impacts are captured by improved health on average, preventive care may also change the variance of outcomes.
Schoder and Zweifel (2()11) posit that this feature may be an important determinant of health care demand in some
cases. For example, if st is distributed uniformly on the interval [0, 2], parents are willing to pay for preventive care that
changes the distribution of st to be distributed uniformly on the interval [0.9, 1.1]. In this case, the information set must
contain beliefs about how health inputs change the entire distribution of future health care shocks, I and not just beliefs
about the marginal productivity of care.
In our setting, it is likely that most direct effects of prenatal care on health are primarily through reducing the
variance of outcomes by monitoring for severe complications. Additionally, a fraction of the estimated impacts of
prenatal care seem likely to arise from indirect effects, whereby prenatal care influences the maternal information
making mothers more likely to cease smoking, eat nutritious food, or otherwise modify behaviors that directly influence
infant birth weight. In one of the few studies that we are aware of which separately estimates the impacts of the content
of prenatal care, Kogan et al. (1994) find that women who do not receive all types of recommended advice during their
prenatal care visits are significantly more likely to have an infant born at low birthweight than those that receive the
advice and also find no association between any clinical aspects of prenatal care and low birthweight. Additionally,
Yan (2020) provides evidence that maternal weight gain and smoking during pregnancy—behaviors that are influenced
by the provision of information during prenatal care appointments—are two distinct mechanisms through which
prenatal care influences infant health, while Yan (2017) also shows that these behaviors are influenced by prenatal care.
On the other hand, Dave et al. (2019) do not find evidence that increased contact with providers following Medicaid
expansions leads to modifications in maternal behavior during pregnancy, though they do find evidence that access to
insurance causes some behavioral changes through moral hazard. Though not related to prenatal care, Dave and
Kaestner (2009) find evidence that increased contact with physicians can lead to significant behavioral changes in
Medicare eligible individuals. In our case, the total estimated impacts of prenatal care on future health care utilization
will also be influenced if prenatal care changes parental beliefs about the value of future health care, and we refer to this
possibility as the information effect of prenatal care.
Implications of theoretical model for interpretations related to future health care

utilization
In an ideal world, we would estimate the net effects of prenatal care on future health outcomes. In our data, however,
we only observe future health care utilization, meaning our estimated impacts of prenatal care combine changes in

demand for future care arising from better health with changes in demand arising from changes to the maternal in-
formation set. Given that providing information and education is a large component of most prenatal care, it is highly
plausible that prenatal care influences the information set by providing parents with information about postnatal health
behaviors including interacting with the health care delivery system.
The estimated impacts of prenatal care on future health care utilization are given by estimating I with ft rep-
resenting prenatal care. Assuming prenatal care does not influence parental income or prices within the year imme-
diately following birth, our observed net effects of prenatal care on future health care utilization are driven by two
distinct pieces:
Dft+l
Dft
DDI 1 DDft+1
Dht+l Dft Dft
(3)
The first term on the right hand side of Equation (3) is the change in demand caused by any impacts of
prenatal care on health status. Our model assumes this term is weakly negative as, all else equal, those in better
health will consume less care. Additionally, the broad range of empirical findings outlined previously suggest this
term is, in fact, non-positive. The sign of the second term on the right hand side of Equation (3) is theoretically
ambiguous as increased information is likely to increase the demand for some types of health care while reducing
it for others. In cases where the net estimated impact of prenatal care on future care utilization is positive,
however,
> 0 must hold and the impact on care utilization arising from this change in information must be
large enough to outweigh reduced utilization from better health. Note that this does not imply that individuals who
consume less care are necessarily in better health, as the information effect can reduce the demand for certain
types of care. Rather, it implies that if prenatal care is associated with both better health and increased con-
sumption of a given type of future care it must be the case that the information effect increased the demand for
that type of care.
In the context of our theoretical model, we expect the information effect associated with prenatal care to increase
the demand for preventive types of care, such as WCVs, and to have little impact on inpatient (IP) care which is
typically only accessed through a physician gatekeeper. The predicted sign of the information effect for care in an
emergency department (ED) is theoretically ambiguous. If preventive care is a substitute for ED usage, increased in-
formation should decrease the demand for care in an ED. In a current NBER working paper, Danagoulian et al. (2020)
document that increased primary care visits following an information shock from the Flint water crisis led to a sig-
nificant reduction in subsequent avoidable childhood ED visits. If, however, preventive care and ED care are used as
complements in the production of health and the prevention of disease, it is possible that the information effect would
increase the demand for emergency care. Maeng et al. (2017) document that primary care visits appear to be com-
plementary to multiple ED visits, while Chen et al. (2019) find that increased usage of primary care following increases
in Medicaid reimbursement rates does not decrease ED usage, suggesting that primary care and ED care may not be
substitutes on the margin. In our setting, if a portion of prenatal care appointments are used to communicate common
signs of infant distress that require timely care, prenatal care may make mothers more likely to recognize when an
appropriate threshold for seeking care has been crossed. This information would induce a mother to seek care in either
an outpatient, urgent care, or emergency setting for her child depending on what is available at the moment the
threshold is breached. Our results suggest this is the case and that the information effect dominates the health effect for
both well child and ED care.

DATA
Vital statistics data
Although United States federal law requires the collection and publication of Vital Statistics data, Federal Vital Statistics
do not contain personal identifiers. However, some individual states will release personally identifiable information for
specific research purposes. In this study, we use Natality Data from the State of South Carolina for the time period of
2004—2013. The data are collected from birth certificates and include nearly all births occurring in South Carolina

during the time period under investigation. Researchers from the Division of Biostatistics of the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control linked mothers across time and provided de-identified data for this
project. These data include detailed information on infant health at birth including birth weight, gestational age, the
presence of birth abnormalities, and whether the child was admitted into the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). They
also contain basic demographic information pertaining to mother and child (maternal education, age, race, child's
gender), detailed measures of maternal pre-pregnancy and pregnancy risk factors, and information on prenatal care
utilization. We use these data to construct our main measures of infant health and provide summary statistics in
Table 1.
The Natality data provide information on the number of prenatal care visits, the month of pregnancy during which
prenatal care was initiated, and the adequacy of prenatal care. All of these measures have variously been employed in
different studies throughout the literature. We focus on first trimester initiation of prenatal care which is indicative of
prenatal care timing, and an early commencement of prenatal care is urged by doctors. Additionally, as pointed out by
Currie and Rossin-Slater (2015), the number of prenatal care visits may not be an appropriate measure as the number of
visits are at least partially determined by the length of gestation which is an important determinant of birth weight
itself. While our primary specifications compare first trimester initiation of care to an aggregated measure of any other
initiation, our first trimester results are robust to separately controlling for second and third trimester initiation relative
to no prenatal care.
Because early initiation of prenatal care may not fully capture the amount of prenatal care received by mothers, we
employ an alternative measure as a robustness check: the adequacy of prenatal care as measured by the Kotelchuck
index. This index is constructed by calculating a ratio of observed to expected prenatal care visits, adjusted for gesta-
tional age, classified into four categories: inadequate, intermediate, adequate, and adequate plus (Kotelchuck, 1994). We
compress this categorical variable into a binary indicator for whether a mother received at least adequate prenatal care.
Finally, in online Appendix E, we re-estimate our models with indicators for first trimester initiation, third trimester
initiation, and no prenatal care to allow for a finer gradation of the impacts of prenatal care than those of our binary
measures as presented in the main text.
For outcomes, we employ a continuous measure of birth weight as well as the incidence of low birth weight
(<2500 g) and very low birth weight (<1500 g). Medical and economic research has generally found convincing
evidence of the detrimental effects of low birth weight on infant survival and future health. An additional indicator
for infant health is gestational age at birth. Infants that are born prematurely (less than 37 weeks of gestation) have a
much higher incidence of mortality. According to Mathews et al. (2015), health issues related to prematurity were
responsible for 36% of all infant deaths in 2013. Additionally, premature infants may suffer long-term neurological
impairments, developmental delays and physical disabilities leading to significant health care costs throughout life.
Although gestational age can directly influence the number of visits, it cannot influence the onset of prenatal care.
Therefore, we also estimate the effect of prenatal care on the likelihood of being born prematurely as well as on the
likelihood of being small for gestational age (SGA) and being admitted into a NICU. Finally, we estimate the impacts
of prenatal care on the incidence of high birth weight (>4000 g), maternal smoking during pregnancy, and maternal
weight gain, as these outcomes are likely to reflect the pure informational impacts of prenatal care as measured at
birth.
3.2 Medicaid claims data
The South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs office provided data from South Carolina Medicaid claims of children
between 2004 and 2014. These claims are submitted to the state for reimbursement and provide a rich source of in-
formation on health care utilization for Medicaid enrollees. Specifically, each claim provides information on medical
procedures that took place during health care encounters, medical diagnoses, indicators for whether the claim origi-
nated in an ED or IP setting, and includes a unique patient identifier. Additionally, each claim has an associated
encounter identifier which allows us to identify whether multiple claims are associated with the same event; while we
use this encounter ID to generate all count variables, we continue to refer to the encounters as "claims" for ease of
exposition. We use procedure codes 99381, 99391, 99382, and 99392 to identify WCVs,2 and ICD-9 diagnoses to identify
children who have ever received care for several ambulatory care sensitive early childhood conditions (ACSCs) which
are referenced in online Appendix A. We provide sample means for all outcomes of interest in results Tables 3, 4, and
A1. Although South Carolina does cover some children through the Children's Health Insurance Program, which

operated as a separate program through 2010 until it was converted to a Medicaid Expansion program only, our data
exclude these children and only include claims from infants covered under the Pregnant Women and Infants provision
of Medicaid which provides coverage through the first year of an infant's life for families making less than 185% of the
federal poverty level.
We construct all health and health care utilization measures by aggregating observed claims for each child within
the first year of life. We choose to focus on the first year of life because we only observe claims for children that are
covered by Medicaid. The vast majority (over 97%) of Medicaid-paid births in our sample are observed to have
continuous Medicaid coverage in the year they are born, limiting concerns about endogenous movements in and out of
Medicaid eligibility. For health care utilization, we create count variables for the number of claims each child has in an
IP setting or originating in an ED for all claims as well as all WC Vs.
Sample construction
3.3
Because our identification strategy relies on mothers with multiple observed births, we start with a sample of 180,453
singleton multiparous births between 2004 and 2013 that are observed to have any Medicaid eligibility before 2015.
From this, we exclude 3627 observations with no observed claims during the first year of life, 369 births to mothers
aged younger than 15 or older than 45, and 1451 observations because of missing data. Because this process leaves
some observations without sibling pairs, we eliminate a further 3299 observations leaving us with a final unit of
analysis of 171,665 multiparous children. Of these births, 77,725 are from 31,860 distinct mothers that change their
prenatal care utilization across pregnancies. While our estimated impacts of prenatal care are only identified by those
mothers who change their utilization of prenatal care across pregnancies, we provide summary statistics for all
331,882 observed births with Medicaid eligibility and no missing data for comparison. We choose to exclude children
with 0 observed claims because any child moving out of state or obtaining access to an alternate source of care or
insurance would not show up in our claims data. Given that this group represents only about 2% of our sample, we
believe it is likely that the majority of these infants are obtaining care outside of the South Carolina Medicaid system
rather than truly forgoing all care (including well child care). Finally, it should be noted that the children included
in our analysis represent approximately 30.5% of the 562,026 total births observed in South Carolina between 2004 and
2013.

CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
We assume outcomes for child i born to mother j at time period t in county c and in month m can be represented by:
-4- Xijtcmß2 4- + yt + Ac + V m + Cijtcm•
ijtcm
(4)
Yijtcm is a child outcome, such as birth weight in grams or number of WCVs; PCijtcm represents a measure of prenatal
care; Xijtcm is a vector of observed maternal and child characteristics including mother's age, race, education, reported
household income, pre-pregnancy BMI, length of gestation in weeks, indicator variables for whether a mother was
smoking before pregnancy, pre-pregancy diabetes and hypertension, previous poor birth outcomes or preterm birth,
previous c-section, child gender, first born status, indicators for ages of older siblings at the time of birth, and prenatal
WIC participation. We also include separate indicators yt, Ac, and l,'m for year, month, and county of birth respectively.
Finally, gj represents unobserved time invariant characteristics of the mother, such as health attitudes or endowments,
6
while Eijtcm represents unobserved time variant factors that influence health outcomes.
As previously discussed, one difficulty associated with obtaining causal estimates of prenatal care's impacts on
future outcomes is that unobserved maternal characteristics may simultaneously influence these outcomes and how a
pregnant mother utilizes prenatal care. If this is the case, unobserved maternal characteristics, gj, will be correlated
with the measure of prenatal care, PC . For instance, health-conscious mothers may initiate early and frequent
ijtcm
doctors visits and be more likely to give birth to healthy babies independently of prenatal care. This will result in
positive selection and OLS estimates of Equation (4) will overstate the benefits of prenatal care. On the other hand,
unhealthy mothers may compensate for their own poor health by utilizing more prenatal care. In this case, the OLS
estimated impact of prenatal care on birth outcomes will be biased downward.
To circumvent bias stemming from the inability to control explicitly for maternal health endowments or attitudes,
we employ mother-specific fixed effects. The availability of panel data allows us to compare birth outcomes to the same
mother and control explicitly for gj, meaning the key identifying assumption is that the decision to utilize prenatal care
is only uncorrelated with time variant unobserved maternal characteristics, Cijtcm. We will obtain consistent estimates as
long as there are not unobserved time variant factors that influence both outcomes and prenatal care utilization, and by
explicitly controlling for gj our estimated impacts of prenatal care are obtained from differences in outcomes for
mothers who change their prenatal care behavior across pregnancies.
We attempt to mitigate any concerns about our identification strategy in a number of ways. To control for the
possibility of feedback across pregnancies, our preferred specifications include a rich set of controls related to outcomes
of prior pregnancies and add a full set of year, month, and county of birth fixed effects to control for geographic or
temporal factors that may influence access to care. We mitigate concerns that changes in family income, insurance
status, or access to care could potentially drive changes in prenatal care utilization and future outcomes by limiting our
analyses to only those infants who are eligible for Medicaid within their first year of life, and all reported results are
robust to controlling for the observed payer at delivery, and further control for reported family income to address
concerns that changes to the Medicaid income eligibility threshold for infants during our study period are driving our
results. Finally, we present all fixed effects estimates with both the complete exclusion of controls and with a limited
subset of demographic controls to illustrate the stability of the estimates and the degree to which prenatal care is
correlated with observed time variant factors. Our estimates are quite stable to the inclusion of these controls, sug-
gesting that prenatal care is not highly correlated with observed factors that also influence outcomes and diminishing
the concern that it is likely correlated with unobserved factors.
We test for reverse causality using observed pre-pregnancy maternal health factors as outcomes, as correlations
may indicate other unobserved components of maternal health that are related to both the decision to seek pre-
natal care and to future health outcomes. Even with these robustness checks, our identification strategy may still
be biased if there are unobserved factors that are specific to a given pregnancy, such as low maternal weight gain
or vaginal bleeding during the first trimester, that influence the decision to seek care and outcomes for that
pregnancy. Although we cannot directly rule this possibility out, factors such as these seem most likely to reveal
the potential for poor health status and would therefore bias our results downwards, causing us to underestimate
any benefits of prenatal care. Concerns that the decision to seek prenatal care is directly related to variations in
household income or insurance status are mitigated by the fact that all of our estimated impacts on future uti-
lization are obtained within the sample of Medicaid eligible children. While there may be some concern due to the


56 | CONTEMPORARY ECONOMIC POLICY
BERSAK AND SONCHAK-ARDAN
fact that our data span both the Great Recession and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, these events
would only pose identification problems if they changed the composition of Medicaid eligible births or directly
influence prenatal care utilization and future outcomes. However, South Carolina was one of the states which did
not expand Medicaid following the passage of the Affordable Care Act and we only observe slight (no more than
6% from baseline) increases in the number of Medicaid eligible births during the Great Recession. Additionally, we
observe between 47% and 54% of mothers with first trimester initiation of prenatal care for each of the 10 years in
our data suggesting that if any changes in utilization patterns are driven by the Great Recession they are small in
nature.
A final concern is that the subgroup of mothers who change their prenatal care utilization across pregnancies are
fundamentally different from mothers with consistent prenatal care. In Table 1, we present summary statistics for three
distinct groups of mothers: all mothers in column 1, multiparous mothers in column 2, and mothers with differences in
first trimester initiation of care across different births in column 3. Although the subgroup of mothers in column 3 look
somewhat similar to the full sample of multiparous mothers along many dimensions, most differences between the
groups are statistically significant due to the large sample sizes. It is important to remember that inclusion in this group
is conditional upon having at least one pregnancy in both groups of prenatal care, and it is therefore logical and to be
expected that the averages for the prenatal care variables, as well as all potential outcome variables would be signifi-
cantly different from the full sample averages.
Equation (4) assumes the impacts of prenatal care are constant and symmetric across the birth order and irre-
spective of the direction of change, meaning we will not identify any impacts of prenatal care that arise through
mechanisms which durably impact future outcomes. For instance, if an educational component of prenatal care
provides durable human capital, then any mothers with adequate prenatal care in an early pregnancy would continue
to see impacts in future pregnancies regardless of future prenatal care utilization. Broadly speaking, we find no
consistent differential impacts of prenatal care for first born children when we relax these assumptions, and we report
results from this set of estimates and provide a brief discussion of the theoretical implications in online Appendix C.
Our approach also implicitly assumes that prenatal care from an early pregnancy does not influence observed
maternal pre-pregnancy risk factors, such as smoking status or BMI before becoming pregnant. To the extent that
these assumptions are invalid, they will bias us against finding any impacts of prenatal care and our estimates that
control for observed pre-pregnancy risk factors can be interpreted as the impacts of prenatal care net of any impacts
arising through these channels.
In spite of these robustness checks, our results still rest on the key assumption of this identification strategy: that
changes in prenatal care utilization across pregnancies are not related to unobserved changes in maternal charac-
teristics. There are a number of exogenous factors that could cause changes to prenatal care utilization stemming from
the supply side of the health care delivery system. Low-income Medicaid women may have difficulties finding a
physician willing to accept them, scheduling health care appointments, or having to wait for long periods in clinics
(Beckmann et al., 2000; Sunil et al., 2010). Some studies identified changes in Medicaid reimbursement rates to
physicians for treating Medicaid patients as a determinant of the amount of prenatal care received by women
(Gray, 2001; Sonchak, 2015). Other studies have exploited factors that influence access to care such as a lack of
transportation, transportation disruptions, or distance to clinics. Evans and Lien (2005) estimate that a transportation
strike in Pennsylvania contributed to missed prenatal care visits, while in related work Rossin-Slater (2013) finds
geographic access to a clinic impacts a mother's likelihood of participation in the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)
program.
Unfortunately, because our data only come from South Carolina and do not include particularly fine measures of
patient or provider location, we are not able to empirically identify specific external factors that cause changes in
prenatal care over time in our setting. However, as mentioned above, we control for a rich set of time variant personal
maternal characteristics, as well as provide a battery of robustness checks that adds credence to our findings. Addi-
tionally, this identification strategy has been recently used by Yan (2020) to estimate the impacts of prenatal care on
outcomes at birth, and by Bersak and Sonchak (2018), and Chorniy et al. (2020) to provide plausibly causal estimates of
the impact of receiving WIC on childhood health and health care outcomes. To the extent that the reasons behind
changes in prenatal care are exogenous to changes in factors we are unable to control for, these results will provide
causal estimates on the effect of prenatal care on infant health and health care utilization. Additionally, it should be
noted our that findings that primary care visits and ED visits are used in a complementary fashion in the production of
7
infant health do not rely on the validity of this identification strategy.

RESULTS
Validity of fixed effects strategy
Table 2 contains our estimated impacts of prenatal care on pre-pregnancy smoking, body mass index (BMI), hyper-
tension, diabetes, and, for second or later births, prior poor pregnancy outcomes. Because each of these "outcomes"
occur prior to pregnancy, they cannot be influenced by prenatal care and therefore observed correlations are indicative
of self-selection into prenatal care. The OLS estimates contained in column 1 suggest there is on net some negative
selection into prenatal care, as early initiation of care is associated with a higher probability of pre-pregnancy smoking,
obesity, hypertension, and prior poor pregnancy outcomes. Within mothers, however, we find more limited evidence of
selection into prenatal care across pregnancies, with the exception of prior poor birth outcomes. In column 2, we report
fixed effects estimates that exclude all other controls, and estimate that only pre-pregnancy hypertension and prior poor
birth outcomes are associated with early initiation of prenatal care. In column 3, with the inclusion of demographic
controls, we see a small and marginally significant relationship between prenatal care initiation and pre-pregnancy
tobacco usage and a positive and statistically significant relationship between prenatal care and prior poor out-
comes. Finally, in column 4 we estimate that receiving adequate prenatal care is associated with a statistically sig-
nificant 0.68 percentage point decrease in the probability of maternal smoking prior to pregnancy. While this result is
statistically different from 0, it represents a decrease of less than 3.3% from the baseline probability of smoking before
pregnancy and is therefore a relatively small change. Taken on the whole, the estimates in Table 2 suggest that, after the
inclusion of maternal fixed effects, prenatal care is at worst weakly related to observed maternal risk factors, while the

OLS results are indicative of negative selection bias with some mothers compensating for other risky behaviors by
initiating prenatal care earlier. There is some stronger evidence that some prenatal care may be related to prior
pregnancy outcomes, where some mothers may self-sort into early initiation of prenatal care, which is more concerning
for our identification strategy. However, the low baseline frequency of prior poor outcomes means that a relatively small
number of mothers are in this group and are therefore unlikely to drive our other results. As a robustness check to
ensure that selection following prior poor outcomes does not drive our results, in online Appendix D we exclude all
births occurring to mothers with prior poor outcomes and obtain qualitatively similar results.
Impacts of prenatal care on outcomes at birth
5.2
Table 3 shows the impacts of prenatal care on outcomes measured at birth. We present OLS results in column 1 for
comparison, fixed effects estimates with the complete exclusion of controls in column 2, and fixed effects estimates with
the inclusion of only demographic controls in column 3.8 The point estimated impacts of prenatal care are remarkably
stable across all fixed effects specifications, although they are somewhat more precise with the inclusion of controls.
Using our preferred specifications in column 4, which contain fixed effects and all controls, first trimester initiation of
prenatal care is associated with an increased birth weight of 33.6 g, as well as a decrease in the probability of being born
below the low birth weight and very low birth weight thresholds of 2500 and 1500 g by 1.13 and 0.49 percentage points
respectively. Because these are relatively rare outcomes, this represents a 12.0% decrease in the incidence of infants
born at low birth weight and a 32.6% decrease in the incidence of infants born at very low birth weight.
First trimester initiation of prenatal care is also associated with between a 0.69 and 1.03 percentage point reduction
in the probability of being SGA, or being admitted to the NICU at birth, which represent between a 5.8% and 13.8%
reduction in the baseline incidence. Although all point estimates obtained from fixed effects specifications are smaller
than those obtained via OLS, they are all statistically significant at a 1% confidence level. While we estimate that early
initiation of prenatal care is associated with a reduction in the probability of preterm birth, in columns 3 and 4 when we
include controls the relationship is small and statistically insignificant. In column 5, we report estimates using the
Kotelchuck index as an alternative measure for prenatal care; for the most part these results are similar to those ob-
tained when using first trimester initiation with the notable exception that adequate prenatal care is associated with a
statistically significant increase in the probability of pre-term births. However, this difference is not particularly sur-
prising given that the number of observed visits relative to gestational age is a component of the index itself, meaning
that a mother with a set number of visits will be classified as having received adequate care if her infant is born at a
younger gestational age.
The final three outcomes in Table 3 indicate the extent to which prenatal care changes maternal behaviors during
pregnancy and influences outcomes through informational rather than purely clinical mechanisms. Across all fixed
effects specifications, we estimate that first trimester initiation of care is associated with a statistically significant in-
crease in the probability of an infant being born at high birth weight and of maternal weight gain during pregnancy.
Excessively high birth weight is viewed as an adverse outcome, meaning that the association between prenatal care and
high birth weight is almost definitely reflecting maternal behavioral changes during pregnancy rather than clinical
interventions. We also generally estimate that prenatal care is associated with a decrease in the probability of maternal
smoking during pregnancy, though this result is not statistically significant when controls other than maternal fixed
effects are excluded in column 2 and the point estimated impact in our preferred specifications in column 4 of 0.26
percentage points represents only a 1.5% decrease from baseline.
Impacts of prenatal care on early childhood health care utilization
5.3
Table 4 presents estimated impacts of prenatal care on early childhood health care utilization for three distinct types of
care: care received in an IP setting, an ED setting, and WCVs. We estimate prenatal care is associated with a statistically
significant increase in both WCVs and ED utilization along with a small but statistically significant decrease in the
number of IP stays, and all sets of results are qualitatively robust to the exclusion or inclusion of additional controls,
though the estimates are somewhat attenuated after controlling for demographics and year, county, and month fixed
effects. Additionally, they are quite stable to the inclusion of maternal risk factors, suggesting that feedback across
pregnancies is not a large concern. The estimated impact of first trimester initiation of care on both ED and WC Vs is

significant at a 1% level, while for future IP care utilization it is statistically significant across all specifications at the 5%
confidence level. When using the Kotelchuck index as our measure of prenatal care, the point estimated impacts of all
three types of care are moderately larger and all are significant at the 99% confidence level. The estimates in columns 4
and 5 suggest that prenatal care is associated with between a 5.6% and 6.9% increase in the number of claims in an ED

majority of infants in our sample have an initial hospital claim associated with birth; discounting this initial claim
would mean that our estimates in columns 4 and 5 suggest that prenatal care is associated with a 22.3% to 35.1%

On the whole, the results presented in Table 4 provide strong support for the theoretical prediction that prenatal
care influences maternal information, outlined in Equation (3), and provide evidence that the information effect in-
creases the demand for certain types of future health care. Our estimated impacts of health measured at birth as well as
the dissipation of any significant impacts on IP care after we control for birth weight suggest prenatal care likely
improves child health. Given that IP care is usually not directly demanded by patients, and is instead accessed through
either a primary care gatekeeper or referral from an ED, finding that prenatal care does not influence IP care through an
information effect seems plausible. However, if prenatal care is associated with better health status, as suggested by our
birth outcome and IP results, these results imply that the information effect of prenatal care must increase the demand
for both well visits and ED care and that these impacts are larger than any reduction in demand caused by better health.
Our estimates around WCVs can be interpreted in a similar way, although it seems plausible that the health effect
would be negligible for well child care.
5.4 Differential impacts of prenatal care by race
Table 5 splits our sample and presents the estimated impacts of first trimester initiation of prenatal care for white and
10
black mothers separately. We report estimates corresponding to column 4 in Tables 3 and 4 in columns 1 and 3, while
our results in columns 2 and 4 include controls for birthweight and correspond to column 5 in Table 4. We generally
estimate that prenatal care has a larger direct impact on health for infants of white mothers, with our percentage point
estimated impacts being larger for infant birthweight and the probability of being LBW, or SGA. Because infants born to
black mothers tend to have worse outcomes on average the point estimated impacts of prenatal care on the probability

of VLBW and NICU admission are smaller in relative terms for black mothers even though they are larger in absolute
terms. These results are similar to those found by Currie and Grogger (2002) and Sonchak (2015), who both estimated
that prenatal care visits had positive benefits on birthweight for white mothers but not for black mothers.
This relationship, however, flips when we look at outcomes that are more likely to be influenced through the in-
formation mechanism. We estimate that prenatal care is associated with larger relative changes in the probability of
smoking during pregnancy, having a high birth weight infant, and maternal weight gain for black mothers. Addi-
tionally, we estimate that early initiation of prenatal care only increases utilization of emergency care for infants of
black mothers and that it increases WCVs by nearly 100% more for black mothers than it does for white mothers. We
also estimate that prenatal care is only associated with decreased utilization of IP care for white mothers, though this
effect is only marginally significant and dissipates after controlling for birth weight, suggesting that these impacts may
largely be due to the improvements in infant health that are observed for children of white mothers.
On the whole, the results in Table 5 provide interesting insights that deserve further investigation in future work.
While they suggest that the direct health effects of prenatal care exist for both black and white mothers, they do appear
to be larger for white mothers. However, the informational mechanism, particularly as relates to future health care
utilization, appears to be much larger for black mothers. These results are quite consistent with the proposals suggested
by Gadson et al. (2017) to reduce racial disparities in maternal outcomes during pregnancy and outline the many ways
in which non-hispanic black mothers experience worse outcomes than other racial groups. Many of these innovations,
such as the CenteringPregnancy group prenatal care model which was rolled out in South Carolina during our study
period, do not substantively change the clinical aspects of prenatal care but do offer a wider range of opportunity for
provider interactions and the provision of information, and our results here support the hypothesis that these mech-
anisms may be particularly important for black mothers.
6 1 CONCLUSION
We estimate that prenatal care is associated with improved infant health as measured by observable outcomes at birth.
Across the board, our results for birth outcomes are consistent with the range of positive estimates reported in the
literature detailed by Corman et al. (2019). If IP health care utilization is a reasonable proxy for latent health status, our
results do suggest that prenatal care broadly improves child health during the first year of life, though our results also
suggest that at least some of this impact is driven by better health at birth. Finally, our results on the utilization of well
child care are entirely consistent with Reichman et al. (2010), lending them additional credibility.
Our results also suggest prenatal care is associated with increases in the future utilization of health care in most
settings, including ED care. According to figures presented in Lu and Kuo (2012), the national average cost
associated with a pediatric IP stay for an ACSC in 2006 was $9125, with a median cost of $6115. According to
figures presented in McWilliams et al. (2011), the average cost associated with a pediatric ED visit in 2007 in
Charlotte, NC for a condition related to an ACSC was $641 in 2006 dollars. Under the assumption that our
estimated changes in utilization are associated with conditions that cost an average amount to treat in each of
these settings, using the point estimates in Table 4 suggests that first trimester initiation of care is associated with a
net reduction of $65 in spending per child in emergency and IP settings within the first year of life, and that
adequate prenatal care was associated with a net reduction of $113 in spending per child in emergency and IP
settings within the first year of life. While these cost savings are modest, and are likely offset to some additional
extent by an increase in costs associated with additional utilization of primary care, they do suggest that the cost
savings from reducing future hospitalizations are at least large enough to balance out any increased costs from
additional ED care caused by increasing access to prenatal care.
As with all studies, there are some important caveats and limitations to note regarding the external validity of
our findings. First, it is important to reiterate that only mothers with multiple Medicaid eligible births are included
in our sample, meaning that our results may not generalize to mothers with only one child or those who are not
eligible for Medicaid. During the time period we look at, however, Medicaid does pay for a majority of births in
South Carolina, so the results are of interest even if they do not generalize beyond this group. Our sample also
only contains births occurring in South Carolina, and the results may not necessarily generalize to other states.
When comparing births in our data set from 2013 with National Birth Certificates data for 2013, it is clear that the
Medicaid eligible mothers in South Carolina are more disadvantaged than the average mother with a Medicaid paid
birth. In fact, mothers in our sample are younger, less educated, and are more likely to have poor birth outcomes


BERSAK AND SONCHAK-ARDAN

and various pregnancy risk factors than their whole-country peer group. Finally, there may be concerns that
tertiary factors, such as low Medicaid reimbursement rates, are acting as barriers to care and driving our results.
While it certainly seems plausible that access to care may be a determinant of both prenatal care and WCVs,
adequate access to care is not typically associated with increasing ED usage and so seems unlikely to drive our
results. If a different unobserved factor such as infant wantedness were driving our primary results it would still
not jeopardize our conclusion that mothers of infants tend to utilize well child care and emergency care in a
complementary fashion.
Although it is beyond the scope of what we are able to accomplish with this study, one particularly fruitful area
for future research will be to look at the path dependency of health care utilization. The totality of our results
appear most consistent with the explanation that prenatal care increases health care utilization, perhaps through
educating mothers about potential warning signs that could require urgent attention, and therefore helps mitigate
the severity of some early childhood ailments. The model and results we present here suggest the demand for
health care at a point in time is a function of prior health care consumed, and more work is needed in this area to
be able to make fully informed judgments as to the complete long run impacts and cost effectiveness of prenatal
care, as well as whether prenatal care is the most efficient means through which to provide maternal information.
Our results agree with the conclusion reached by Yan (2020) that expanding access to prenatal care would help
improve infant health at birth relative to the status quo. However, our hypothesized mechanisms also suggest that
expanding other community-based programs providing educational resources and support to mothers could
represent exciting opportunities for additional low cost interventions that may prove equally successful at
improving infant health through informational mechanisms.

In other words, beliefs about the entire distribution of shocks in both the presence and absence of care.
Procedure codes 99382 and 99392 are technically used for children age 1 to age 4, but we observe a small number of likely coding errors in
our sample from claims using these codes.
The reported point estimated impacts of prenatal care which follow are virtually identical to those obtained if we restrict the sample to
only those mothers who change prenatal care utilization across pregnancies.
Except for the outcomes of preterm birth and probability of being small for gestational age.
We do not aggregate previous poor birth outcomes. Rather, the data element provided by the state of South Carolina is coded as "Previous
poor birth outcomes." It is our understanding that this measure, along with our other prior birth outcomes, are reported as true if a
mother experienced a poor birth outcome in any previous birth.
For all reported estimates, errors are clustered at the level of the mother to allow for the influence of unobservables to be correlated across
births for each mother. However, all statistical inference is robust to clustering the errors at the county level to allow for unobservables to
be correlated geographically.
If, for example, changes in prenatal care across pregnancies are caused by unobserved changes in access to the health care system, it
would then mean that mothers with greater access to the health care system utilize both more primary and emergency department care.
Although not reported here, we also estimate that early initiation of prenatal care is associated with increases of roughly 0.1 additional
sick visits (those which do not originate in an ED nor are inpatient) or the conditions included in A1 within the first year of life, suggesting
that it is not solely access to care which is driving any observed increased utilization of emergency care.
Though not reported here, the results presented in this and all subsequent subsections are also robust to the inclusion of controls for
insurance payer at birth.
Though not reported, we find small (less than 1%) impacts of prenatal care on the extensive margin of any inpatient claims, any care in an
ED or any WCVs, and these impacts are only statistically significant for ED visits or WCVs.
Less than 2% of our final sample do not identify as white or black in our data and so are excluded from this analysis.

1. Introduction
ABSTRACT
Background: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurologic unit diseases that have different prevalence
in different parts of the world. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are associated with major fertility risks for
women of childbearing age. Due to the fact that studies on family planning methods in married women
with epilepsy (WWE) have not been conducted in Iran, the aim of this study was to evaluate the family
planning methods in married WWE in Birjand, Iran.
Methods: An analytical-descriptive study was performed on 126 married WWE hospitalized in the neu-
rology ward or referred to Vali-e-Asr specialized and sub-specialized clinic in Birjand. Demographic infor-
mation of patients as well as data on the type of used AED, and various methods of family planning were
collected in a questionnaire. Data analysis was performed using Chi-square and Fisher tests. All of the
above analyses were considered at a significance level of less than 5% by SPSS v. 19 software.
Results: The mean age of the patients was 33.41 ± 9.15 years. The mean age of experiencing the first sei-
zure and the onset of menstruation were 24.82 and 13.79 years, respectively. Fifty (35.5%), 38 (27%), 15
(10.6%), 14 (9.9%), and 14 (9.9%) patients used sodium valproate, carbamazepine, phenytoin, levetirac-
etam, and lamotrigine, respectively. The results showed that 72 sexually active patients (70.6%) used
family planning methods, of which 43 patients (59.7%) used withdrawal method, 20 patients (27.8%) used
condoms, and 6 patients (8.3%) used oral contraceptive pills (OCP). Eight patients (9.6%) had a history of
unintended pregnancy and 3 patients (3.6%) had a history of abortion.
Conclusion: It is recommended to apply effective family planning methods in married WWE to prevent
unintended pregnancies and the subsequent adverse effects in the fetus, considering the fact that a sig-
nificant percentage of WWE did not use effective family planning methods and 8 cases of unintended
pregnancies were reported. Because of high consumption of valproate in women of childbearing age in
our study and concerning issue about its fetal malformation, it is recommended to reduce the adminis-
tration of valproate in this population. Moreover, regarding the low consumption of folic acid, especially
for women of childbearing age and pregnant WWE who are taking AED, the necessary recommendations
should be made by our physicians.
Seizures and epilepsy are one of the most common diseases of
the nervous system [1 . Epilepsy has different prevalence in differ-
ent parts of the world, so that in the United States, its prevalence is
7 per 1000 people. There are no exact statistics in Iran, but in a
study conducted in 2005, the prevalence of epilepsy was reported

to be 1.8%
[2,3].
In this regard, in a meta-analysis performed by
Sayeh Miri, the prevalence of epilepsy in Iran was estimated at
around 5% in 2014
Epilepsy severely affects a patient's quality
of life due to a variety of problems it causes. On the other hand,
improper control of epilepsy in patients leaves irreparable financial
and cerebral complications
15].
Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are
associated with two major fertility risks for women of childbearing
age with epilepsy: first, the increased risk of unplanned pregnan-
cies due to AEDs with induction of liver enzyme properties that
reduce sex hormone levels after taking oral contraceptive pills


F. Ershadi, Seyed Mohammad Mousavi Mirzaei, N. Tabrizi et al.
(OCP); second, the increased risk of birth defects. Enzyme-inducing
AEDs associated with OCP failure include carbamazepine, pheny-
toin, phenobarbital, and primidone. These drugs reduce the estra-
diol levels in OCPs by approximately 40%, and may also reduce
free progestin levels by increasing sex hormone-binding globulins
(SHBG) 16 AEDs have teratogenic effects in infants, including mis-
carriage, neural tube defects, premature birth, and hypoxia. They
also may cause labor-like pains, postpartum hemorrhage, and
increased cesarean rates in mothers [7 . The mechanism of these
teratogenic effects is unknown in many cases, but in the case of
sodium valproate, it is stated that this drug interferes with ion
channels and thus causes side effects in various organs, especially
in the brain
The AED valproate has a 1—2% risk of developing
neural tube defects
[91.
Furthermore, mental development is
reduced by 40.8% in children exposed to valproate
[10].
The IQ
score of children exposed to valproate was the lowest, averaging
about 92, with 7 and 9 scores lower than carbamazepine and lam-
otrigine, respectively
. Some chronic teratogenic effects that
have been reported by these drugs include congenital heart dis-
ease, urogenital defects, hip dislocation, hydronephrosis, syn-
dactyly, and palate and cleft lip defects
[12-15].
Some of these
drugs are contraindicated during pregnancy
[16].
The awareness
of women with epilepsy (WWE) about the interaction of AEDs with
oral contraceptives and the potential for teratogenicity was evalu-
ated and little knowledge was observed in these patients
[17].
Other studies have also shown the importance of accurate and reg-
ular education of family planning methods in patients with epi-
lepsy to prevent the teratogenic effects of AEDs
[18].
Due to the
fact that studies on family planning methods in married WWE
have not been conducted in Iran yet, the aim of this study was to
evaluate the family planning methods in married WWE in Birjand,
Iran.
2. Material and methods
This analytical-descriptive study was performed on 126 mar-
ried hospitalized WWE in the neurology ward or patients referred
to Vali-e-Asr specialized and sub-specialized clinic in Birjand, Iran
(between September 2020 and April 2021 ). Inclusion criteria were
having informed written consent, being married, and being of
childbearing age. Exclusion criteria were dissatisfaction for enter-
ing the study, incomplete information, singleness, and age outside
the range of fertility. Demographic information of patients includ-
ing age, level of education, occupation, type of AED, various meth-
ods of family planning, and intended or unintended pregnancies of
patients was collected in a questionnaire. The obtained data were
reported using descriptive statistical indicators (quantitative vari-
ables as mean and standard deviation and qualitative variables as
number and percentage). Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were
used to compare the frequency distribution of variables. It should
be noted that all of the above analysis were considered at a signif-
icance level of less than 5% and were performed using SPSS v.19
software. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Bir-
jand University of Medical Sciences with the code IR.BUMS.
REC.1399.225.
3. Results
The mean age of the patients was 33.41 ± 9.15 years. The mean
age of experiencing the first seizure and onset of menstruation was
24.82 and 13.79 years, respectively. Demographic characteristics of
patients are summarized in Table 1. The majority of patients with
epilepsy were aged between 25 and 35 years. Fifty-two patients
(41.3%) had a diploma and most of them were housewives

of which 72 (70.6%) used family planning methods and the remain-

Evaluation of these applied family planning methods by studied
patients showed that 43 patients (59.7%) were using withdrawal
method (coitus interruptus), 20 patients (27.8%) condoms, 6
patients (8.3%) used combined hormonal contraception pills
(low-dose estrogen), 1 patient (1.4%) used injection of depo-
medroxy progesterone acetate, 1 patient (1.4%) used intra uterine
device (IUD), and 1 patient (1.4%) used tubectomy to prevent
unplanned pregnancy. Moreover, the evaluation of the number of
intended and unintended pregnancies showed that 83 cases
(65.9%) had a history of pregnancy, of which 8 patients (9.6%)
had a history of unintended pregnancy. Seventy-seven patients
(92.8%) had a history of neonatal birth and 3 patients (3.6%) had
a history of abortion. The results showed that 67 patients (53.2%)
were taking folic acid. Evaluation of AEDs used showed that 50
patients (35.5%) were consuming sodium valproate, 38 patients
(27%) carbamazepine, 15 patients (10.6%) phenytoin, 14 patients
(9.9%) levetiracetam, 14 patients (9.9%) lamotrigine, 4 patients
(2.8%) clonazepam, 3 patients (2.1%) phenobarbital, and 1 patient
(0.7%) topiramate. The results also showed that 47 patients
(56.6%) did not use any AEDs during pregnancy. Sixteen patients
(19.3%) had consumed levetiracetam, 12 patients (14.5%) had con-
sumed carbamazepine, 3 patients (3.6%) had consumed lamotrig-
ine, 3 patients (3.6%) had consumed sodium valproate, and 2
patients (2.4%) had consumed clonazepam during pregnancy. The
most common method of pregnancy prevention in patients with
academic education was condom, while among the three levels
of diploma, high school, and elementary education, the withdrawal
method was the most common. The results of Fisher test showed
that at different levels of education, the frequency of prevention
methods was not significantly different from each other
(p = 0.10). In different age groups, the most common method of
prevention was withdrawal. The results of Fisher test showed that
in different age ranges, the frequency of used pregnancy preven-
tion methods was not significantly different from each other
(p = 0.30). In the age group over 45 years, the most used AEDs were
sodium valproate and carbamazepine, while in other age groups,
sodium valproate was more commonly prescribed. The results of
Fisher test showed that at different age ranges, the frequency of
AEDs consumed was not significantly different from each other
(p = 0.57). There was no statistically significant difference between
the use or lack of using the family planning methods in different
age groups and the type of AED used (p > 0.05) (Tables 3 and 4)
However, we found a statistically significant difference between
the use or lack of using the family planning methods at different
levels of education (p = 0.04) (

To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first study that
has been conducted to evaluate family planning methods in mar-
ried WWE in Iran. Among 102 patients with sexual activity,
70.6% of the patients were using the family planning methods, with
withdrawal method being the most commonly used method
(59.7%). The remaining 30 patients (29.4%) did not use any family
planning methods despite receiving teratogenic drugs. The results
of our study showed that IUD, injection of depo-medroxy proges-
terone acetate, and tubectomy (1.4%) were the least used methods.
The pattern of family planning methods used among WWE in
developed and developing countries is different. In developing
countries, the family planning methods in WWE was reported only
in Senegal (51%) and Kenya (14.7%)
[19,201
. In a Senegalese cohort,
only 62 out of 120 (51.2%) WWE used contraception, with nearly
one-third of them (24/62) consuming oral contraceptive drugs.
Furthermore, 42 WWE concomitantly used hormonal family plan-
ning methods with AED including enzyme inducers, and two of
them (4.8%) became pregnant despite proper contraception
[19].
In a cross-sectional study in Kenya, 163 (85.3%) patients did not
use any type of family planning method during consumption of
AEDs. Only 14.7% WWE of reproductive age (15-49 years) were
using contraception. Of these, 39.3%, 14.3%, 7.1%, and 7.1% used
injectable, intra-uterine contraceptive device, condoms, and bilat-
eral tubal ligation (BTL), respectively
[20].
In developed countries,
several studies evaluated prescribing patterns of contraceptive in
WWE of childbearing age. For example, in the study by Bhakta
et al. 30 out of 115 (26%) WWE had a family planning method
Epilepsy & Behavior 129 (2022) 108618
when taking a potentially teratogenic AED. Of these, the majority
of patients (18/30, 60%) used an oral combined hormonal contra-
ceptive or progestin-only pill. Five (17%) WWE were on depot
medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 7 (23%) were on an IUD (either
levonorgestrel or copper)
[21].
Another retrospective survey on
WWE showed that 58% of patients used oral combined OCP for
[22].
It seems that the most common family plan-
contraception
ning method in developed or developing countries is oral contra-
ceptives, while most of WWE do not use proper contraception. It
should be noted that among the various methods of contraception
in WWE, IUD appears to be an appropriate candidate. This is
because the use of levonorgestrel-containing IUDs prevents unin-
tended pregnancies while does not alter epilepsy control and the
level of AEDs
[23].
Bosak's study suggested IUDs as an ideal contra-
ception for WWE
[23].
The first and second-line AEDs recom-
mended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in sub-
Saharan Africa (SSA) are as follows: phenobarbital, carbamazepine,
phenytoin, and valproic acid as the first-line and lamotrigine and
levetiracetam as the second line of treatment. First-line drugs are
associated with adverse outcomes for the fetus
In the present
study, the evaluation of prescribed AEDs showed that 35.5% of the
patients were consuming sodium valproate, 27% carbamazepine,
10.6% phenytoin, 9.9% levetiracetam, and 9.9Mamotrigine. In devel-
oped countries, one study was conducted to describe the pattern of
AED use in pregnant women and women of childbearing age dur-
ing a decade (2010—2019) in the Lombardy region of Italy. During
2019, 16,605 women of childbearing age (prevalence: 14.8%) were
prescribed at least one AED. Pregabalin was the most common AED
in women of childbearing age (22.3%) followed by valproic acid
(20%). In 2010, the prevalence of valproic acid in women of child-
bearing age was 30.2%. In 2019, this amount was 20%. Since 2017,
levetiracetam and lamotrigine have been the most commonly pre-
scribed drugs for pregnant women
[25].
Another study retrospec-
tively analyzed the use of valproate in pregnancy and in women
of childbearing age between 2014 and 2018 in Switzerland. The
most commonly used AED during pregnancy was lamotrigine, fol-
lowed by levetiracetam and pregabalin. Among women aged 15-
45 years, the most commonly used AED was pregabalin, followed
by lamotrigine, topiramate, and valproate. Valproate use decreased
from 28 per 10,000 women in 2014 to 21 per 10,000 women
126].
Also, "frequency of AEDs during pregnancy in participants" in
our study, indicated that 47 (56.6%) of pregnant mothers in this
study did not take any AEDs during pregnancy, 16 patients
(19.3%) took levetiracetam, and 12 patients (14.5%) took carba-
mazepine. In a study by Khomand et al., it was found that the most
commonly used drug by pregnant WWE was carbamazepine [271.
In both Nigeria
[28]
and Kenya
120],
carbamazepine was the most
commonly used AED by pregnant WWE; whereas in Senegal
[19],
phenobarbital was administered in up to 64.2% of pregnant
WWE. Although carbamazepine seems not be associated with a
significant increase in the risk of congenital malformations
[29],
a higher prevalence of congenital malformations of 5.5% has been
reported in recent studies
[30]
. Conversely, in developed countries,
the use of carbamazepine and valproate is declining. For example
in a study by Man et al. it was found that lamotrigine was increas-
ingly consumed during pregnancy compared to carbamazepine
and valproate
[31].
A retrospective study in WWE found that 80
women received lamotrigine, 27 women took levetiracetam, 7
women took carbamazepine, 7 took topiramate, 4 took oxcar-
bazepine, 2 took phenytoin, and 2 used valproate
[32].
Although the use of valproate is decreasing in women of child-
bearing age and pregnant women in developed countries, yet val-
proate is still one of the most commonly prescribed AEDs in
developing countries. Valproate is the best therapeutic option for
idiopathic (genetic) generalized epilepsies; however, it is associ-
ated with a high prevalence of fetal malformation and learning dis-

Aim. To suggest cut-off points for body mass index (BMI) using gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes
mellitus (GDM) as cardiometabolic conditions in pregnancy. Methods. In this prospective study, singleton pregnant women from
the fetal medicine service of the Brazilian Unified Health System were included. The pregnancy, perinatal, and newborn data were
obtained from the clinical medical records. Maternal anthropometry included an assessment of weight and height and the
prepregnancy BMI evaluation categorized according to the World Health Organization cut-off points. The area under the
curve and confidence interval values from receiver operator curves were generated to identify the optimal cut-off points using
prepregnancy BMI with better sensitivity and specificity. Results. Data on 218 pregnancies were analyzed, with 57.9% (n = 124)
being classified as overweight/obese, 11% (n = 24) with GDM, 6.9% (n = 15) with preeclampsia, and 11.0% (n = 24) with
gestational hypertension. The BMI cut-off points for predicting cardiometabolic conditions were 27.52 kg/m (S: 66.7%;
E: 63.8%) for women with GDM; 27.40kg/m2 (S: 73.3%; E: 62.4%; S: 79.2%; E: 64.9%; S: 70.3%; E: 66.3%) for women
2
with preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and gestational hypertension plus preeclampsia, respectively; and 27.96 kg/m
(S: 69.6%; E: 65.6%) for women with preeclampsia plus GDM. Conclusion. The findings suggest that the optimal prepregnancy
BMI cut-off point is around 27kg/m for pregnant women With maternal cardiometabolic conditions.
1. Introduction
The escalating prevalence of obesity is acknowledged as a
worldwide public health concern that impacts individuals
of all ages and genders [1]. Particularly among women of
childbearing age, the increasing incidence of obesity in Brazil
has significant implications for maternal health during preg-
nancy [2]. According to data from the Brazilian Food and
Nutrition Surveillance System [3], rates of prepregnancy
overweight and obesity have exhibited an upward trend, ris-
ing from 22.6% to 28.8% and from 9.8% to 19.8%, respec-
tively, between 2008 and 2018.
The body mass index (BMI) is a widely utilized measure
for assessing the nutritional status of populations, deter-
mined by measuring an individual's weight and height.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed

11 kg to 16 kg for those with a normal prepregnancy weight,
6 kg to 11 kg for individuals in the prepregnancy overweight
category, and 5 kg to 9 kg for those in the prepregnancy
obese category.
2.4. Statistical Analysis. Clinical and anthropometric data
were presented encompassing both quantitative and categor-
ical variables. A normality test was performed to evaluate the
distribution of quantitative variables. Quantitative variables
were summarized either using the mean and standard devi-
ation (±SD) or the median and interquartile range (IQR)
(median (p25 and p75)). Categorical variables were reported
with absolute frequencies (n) and their respective percent-
ages (%). To determine new BMI cut-off points during preg-
nancy, we generated area under the curve (AUC) values and
their corresponding confidence intervals from receiver oper-
ator curves (ROC). Pregnancies with adverse metabolic out-
come were used as an index to estimate the best predictive
sensitivities and specificities.
Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21.0 and the sig-
nificance level at p value < 0.05.
2.5. Ethical Aspects. The study received approval from the
Research Ethics Committee of the municipality of Porto Ale-
gre under the reference number 2.132.090. Prior to their par-
ticipation, pregnant women voluntarily provided written
informed consent.
3. Results
Total sample included 218 pregnant women screened in the
three trimesters of pregnancy. The mean (±SD) gestational
age at inclusion was 19.5 (±6.8) weeks, and the median age
was 25.0 (21—31) years, with 17.8% (n = 39) of women being
19 years old or younger.

Maternal, perinatal, and newborn characteristics are pre-
sented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Notably, 57.9%
(n = 124) of women exhibited overweight or obesity based
on their prepregnancy BMI. Concerning pregnancy out-
comes, 11.0% (n = 24) experienced gestational diabetes
(GDM), 6.9% (n = 15) had preeclampsia, and 11.0% (n = 24)
developed gestational hypertension. The majority of new-
borns, specifically 64.3% (n 162), had a birth weight exceed-
ing 3000 grams.
Appropriate maternal weight gain was achieved in 58%
of the sample, predominantly among pregnant women at
normal and obese weight gain. Overweight group presents
low adequacy regarding weight gain during pregnancy. Fur-
thermore, among pregnant women who experienced adverse
outcomes, the adequacy of weight gain was achieved in 25%
of those with diabetes, 28% of those with gestational hyper-
tension, and 14% of those with preeclampsia.
Table 3 highlights the ideal maternal BMI scores during
the pregestational period based on the cardiometabolic out-
come during pregnancy. It is noteworthy that the suggested
values reached statistical significance in relation to the stud-
ied outcomes.

GDM. The BMI threshold at 27.40 kg/m2 exhibited a sensitiv-
ity of 73.3% and a specificity of 62.4% in its predictive ability
for preeclampsia. Conversely, at the same BMI threshold of
27.40 kg/m2, it showed a sensitivity of 79.2% and a specificity
of 64.9% in predicting gestational hypertension.
When considering combined maternal health outcomes,
the selected cut-off points exhibited comparable perfor-
mance. Specifically, a threshold of 27.40 kg/m2 demonstrated
a sensitivity of 70.3% and a specificity of 66.3% for the com-
bined prediction of gestational hypertension and preeclamp-
sia, while a threshold of 27.96 kg/m displayed a sensitivity
of 69.6% and a specificity of 65.6% for the combined predic-
tion of preeclampsia and GDM.
Suggested BMI predictive capacity threshold regarding
outcomes during pregnancy is compared with traditional
adult thresholds in Table 4. New threshold of 27.4kg/m2
exhibits higher sensitivities and specificities compared to
adult BMI cut-off points for cardiometabolic conditions dur-
ing pregnancy.
4. Discussion
Our main finding was that the best prepregnancy BMI
threshold associated with cardiometabolic conditions during
pregnancy was around 27 kg/m . Sensitivity, considered the
most significant parameter in diagnostic evaluation,
achieved an approximate rate of 80% for gestational hyper-
tension and 73% for preeclampsia outcomes. Furthermore,
the ROC curve performance achieved a high AUC for gesta-
tional hypertension using a prepregnancy BMI threshold of
27.4 kg/m2.
Regarding the GDM outcome, BMI threshold of
27.4 kg/m reached the lowest score among the outcomes
studied with a sensitivity of 66%. However, the use of
the traditional adult BMI threshold of 30 kg/m2 showed
worse performance, reaching only 50% sensitivity in the
sample. Using the same traditional BMI of 30 kg/m as a
predictor of poor pregnancy outcome, an average sensitiv-
ity of 50% was found in relation to preeclampsia and ges-
tational hypertension.
Pooled analysis of cardiometabolic outcomes shows that
the new suggested BMI threshold of 27.4kg/m2 has better
performance in predicting preeclampsia plus gestational
hypertension and the association of preeclampsia plus
GDM. An average sensitivity of 70% was achieved in both
outcomes. The worst predictive performance of adult BMI
of 30kg/m was achieved in the combined outcome of pre-
eclampsia plus GDM, with a sensitivity of only 39%.


Journal of Pregnancy
Regarding weight gain during pregnancy, our sample
showed average adequacy of 58%, which is higher than the
international literature [16]. Research on weight gain during
pregnancy in Europe and North America reveals that ideal
weight gain is achieved in only 25% to 30% of pregnant
women. The majority of cases tend to exceed the limit,
resulting in overweight or obesity during labor and delivery
according to the adult BMI. This is partly due to limited
access to nutritional counseling or obtaining foods with a
lower glycemic index during pregnancy.
Selection of an appropriate BMI cut-off point for Brazilian
women has been examined, mainly due to the increasing prev-
alence of noncommunicable diseases, including obesity [17].
A recent study carried out in Brazil, focusing on women with
GDM, highlights a substantial increase in maternal obesity
between the 1990s and 2010 (11.1% to 46.4%). This highlights
the critical importance of prepregnancy monitoring for
women wishing to become pregnant [18].
Previous studies have focused on various cutoffs for preg-
nant women in different populations as part of efforts to
reduce chronic conditions. An illustrative case is a case-
control study carried out in Iran involving 270 singleton preg-
nancies, conceived through assisted reproductive technology.
This study identified a prepregnancy BMI of 25.4kg/m2 as
the threshold for an increased risk of GDM. The authors
found a sensitivity of 68.9% and a specificity of 62.8% [8].
Another retrospective cohort study that reviewed
11,494 medical records suggested that a lower prepreg-
nancy BMI cutoff of 25 kg/m2 to define obesity might be
appropriate for pregnant women in southern China. The
authors suggest that this approach would better predict
adverse obstetric and perinatal outcomes. Unlike the anal-
ysis in this article, the authors found that the prevalence of
obesity was 7.2% (BMI 2 25 kg/m2), due to the relatively
lean population [19].
A recent study of 11,136 pregnant women in China
focused on pregnancy outcomes and found a linear relation-
ship between poor outcome and increased prepregnancy
adult BMI. The authors evaluated gestational hypertension
with or without preeclampsia, GDM, cesarean section, post-
partum hemorrhage, small-for-gestational-age newborns,
and macrosomia. It was suggested that the ideal prepreg-
nancy BMI range was between 18.5 and 22.9kg/m2, with
the cut-off point for overweight being 23.0 kg/m2 and the
cut-off point for obesity being 28.0kg/m2 [20].
Adult BMI score compatible with obesity is considered a
strong predictor of general mortality among prospective epi-
demiological studies [21, 22]. In the context of pregnancy,
the application of adult BMI thresholds is constrained,
emphasizing that adult scores may result in low predictive
sensitivity for typical adverse pregnancy outcomes [6].
In our study, most women were classified as overweight/
obese prior to pregnancy, according to WHO criteria. These
findings align with the global increase in overweight and
obesity, which has reached epidemic levels in several coun-
tries [23]. In Brazil, a recent female cohort with 19,931 par-
ticipants found that the prevalence of overweight and
obesity more than doubled over the 33-year span, from
22.1% (1982) to 47.0% (2015) [24].
5
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 45 studies
revealed that prepregnancy overweight/obesity status increases
the risk of the newborn large for gestational age, macrosomia,
and subsequent offspring at risk of future overweight/obesity
[25]. Previous studies have shown that pregnancy obesity repre-
sents a risk factor for GDM [26], preeclampsia [26, 27], macro-
somia [27—29], and cesarean section [27, 28].
Among the new and more accurate techniques for pre-
dicting adverse pregnancy outcomes, the measurement of
maternal visceral adiposity using ultrasonography is becom-
ing promising. GDM outcome with measurements greater
than 4.7 cm in the Armellini region (distance from the linea
alba to the aortic cross in the maternal supraumbilical region
in the first 20 weeks) showed a significant odds ratio of 16.9
[30]. A similar study found a significant odds ratio of 14.4
among Armellini measurement greater than 4.5 cm in non-
obese prepregnant women [31]. Regarding the outcomes of
preeclampsia and premature birth with preeclampsia,
Armellini region measurement above 5.2 cm between 11
and 14 weeks of gestation showed a significant relative risk
of 3.1 and 16.9, respectively, even after control of concomi-
tant pregnancy conditions [32].
The study's main strength was the disease search at base-
line and during the hospitalization process for labor and
delivery, resulting in a GDM, gestational hypertension, and
preeclampsia double check. Furthermore, the study focused
in low-risk pregnant women, which simulates the majority
of outpatient care during pregnancy. Here, simple maternal
anthropometric measurements can become tools for
decision-making in clinical practice routine.
Limitations during the study unfortunately existed,
including self-reported prepregnancy weight, reported by
some patients when weight information was not available
in first-trimester prenatal records. However, several studies
demonstrated that using self-reported weight in pregnant
women and young adults is valid [33, 34]. Furthermore, total
weight gain during pregnancy was obtained in approxi-
mately 55% of the sample. This fact is due to the lack of rou-
tine measurement of maternal weight during hospitalization
to labor and delivery.
5. Conclusions
In summary, the present study suggests that the use of adult
BMI thresholds among pregnant women may not be univer-
sally applicable to all scenarios. Instead, adopting 27 kg/m2 as
a cut-off point threshold appears to be more effective in predict-
ing adverse pregnancy-related outcomes, achieving a better bal-
ance between sensitivity and specificity. This allows for early
identification of pregnant women at risk for common metabolic
outcomes of pregnancy with superior accuracy. Ultimately,
early implementation of rigorous clinical and nutritional care
will lead to better maternal and perinatal outcomes.
