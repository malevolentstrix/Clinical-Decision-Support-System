Study Population
All pregnant women with a gestational age of 15 to 43 weekswho delivered live births between January 1, 2005, and
December 31, 2014, and their offspring, were included in the
study. Women who were not residents of Alberta at the time
of delivery were excluded. A ﬂowchart (diagram) of the study
cohort selection is provided as Figure S1. Women with
syncope during pregnancy were identi ﬁed as those having an
International Classi ﬁcation of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9 )
code 780.2 or Tenth Revision (ICD-10 ) code R55 in any
diagnosis ﬁeld of their inpatient, outpatient, or physician
ofﬁce visit record during the gestation period. The ICD-9 and
ICD-10 codes of syncope have a moderate sensitivity of 63%,
high speci ﬁcity of 98% to 99%, and a positive predictive value
of 83% to 95%.

Demographic, Clinical, and Obstetric Data
In addition to maternal age at the time of delivery, the AlbertaHealth Care Insurance Population data were used to identify
women who had identi ﬁed themselves as Status Aboriginal.
This ﬂag was available for all residents before 2009.
Previously developed lists of surnames were applied to the
surnames in the Alberta Health Care Insurance Population
registry to identify pregnancies of women of South Asian and
Chinese ethnicity.
14–16These algorithms have been validated
against self-identi ﬁed ethnicity in the Canadian Community
Health Survey. Based on the ethnic distribution of the
population of Alberta, women who were not South Asian orChinese were most likely white and categorized as General
Population.
17Women were categorized as living in rural or
urban areas based on the ﬁrst numerical digit of their postal
code. The annual household income at the neighborhood level
from census data was used as a measure of socioeconomic
status.
Women with preexisting diabetes mellitus or cardiovascu-
lar disease or other medical conditions before pregnancy,
such as lupus, epilepsy, chronic obstructive pulmonarydisease, or liver disease, were identi ﬁed on the basis of the
delivery hospitalization and any previous hospitalizationClinical Perspective
What Is New?
Syncope during pregnancy, especially when it occurs during
theﬁrst trimester, may be associated with higher rates of
adverse outcomes including preterm births, congenitalanomalies, and an increased incidence of maternal cardiacarrhythmias and syncope in the ﬁrst-year postpartum.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
Given the observed higher rates of adverse outcomes
among women experiencing syncope in pregnancy, closermonitoring both during pregnancy and in the postpartum
period may be necessitated.

data. Given this paucity of evidence, we sought to describe
temporal trends in the incidence of syncope during pregnancy
using a large, contemporary, population-based cohort ofwomen in a de ﬁned geographic area with a single-payer
healthcare system with universal access. Additionally, neona-
tal outcomes, including rates of preterm birth, small for
gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age, and congen-
ital anomalies were examined, overall, and according to the
timing ( ﬁrst occurrence in ﬁrst, second, or third trimester),
and number ( ≥1) of syncope episodes during pregnancy. The
frequency of syncope and other cardiovascular events in the
mother in the year following the delivery was also evaluated.
Methods
Data for the study were received from the Alberta Ministry ofHealth (Alberta Health). The data are proprietary and not
available publicly. Aggregate data are available upon request.
Study approval was received from the University of Alberta
Ethics Board. Due to the retrospective, deidenti ﬁed nature of
the study, informed consent from participants was not required.
Study Design and Data Source
This retrospective cohort study used the longitudinal AlbertaPregnancy-Birth cohort,
8consisting of all live births between
January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, in the province of
Alberta, Canada. The cohort has been described in detail
previously.8–10In brief, the cohort was identi ﬁed from the
Alberta Vital Statistics —Birth Database, which contains
detailed birth information, including birth date, sex, birth
weight, gestational age, maternal age at delivery, singleton/
multiple birth status, and parity. Data from the Alberta Vital
Statistics —Birth Database were linked with the following data
for mothers and their offspring using a unique scrambledidenti ﬁer: (1) hospitalization data from the Discharge Abstract
Database; (2) ambulatory care data, including visits to the
emergency departments and hospital-based outpatient clinics,
from the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System
database; (3) physician of ﬁce visits from the practitioners
claims database; (4) demographic data from the Alberta
Health Care Insurance Population registry; and (5) date of
death from the Vital Statistics —Death Database. Data on the
neighborhood-level household income were obtained from the
2010 Population Census data.11

 Database) or ambulatory (National Ambu-
latory Care Reporting System) record as of April 1, 1997.
Pregnancy complications, including gestational diabetes mel-
litus and hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (including
preeclampsia and eclampsia), were identi ﬁed if they were
coded on the delivery hospitalization records. The complete
list of ICD codes used to identify clinical comorbidities is
provided in Table S1.
The delivery hospitalization record was used to identify
children who were born via cesarean section. On the basis ofprevious studies, large for gestational age and SGA were
deﬁned as birth weights <10% and >90%, respectively,
compared with neonates of the same gestational age and sex.
18
Outcomes
We examined the annual incidence of syncope during
pregnancy, as well as its overall incidence by trimester.
Neonatal outcomes, including rates of preterm birth (de ﬁned
as gestational age <37 weeks), SGA, low birth weight
(deﬁned as birth weight <2500 g), large for gestational age,
admission rates to the neonatal intensive care unit during the
delivery hospitalization, and congenital abnormalities were
compared in pregnancies with and without syncope, overall,
and by timing and frequency of syncope episodes. Maternal
outcomes of interest included the presentation of 1-year
postpregnancy syncope and cardiovascular events in the
mothers.
Statistical Analysis
The unit of analysis was the pregnancy, so women with >1
pregnancy within the study time period were included multiple
times. Pregnancies were ﬁrst categorized into 2 groups
according to the presence or absence of syncope and then
further categorized as follows: (1) into 4 groups according to
the timing of the ﬁrst syncope episode during pregnancy as
none, ﬁrst trimester, second trimester, and third trimester;
and (2) into 3 groups based on the number of syncope
episodes during the pregnancy as none, 1, and >1 episode.
All categorical variables are described as percentages and
were compared across groups using chi-square tests. Con-
tinuous variables are presented as medians with interquartile
range and were compared between groups using a nonpara-
metric Mann –Whitney Utest. We calculated incidence rates of
syncope during pregnancy per 1000 pregnancies for each
year of the study period. A Poisson regression model, with
year and maternal age as covariates, was used to assess
whether incidence rates had changed over time.
The unit of analysis for neonatal and congenital anomaly
outcomes was the child. The number of children included in
the study was larger than the number of pregnancies as aresult of nonsingleton pregnancies (ie, twins, triplets, etc).
Children were categorized according to whether they were
born to pregnancies of mothers with syncopal episodes, as
described above. All hospitalization (Discharge Abstract
Database), ambulatory (National Ambulatory Care Reporting
System), and practitioner claims records from birth to March
31, 2014, were examined to identify children with congenital
anomalies.
Because of the longitudinal nature of the pregnancy-birth
cohort, women may have had multiple pregnancies during thestudy time period or may have had multiple births for the
same pregnancy. To account for correlations across pregnan-
cies, we conducted supplementary analyses using generalized
estimating equation models with binomial distribution and
logit function to examine the association between syncope
during pregnancy and neonatal and congenital anomaly
outcomes in the offspring (Data S1).
Finally, hospitalization (Discharge Abstract Database),
ambulatory (National Ambulatory Care Reporting System),
and practitioner claims records in the year after delivery were
used to examine 1-year postpartum rates of syncope andother cardiovascular conditions (see Table S1 for full list of
codes).
All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software
(Version 9.4, SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, there
were 496 159 live births in Alberta, Canada. After excluding
births of women who were not residents of Alberta (n =5747)
and births with incorrect or incomplete data (n =351), the ﬁnal
study population consisted of 490 061 live births of 481 930
pregnancies (Figure S1).
Overall, 4667 of the 481 930 pregnancies had an episode
of syncope for an overall incidence rate of 9.7 per 1000
pregnancies (95% CI, 9.4 –10.0 per 1000 pregnancies). The
incidence rate of syncope during pregnancy increased from
7.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 2005 to 11 per 1000 pregnan-
cies in 2014 (Figure 1), equivalent to an age-adjusted 5%
increase per year (rate ratio, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.04 –1.06;
P<0.01).
Compared with women with pregnancies without syncope,
women who experienced syncope were younger (age
<25 years; 34.7% versus 20.8%; P<0.01), more likely primi-
parous (52.1% versus 42.4%; P<0.01), less likely to be married
(57.7% versus 69.8%; P<0.01) and had higher rates of
preexisting medical conditions (1.8% versus 1.0%; P<0.01;
Table 1). Women with syncope during pregnancy were also
more likely to have a history of syncope before pregnancy
compared with women without syncope during pregnancy
(11.5% versus 3.2%, P<0.01, Table 1). Although the rates of

Overall, 4667 of the 481 930 pregnancies had an episode

with syncope during pregnancy, there was no difference in the
rates of hypertensive disorders during pregnancy between the

occurred in the third trimester. Overall, 8% (377/4667) of
pregnancies with syncope had >1 episode.
Women experiencing a syncope episode had a higher rate
of preterm birth compared with women with no syncope
episode (16.3% versus 15.0%; P=0.02; Table 3). The rates of
preterm birth differed signi ﬁcantly by the time of the ﬁrst
syncope episode: women who experienced syncope during
theﬁrst trimester had the highest rates of preterm birth
(18.3%) compared with those with syncope during the second
(15.8%) and third (14.2%) trimesters ( P<0.01) (Figure 2).
Although higher than the rate of preterm birth in pregnancies
without syncope, there was no difference in preterm birth
rates among pregnancies with 1 versus >1 episode of
syncope.
With respect to neonatal outcomes, the slightly higher rates
of SGA and low birth weight in children of pregnancies with
syncope (10.5% and 7.5%, respectively) than in children of
pregnancies without syncope (9.7% and 6.8%, respectively) was
largely attributed to higher rates of these outcomes in
pregnancies with syncope in the ﬁrst and second trimesters
(Table 2). Multiple episodes of syncope during pregnancy wasnot associated with higher rates of adverse neonatal outcomes.
Looking beyond the neonatal period, over a median follow-
up period of 4.6 years (95% CI, 2.7 –7.1 years) for children of
pregnancies with syncope and 5.1 years (95% CI, 2.9 –
7.5 years) for children of pregnancies without syncope, the
rates of presentation of congenital anomalies was higher in the
former group (3.1%) than in the latter group (2.6%; P=0.023;Table 2). The highest prevalence of congenital anomalies was
observed among children of pregnancies in which the ﬁrst
episode of syncope occurred during the ﬁrst trimester (3.4%)
(Table 2). The incidence of congenital anomalies was signif-
icantly higher in children of pregnancies with multiple syncope
episodes during pregnancy than children of pregnancies with
only one episode (4.9% versus 2.9%; P<0.01).
Overall, 130 317 women had >1 pregnancy or birth during
the study time period. Results of generalized estimating
equation modeling accounting for correlations betweenoutcomes of mothers with multiple pregnancies/births are
presented in Figure S2. These analyses, adjusted for maternal
age, con ﬁrmed that women who experience the ﬁrst syncope
episode during the ﬁrst trimester had higher odds of preterm
birth (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1, 1.4; P=0.001), SGA (odds
ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0, 1.4; P=0.04), and congenital anomalies
(odds ratio, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0, 1.8; P=0.036) compared with
women with no syncope during pregnancy. The odds of
congenital anomalies were signi ﬁcantly higher in children of
pregnant women with multiple syncope episodes during
pregnancy than children of those with no syncope duringpregnancy (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3, 3.2; P=0.003).
Women with syncopal episodes during pregnancy had
higher rates of cardiac arrhythmias (0.8%) and syncopeepisodes (1.4%) within 1 year following delivery compared
with women with pregnancies without syncope (0.2% for
cardiac arrhythmias and 0.2% for syncope; P<0.01 for both;

Discussion
In a population-based study of 481 930 pregnancies between
2005 and 2014, we found the incidence of syncope during
pregnancy to be /C251.0% or 10 per 1000 pregnancies. The
incidence of syncope during pregnancy appears to beincreasing over time by 5% each year. The timing of syncope
during pregnancy may offer some prognostic information, as
rates of preterm birth were higher in pregnancies in which the
ﬁrst episode of syncope occurred during the ﬁrst trimester.
Although >1 syncope episode during pregnancy did not appear
to be associated with a higher rate of adverse neonatal
outcomes relative to pregnancies with only 1 syncopal episode,
the 5-year incidence of congenital anomalies was signi ﬁcantly
higher in the former group. Women with syncopal episodes

during pregnancy had higher rates of cardiac arrhythmias and
syncope in the year after delivery compared with women with no
syncope during pregnancy.
Our study is the ﬁrst to provide data on the population-level
incidence of syncope during pregnancy. The only other estimate
(published only in abstract form) is from a cross-sectional
survey of 174 postpartum women in which 4.6% self-report
experiencing syncope during pregnancy.7However, no infor-
mation about the cohort that was surveyed is available. In our
population-based analysis, we found the incidence of syncopeduring pregnancy to be /C251.0% or 10 per 1000 pregnancies. In
7814 participants from the general population enrolled in the
Framingham study, Soteriades et al
19found 822 patient-
reported cases of syncope over a 17-year follow-up period,
for an age-adjusted incidence of ﬁrst syncope of 7.2 per 1000
person-years. In this study, the incidence of syncope among
women aged 20 to 59 years ranged from 3.2 to 4.7 per
1000 person-years. More recently, Sandhu et al20reported an
age-sex standardized hospitalization rate (for a primary diag-
nosis of syncope) of 0.54 per 1000 population. Our ﬁndings
suggest that the incidence of syncope during pregnancy may beslightly higher than in the general population. The increased
rate of syncope in pregnancy may be attributable to physiolog-
ical changes occurring during pregnancy, but may also in part be
attributable to pregnant women being more likely to seek
medical attention for syncope during pregnancy.
We found a signi ﬁcant increase in the incidence of syncope
during pregnancy over time. This ﬁnding is consistent with
that reported in the general population. Ruwald et al
4found
that the incidence rate of syncope increased from 13.8 to19.4 per 100 person-years over a 12-year study period from
1997 to 2009. The highest rates of syncope in the general
population are observed among young ( <30 years) and older
(>65 years) individuals.
2Although mean maternal age
increased slightly over time (by 0.21 years per year in women
with syncope during pregnancy and 0.13 years per year in
women without syncope during pregnancy), there was no
signiﬁcant increase in the comorbidity burden over time in our
cohort of relatively young pregnant women (data not shown).
During pregnancy, the maternal circulation undergoes
hemodynamic, electrical, and structural changes.5These
include reduced systemic vascular resistance attributable to a
vasodilatory state, increased blood volume and heart rate, and
eccentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle. These changes may
contribute to an exaggerated vasovagal response during
pregnancy.6Other possible mechanisms include stimulation
of the nerve plexus located behind the uterus, causing re ﬂex-
mediated tachycardia followed by bradycardia, or compression
of the inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus, causing reduced
venous return to the heart.21More detailed clinical data are
needed to identify potential causes for the observed increase in
syncope during pregnancy in our study.In the only case report to document adverse fetal outcome,
maternal vasovagal syncope was associated with severe
prenatal encephalopathy.22Our data suggest that syncope
during pregnancy may not be a benign occurrence, as it was
found that syncope during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy
was associated with higher rates of preterm birth, SGA, and
low birth weight. The exact mechanisms explaining the
association between syncope during the early stages of
pregnancy and adverse neonatal outcomes remain unclear. It
is known, however, that a hypoxic maternal environment maybe detrimental to placental development as well as fetal
growth and may lead to potential consequences, including
intrauterine fetal growth restriction, premature delivery, and
preeclampsia.
23Ourﬁndings of the long-term consequences
of syncope during pregnancy, including the higher incidence
of congenital anomalies among children of pregnancies with
multiple syncope episodes as well as the higher maternal
rates of cardiac arrhythmias in the year following delivery in
women with syncope during pregnancy, require further study
and con ﬁrmation in other independent cohorts.
Although our study provides novel real-world data on the
incidence of syncope during pregnancy in a large population-
based cohort with universal health, it has a few limitations.
Our study may underestimate the true incidence of syncope,
as it does not account for women with symptoms of syncope
who may not have sought medical attention. Our diagnosis of
syncope was based on algorithms using ICD codes with
moderate sensitivity in administrative data sets,12,13and the
true incidence of syncope may thus have been underesti-
mated. Additionally, pregnancies that resulted in stillbirths ormiscarriages were not included in our database, thus leading
to potential further underestimation of the true incidence and
adverse neonatal outcomes of syncope in pregnancy.
Conclusions
In a large, contemporary, population-based cohort, we found
that the incidence of syncope during pregnancy is /C251.0%, and
is increasing over time. Pregnancies with syncope, especially
when it occurs during the ﬁrst trimester, may be associated
with higher rates of adverse outcomes, including higher ratesof preterm births and congenital anomalies and increased
incidence of maternal cardiac arrhythmia and syncope
postpartum. Whether women who experience syncope during
pregnancy may bene ﬁt from closer monitoring during the
obstetric and postpartum periods requires further study.

Supplementa l Analysis  
 
Due to the longitudinal nature of the pregnancy -birth cohort, there were 130,317 women who had more 
than one pregnancy during the study time period.  In addition, there were 8161 pregnancies that 
resulted in multiple births and 55 women had more than one multiple birth pregnancy in our study.   
 
To account for correlations acro ss pregnancies, we conducted supplementary analyses using 
generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with binomial distribution and logit function to examine 
the association between syncope during pregnancy and neonatal and congenital anomaly outcomes in  
the offspring.  
 
The GEE model accounts for multiple pregnancies from the same mother.  However, a pregnancy that 
resulted in multiple births is counted only once.  In the latter case, if any of the neonates born from the 
multiple pregnancy (i.e. twins, t riplets) developed the outcome of interest, that pregnancy was 
considered to have the outcome.  
 
For each outcome of interest three separate GEE models , including maternal age at delivery as a 
covariate in the model,  were executed: model 1 compared no synco pe vs. syncope; model 2 compared 
no syncope vs. syncope during first, second and third trimester and model 3 compared no syncope vs.1 
syncope episode and >1 syncope episode. Results are presented in Figure S2.

At 17+4week, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results of a 24-years-old mother showed high risk of monosomy
X (45, X). Abnormally shaped head and cardiac defects were observed in prenatal ultrasound scan at 19+3week.
Amniocentesis conducted at 19+3week identified karyotype 47, XX, +18, which suggested that the NIPT failed to
detect trisomy 18 (T18) in this case. With a further massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of maternal blood, fetal
and placental tissues, we found a confined placental mosaicism (CPM) with non-mosaic T18 fetus and multiclonal
placenta with high prevalence of 45, X and low level of T18 cells. FISH and SNP-array evidence from the placental
tissue confirmed genetic discrepancy between the fetus and placenta. Because the primary source of the fetal
cell-free DNA that NIPT assesses is mostly originated from trophoblast cells, the level of T18 placental mosaicism
may cause false negative NIPT result in this rare case of double aneuploidy.
Keywords: Non-invasive prenatal testing, Massively parallel sequencing, Mosaicism
Background
Non-invasive prenatal testing for common fetal aneu-
ploidies, in particular trisomy 21 and 18, by massively
parallel sequencing (MPS) of maternal plasma DNA is
an extremely efficient screening test with sensitivity and
specificity of over 99% [1].
Case presentation
Here we report a rare case with mosaic monosomy X and
trisomy 18 in placenta, which in duced a false negative NIPT
result. Results of the 2nd trimester combined test (AFP
0.65 MoM and hCGb 4.32 MoM) indicated that the preg-
nancy of the 24-year-old mother ( “g r a v i d a2 ,p a r a0 ”, G2P0)
was at high risk of Down syndrome (1/45). As the following
screening, a NIPT test was then performed at 17+4week
of gestation by maternal peripheral blood collection,cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extraction, library construction
and sequencing through Illumina HiSeq2000 platform [2].
However, the NIPT did not reveal risks of fetal trisomy
13, 18 or 21, but demonstrated a great probability of 45,
X. This was a female fetus. The t-score for chromosome
18 was −0.52, but for chromosome X was about −4.05,
which suggests that the NIPT result was 45, X. Ultra-
sound scan at 19+3week showed strawberry-shaped head
and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (Figure 1). After
consulting, the patient agreed to take a further amnio-
centesis for confirmation of NIPT results. G-banding of
amniocytes cultivation identified the fetal karyotyping
result as 47, XX, +18 (Figure 2) and implied that the
NIPT had given a false negative result of T18. After
post-test consultation, the couple decided to terminate
pregnancy and agreed on additional research. Sequen-
cing results of NIPT (Figure 3) identified the aborted
fetal tissue as T18 condition, while the placental tissue
as a status of mosaic T18 (mosaic ratio nearly 30%) and
45, X (mosaic ratio nearly 60%), which was in agreement
with the amniocentesis result. Moreover, FISH analyses
using chromosome 18 and X specific probes on placen-
tal tissues identified a combination of 45, X and T18* Correspondence: njfybjyhuping@163.com ;rosening@163.com

Abstract
At 17+4week, non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) results of a 24-years-old mother showed high risk of monosomy
X (45, X). Abnormally shaped head and cardiac defects were observed in prenatal ultrasound scan at 19+3week.
Amniocentesis conducted at 19+3week identified karyotype 47, XX, +18, which suggested that the NIPT failed to
detect trisomy 18 (T18) in this case. With a further massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of maternal blood, fetal
and placental tissues, we found a confined placental mosaicism (CPM) with non-mosaic T18 fetus and multiclonal
placenta with high prevalence of 45, X and low level of T18 cells. FISH and SNP-array evidence from the placental
tissue confirmed genetic discrepancy between the fetus and placenta. Because the primary source of the fetal
cell-free DNA that NIPT assesses is mostly originated from trophoblast cells, the level of T18 placental mosaicism
may cause false negative NIPT result in this rare case of double aneuploidy.

Background
Non-invasive prenatal testing for common fetal aneu-
ploidies, in particular trisomy 21 and 18, by massively
parallel sequencing (MPS) of maternal plasma DNA is
an extremely efficient screening test with sensitivity and
specificity of over 99% [1].
Case presentation
Here we report a rare case with mosaic monosomy X and
trisomy 18 in placenta, which in duced a false negative NIPT
result. Results of the 2nd trimester combined test (AFP
0.65 MoM and hCGb 4.32 MoM) indicated that the preg-
nancy of the 24-year-old mother ( “g r a v i d a2 ,p a r a0 ”, G2P0)
was at high risk of Down syndrome (1/45). As the following
screening, a NIPT test was then performed at 17+4week
of gestation by maternal peripheral blood collection,cell-free DNA (cfDNA) extraction, library construction
and sequencing through Illumina HiSeq2000 platform [2].
However, the NIPT did not reveal risks of fetal trisomy
13, 18 or 21, but demonstrated a great probability of 45,
X. This was a female fetus. The t-score for chromosome
18 was −0.52, but for chromosome X was about −4.05,
which suggests that the NIPT result was 45, X. Ultra-
sound scan at 19+3week showed strawberry-shaped head
and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (Figure 1). After
consulting, the patient agreed to take a further amnio-
centesis for confirmation of NIPT results. G-banding of
amniocytes cultivation identified the fetal karyotyping
result as 47, XX, +18 (Figure 2) and implied that the
NIPT had given a false negative result of T18. After
post-test consultation, the couple decided to terminate
pregnancy and agreed on additional research. Sequen-
cing results of NIPT (Figure 3) identified the aborted
fetal tissue as T18 condition, while the placental tissue
as a status of mosaic T18 (mosaic ratio nearly 30%) and
45, X (mosaic ratio nearly 60%), which was in agreement
with the amniocentesis result. Moreover, FISH analyses
using chromosome 18 and X specific probes on placen-
tal tissues identified a combination of 45, X and T18* Correspondence: njfybjyhuping@163.com ;rosening@163.com

and relatively low abundance of T18 cells (30%, 28/92)
in total (Figure 4). This is also confirmed by SNP-array
results of placental samples which offered clear evidence
for the various level of 45, X and T18 mosaicism. The
SNP-array results (Figure 5) with the signal intensity
(logR) and genotyping (B allele frequency, BAF) value
plots indicated the mosaic rearrangements. The increased
logR and altered BAF value (Figure 5B) suggested a mo-
saic trisomy of chromosome 18 in 50% of the cells. The
level of mosaicism was determined based on both logR
and BAF value [3]. Notably, the result indicated partial
duplication for the distal section of 18q represented in
17% of the cells, which was evidenced by the observa-
tion of two additional chromatin segments attached to achromosome 18 in the FISH results (Figure 4). On the
other hand, large mosaic deletion ranging in size from
31.05 to 93.16 Mb of chromosome X was illustrated in
Figure 5C. The decreased logR and abnormal heterozy-
gous BAF value indicated a mosaic monosomy at the
level of 67%, which showed good agreement with the
FISH results.
To the contrary, G-banding, FISH and SNP-array ana-
lyses on the post-mortem fetal tissue all demonstrated
positive results of complete T18, showing that the fetal
tissue is genetically different from the placental tissue.
Analysis and conclusion
It is acknowledged that fetal cfDNA in maternal periph-
eral blood is originated from trophoblast and mainly

cordance between placental and fetal tissue may affect the
NIPT test and lead to inaccurate results. False positive
NIPT results, small but not negligible, have been reported
and noted for concern in these years [6-8]. In addition,mosaic condition of placenta may reduce the measure-
ment accuracy and cause false negative result. The present
case offered strong evidence for the idea and was sup-
ported by a previous case of double trisomy in placenta
[9]. In this case, the fraction of fetal cfDNA for T18

detection threshold of NIPT test and consequently caused
false negative results. Therefore, the level of mosaicism is
an important factor for the NIPT test.
Collectively, considering the effect from placenta, the
NIPT results should be interpreted combining other clin-
ical tests under comprehensive background information.

Purpose of review— To briefly review results of the latest research on the contributions of 
depression, anxiety, and stress exposures in pregnancy to adverse maternal and child outcomes, 
and to direct attention to new findings on pregnancy anxiety, a potent maternal risk factor.
Recent findings— Anxiety, depression, and stress in pregnancy are risk factors for adverse 
outcomes for mothers and children. Anxiety in pregnancy is associated with shorter gestation and 
has adverse implications for fetal neurodevelopment and child outcomes. Anxiety about a 
particular pregnancy is especially potent. Chronic strain, exposure to racism, and depressive 
symptoms in mothers during pregnancy are associated with lower birth weight infants with 
consequences for infant development. These distinguishable risk factors and related pathways to 
distinct birth outcomes merit further investigation.
Summary— This body of evidence, and the developing consensus regarding biological and 
behavioral mechanisms, sets the stage for a next era of psychiatric and collaborative 
interdisciplinary research on pregnancy to reduce the burden of maternal stress, depression, and 
anxiety in the perinatal period. It is critical to identify the signs, symptoms, and diagnostic 
thresholds that warrant prenatal intervention and to develop efficient, effective and ecologically 
valid screening and intervention strategies to be used widely.

The purpose of this article is to briefly review results of the latest research on effects of 
negative affective states (referring throughout to anxiety and depression) and stress 
exposures in pregnancy, mainly regarding effects on birth outcomes. We direct attention 
specifically to recent research on pregnancy anxiety, a newer concept that is among the most 
potent maternal risk factors for adverse maternal and child outcomes [ 1■■]. By highlighting 
these developments, we hope to encourage synthesis and new directions in research and to 
facilitate evidence-based practices in screening and clinical protocols.
Psychiatric research on pregnancy focuses mostly on diagnosable mental disorders, 
primarily anxiety, and depressive disorders [ 2,3] and somewhat on posttraumatic stress 
disorder following adverse life events or childbirth experiences. However, a large body of 
scientific research outside psychiatry provides extensive information on a wide range of 
clinical symptoms during pregnancy, as measured with screening tools such as the 
Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS), for example, the Beck Depression 
Inventory, or the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Scores on these 
measures are sometimes dichotomized in order to create depressed/nondepressed groups of 
women as a proxy for diagnostic categories, but continuous scores of symptom severity are 
more often used in research. Symptoms typically show linear or dose–response associations 
with outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), or infant 
abnormalities. Our current understanding of negative affective states in pregnancy is based 
largely on these studies of symptomatology, not investigations of confirmed diagnoses, 
perhaps because investigators lacked clinical expertise or funding to conduct diagnostic 
interviews. More studies of confirmed diagnoses would be helpful, particularly with larger 
samples and controlling for antidepressant medications and other relevant variables. 
Nonetheless, research findings on symptoms of anxiety and depression in pregnancy are 
informative for clinicians regarding prenatal screening, early detection, prevention, and 
treatment of perinatal mood disturbances among expecting and new mothers.
Estimates of the prevalence of depression during pregnancy vary depending on the criteria 
used, but can be as high as 16% or more women symptomatic and 5% with major depression 
[2]. Firm estimates for prenatal anxiety do not exist, nor is there agreement about 
appropriate screening tools, but past studies suggest that a significant portion of women 
experience prenatal anxiety both in general and about their pregnancy [ 1■■,3]. Evidence of 
high exposure to stress in pregnancy is more widely available, at least for certain subgroups 
of women. For example, a recent study of a diverse urban sample found that 78% 
experienced low-to-moderate antenatal psychosocial stress and 6% experienced high levels 
[4]. Some of the stressors that commonly affect women in pregnancy around the globe are 
low material resources, unfavorable employment conditions, heavy family and household 
responsibilities, strain in intimate relationships, and pregnancy complications.
A large body of research is now available regarding stress and affective states during 
pregnancy as predictors of specific pregnancy conditions and birth outcomes [ 5,6]. The most 
commonly studied are PTB (<37 weeks gestation) and LBW (≤2500 g). Both are of US and 
international significance due to high incidence in many parts of the world and also Dunkel Schetter and Tanner Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptconsequences for infant mortality and morbidity. It has been estimated that two-thirds of 
LBW infants are born preterm. Thus, there are likely to be both common and unique 
etiological pathways [ 1■■,7■■]. Current theoretical models emphasize biopsychosocial and 
cultural determinants and interactions of multiple determinants in understanding these birth 
outcomes [ 8,9■■,10–12].
STRESS IN PREGNANCY
The literature on stress in pregnancy and birth outcomes is reviewed in two subsections, one 
on PTB and the other on LBW.
Stress and preterm birth
More than 80 scientific investigations on stress and PTB were recently reviewed by Dunkel 
Schetter and Glynn [ 7■■], of which a majority had prospective designs, large samples, and 
validated measures, and were fairly well controlled for confounds such as medical risks, 
smoking, education, income, and parity. These studies can be grouped by the type of stress 
examined. Of the more than a dozen published studies assessing `major life events in 
pregnancy', a majority found significant effects; women who experienced major life events 
such as the death of a family member were at 1.4 to 1.8 times greater risk of PTB, with 
strongest effects when events occurred early in pregnancy. The majority of a second, smaller 
group of studies on catastrophic, community-wide disasters (e.g., earthquakes or terrorist 
attacks) also showed significant effects on gestational age at birth or PTB. A third small set 
of studies on chronic stressors, such as household strain or homelessness, all reported 
significant effects on PTB. Finally, a majority of past investigations on neighborhood 
stressors such as poverty and crime indicated significant effects on gestational age or PTB. 
In comparison, studies on daily hassles and perceived stress did not consistently predict 
PTB. Thus, of the many distinguishable forms of stress, many (but not all) contribute to the 
risk of PTB.
Stress and low birth weight
A second area of developing convergence concerns the effects of stress on infant birth 
weight and/or LBW, reviewed recently by Dunkel Schetter and Lobel [ 9■■]. Again these 
studies can be organized by type of stressor. Evidence suggests that `major life events' 
somewhat consistently predicted fetal growth or birth weight, whereas measures of 
`perceived stress' had small or nonsignificant effects. `Chronic stressors', however, have 
been even more robust predictors of birth weight. For example, unemployment and 
crowding predicted 2.0 to 3.8 times the risk of LBW among low-income women in one 
study [ 13]. An important source of chronic stress is `racism or discrimination' occurring both 
during the pregnancy and over a woman's lifetime [ 14]. Racism and discrimination 
contribute to birth outcomes independently of other types of stress [ 15]. A growing number 
of studies have demonstrated that racism and discrimination prospectively predict birth 
weight, particularly in African–American women [ 16]. Although this literature has focused 
mainly on women in the USA, it is relevant to minority women in other countries [ 17].Dunkel Schetter and Tanner Page 3
Curr Opin Psychiatry . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIn summary, chronic strain, racism, and related factors such as neighborhood segregation are 
significant risk factors for LBW [ 18]. Of note, investigations of chronic stress and racism do 
not usually take into account depressive symptoms. Yet, depression may be an important 
mechanism whereby the effects of exposure to chronic stress and racism influence fetal 
growth and birth weight, likely via downstream physiological and behavioral mechanisms 
[9■■].
ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSED AFFECT IN PREGNANCY
Recent research on symptoms of anxiety and depression during pregnancy is reviewed 
similarly within two subsections distinguishing findings on PTB from those on LBW.
Affect and preterm birth
State anxiety during pregnancy significantly predicted gestational age and/or PTB in seven 
of 11 studies recently reviewed [ 7■■], but only in combination with other measures or in 
subgroups of the sample. More consistent effects have been found for `pregnancy anxiety' 
(also known as `pregnancy-specific anxiety' and similar to `pregnancy distress'). Pregnancy 
anxiety appears to be a distinct and definable syndrome reflecting fears about the health and 
well being of one's baby, of hospital and health-care experiences (including one's own health 
and survival in pregnancy), of impending childbirth and its aftermath, and of parenting or 
the maternal role [ 1■■,19]. It represents a particular emotional state that is closely 
associated with state anxiety but more contextually based, that is, tied specifically  to 
concerns about a current pregnancy. Assessment of pregnancy anxiety has entailed ratings of 
four adjectives combined into an index (`feeling anxious, concerned, afraid, or panicky 
about the pregnancy [ 20]' or use of a 10-item scale reflecting anxiety about the baby's 
growth, loss of the baby, and harm during delivery, as well as a few reverse-coded items 
concerning confidence in having a normal childbirth) [ 21]. Other measures exist as well.
There is remarkably convergent empirical evidence across studies of diverse populations 
regarding the adverse effects of pregnancy anxiety on PTB or gestational age at birth [ 7■■,
19]. More than 10 prospective studies have been conducted on this topic, all of which report 
significant effects on the timing of birth. An early study found that the 10-item scale scores 
combined with a standard measure of state anxiety predicted gestational age of the infant at 
birth, controlling for medical risk factors, ethnicity, education, and income; these results 
were also independent of the effects of a woman's personal resources (sense of mastery, self-
esteem, and dispositional optimism) [ 21]. Use of multidimensional modeling techniques 
later revealed that state anxiety, pregnancy anxiety, and perceived stress all predicted the 
length of gestation, but pregnancy anxiety (as early as 18 weeks into pregnancy) was the 
only significant predictor when all three indicators were tested together with medical and 
demographic risks controlled [ 20]. At least three large, well controlled, prospective studies 
have replicated these results using similar pregnancy anxiety measures [ 22–24]. The largest 
of these was a prospective study of 4 885 births finding that women with high pregnancy 
anxiety were at 1.5 times greater risk of a PTB, controlling for socio-demographic 
covariates, medical and obstetric risks, and specific worries over a high-risk condition in 
pregnancy [ 23].Dunkel Schetter and Tanner Page 4
Curr Opin Psychiatry . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIn sum, recent evidence is remarkably convergent, indicating that pregnancy anxiety predicts 
the timing of delivery in a linear manner. Further, pregnancy anxiety predicts risk of 
spontaneous PTB with meaningful effect sizes across studies, comparable to or larger than 
effects of known risk factors such as smoking and medical risk. These effects hold for 
diverse income and ethnic groups in the USA and in Canada. The consistency of these 
findings paves the way for investigating the antecedents and correlates of pregnancy anxiety, 
mechanisms of effects, and available treatments.
In contrast, relatively few of the more than a dozen studies on depressed mood or symptoms 
of trauma found significant effects on gestational age or PTB [ 9■■]. A Swedish study found 
that elevated antenatal depressive symptoms predicted increased risk for PTB [odds ratio 
(OR) = 1.56] [ 25], and a recent meta-analysis concluded that PTB was associated with 
depression across 11 studies. However, in general, effect sizes were relatively small across 
studies with an average OR of 1.13 [confidence interval (CI 1.07–1.30)] [ 26].
Affect and low birth weight
Recent evidence points more often to the role of maternal depressive symptoms in the 
etiology of LBW as compared with the etiology of PTB [ 27■■]. The recent meta-analysis on 
depression in pregnancy, cited earlier, evaluated 20 studies and found that high depressive 
symptoms were associated with 1.4 to 2.9 times higher risk of LBW in undeveloped 
countries, and 1.2 times higher risk on average in the USA [ 26]. Another recent review 
found relatively large effects of maternal depressive symptoms on infant birth weight across 
several studies, with the largest effects for low-income or low social status women and 
women of color [ 9■■]. Furthermore, although there are few studies on diagnosed disorders, 
one study reported that mothers with a depressive disorder had 1.8 times greater risk of 
giving birth to a LBW infant [ 28]. Thus, evidence appears to be stronger for contributions of 
depressive symptoms or disorder to slower growth of the fetus and LBW than to the timing 
of delivery or PTB, and these effects are pronounced for disadvantaged women [ 29]. In 
contrast, very few studies have demonstrated any effects of anxiety on LBW, with rare 
exceptions [ 30].
STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE STATES IN PREGNANCY AND 
INFANT OR CHILD OUTCOMES
Evidence for effects of maternal stress, depression, and anxiety in pregnancy on adverse 
neurodevelopmental outcomes for the child is substantial [ 31], through a process known as 
`fetal programming' [ 5,32]. Research utilizing animal models indicates that maternal distress 
negatively influences long-term learning, motor development, and behavior in offspring 
[33,34]. Evidence suggests that this occurs via effects on development of the fetal nervous 
system and alterations in functioning of the maternal and fetal hypothalamic pituitary 
adrenal (HPA) axes [ 34–36]. Maternal mood disorders have also been shown to activate the 
maternal HPA axis and program the HPA axis and physiology of the fetus [ 37,38]. In short, 
a mother's stress exposure and her affective states in pregnancy may have significant 
consequences for her child's subsequent development and health [ 5,39–43]. This evidence 
has been reviewed in many articles and spans effects on attention regulation, cognitive and Dunkel Schetter and Tanner Page 5

of life; behavioral and emotional problems and decreased gray matter density in childhood; 
and impulsivity, externalizing, and processing speed in adolescents [ 44–47]. Of note, many 
of these findings involve the effects of prenatal pregnancy anxiety on infant, child, or 
adolescent outcomes. Maternal stress has also been linked to major mental disorders in 
offspring [ 40,47].
SUMMARY AND KEY ISSUES
In summary, there is substantial evidence that anxiety, depression, and stress in pregnancy 
are risk factors for adverse outcomes for mothers and children. More specifically, anxiety in 
pregnancy is associated with shorter gestation and has adverse implications for fetal 
neurodevelopment and child outcomes. Furthermore, anxiety about a particular pregnancy 
seems to be especially potent. Finally, chronic strain, exposure to racism, and depressive 
symptoms in mothers during pregnancy are associated with lower birth weight infants with 
consequences for development as well. These differential risk factors and related pathways 
to PTB and LBW deserve further investigation. Beyond this, women with high stress, 
anxiety, and depressive symptoms in pregnancy are more likely to be impaired during the 
postpartum period. Postpartum affective disturbance and stress in turn impair parenting 
quality and effectiveness [ 48]. Figure 1 summarizes the evidence that has been briefly 
reviewed in a simple schematic with connections in bold representing those with notably 
stronger and more consistent evidence. This simple diagram can be elaborated further to 
include associations among the various types or forms of stress and to include mediated 
pathways to birth outcomes. For example, major life events or community catastrophes can 
be hypothesized to increase pregnancy anxiety, and long-term chronic strain to increase risk 
of depression. The effects of chronic strain on LBW via depression are also not depicted but 
are worthy of further research. Together, the evidence and developing consensus that 
biological and behavioral mechanisms explain these findings lay the groundwork for a next 
era of psychiatric and collaborative interdisciplinary research on pregnancy.
Why pregnancy anxiety?
It is not clear why `pregnancy anxiety' has such powerful effects on mothers and their 
babies. In fact, the nature of this concept has not yet received sufficient attention to be fully 
explicated. Possibly what makes it potent is that measures of pregnancy anxiety capture both 
dispositional characteristics, or traits, and environmentally influenced states. For example, 
women who are most anxious about a pregnancy seem to be more insecurely attached, of 
certain cultural backgrounds, more likely to have a history of infertility or to be carrying 
unplanned pregnancies, and have fewer psychosocial resources [ 49]. These results suggest 
that existing vulnerabilities that predate pregnancy may interact with the social, familial, 
cultural, societal, and environmental conditions of pregnancy to increase levels of pregnancy 
anxiety, producing effects on the maternal–fetal–placental systems, especially during 
sensitive periods such as early pregnancy. This process can then adversely influence fetal 
development by programming the fetus's HPA axis and also have effects on the initiation of 
labor via maternal, fetal, and placental hormonal exchanges. Although there is much we do 
not know, a worthwhile future goal for clinical researchers may be to identify women high Dunkel Schetter and Tanner Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptin anxiety before conception, as well as women high in anxiety during pregnancy, and 
especially those women who are anxious about specific aspects of their pregnancies – about 
this child and this birth, and about competently parenting with this partner. These women 
would appear to be targets for early intervention such as evidence-based interventions for 
stress reduction, mood regulation treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapies, 
pharmacological treatments, and follow-up care during postpartum to prevent a range of 
adverse outcomes for mother, child, and family.
Clinical screening for affective symptoms in pregnancy
Clinical screening for depression or anxiety in prenatal and postpartum healthcare has been 
widely recommended but is also potentially problematic. The issues concern what screening 
tools to use; what cutoffs to adopt for identifying women at risk; the need for expert 
clinicians to follow up on those women who score above thresholds to make diagnoses; and, 
for those who have established diagnoses, the availability of affordable and efficacious 
treatments [ 50]. These issues must be resolved for prenatal (and postpartum) clinical 
screening to be recommended widely. For example, the EPDS, which is a gold standard used 
widely in clinic settings for depression screening both prepartum and postpartum, actually 
measures both depressive and anxiety symptoms, which may contribute to confusion about 
risks [ 51]. In addition, experts have questioned the validity of a diagnosis of depressive 
disorders using standard diagnostic criteria for mood disturbance because they include 
typical somatic symptoms of pregnancy such as fatigue, sleep disturbance, and appetite 
changes [ 52]. Also relevant is one recent study reporting that women with both depression 
and anxiety disorders were at highest risk of LBW, as compared with those with only 
depressive or anxious symptoms or none [ 53]. Combinations of symptoms have received 
very little research attention. Furthermore, little research thus far has examined the 
feasibility and utility of screening for prenatal stress or pregnancy anxiety.
If broad screening for affective symptoms during pregnancy results in high rates of false-
positive results, low rates of clinical follow-up and referral, insufficient or ineffective 
education for women about the meaning of screening results, lack of treatment, and/or 
absence of proven evidence-based interventions, then clinical screening as a standard 
procedure in specific prenatal settings is of questionable value. Nonetheless, if important 
preconditions can be met, screening for pregnancy anxiety, state anxiety, depressive 
symptoms, and stress in pregnancy stands to provide potentially important clinical benefits 
for mothers and their children [ 54,55].
The broader context of pregnancy
An essential consideration in implementing widespread effective prenatal screening, 
diagnosis, and treatment is the context of a woman's pregnancy. The context includes her 
partner, family, friends, neighborhood, and larger community, all of which are known to 
influence a woman's mental health and responses to a diagnosis of disorder. Therefore, 
attention must be paid to these levels of influence in any attempts to screen and treat 
depression, anxiety, pregnancy anxiety, or stress in pregnancy. For example, a woman's 
ability to understand or respond to a diagnosis of a mood or anxiety disorder and accept 
treatment may be facilitated by involving her partner, closest relative, or friend in follow-up Dunkel Schetter and Tanner Page 7
Curr Opin Psychiatry . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 May 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptafter screening. Families and communities can undermine or enhance efforts to screen and 
treat women in pregnancy as a result of their beliefs, values, and level of information (or 
misinformation). Although these issues are known barriers to community mental health 
treatment in diverse populations, they have not yet been addressed in establishing 
appropriate clinical procedures in pregnancy for follow-up of widespread screening for 
affective disorders. It may also be useful to identify a range of protective and resilience 
factors such as mastery, self-efficacy and social support in women for the purpose of 
intervention planning [ 2,56■■]. If efforts are directed to strengthening women's 
psychosocial resources as early as possible, ideally before conception, it is possible that 
prenatal health and outcomes could be better optimized.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, although considerable, rigorous research now demonstrates the potential 
deleterious effects of negative affective states and stress during pregnancy on birth 
outcomes, fetal and infant development, and family health, we do not yet have a clear grasp 
on the specific implications of these facts. Key issues for the next wave of research are as 
follows: disentangling the independent and comorbid effects of depressive symptoms, 
anxiety symptoms, pregnancy anxiety, and various forms of stress on maternal and infant 
outcomes; better understanding the concept of pregnancy anxiety and how to address it 
clinically; and further investigating effects of clinically significant affective disturbances on 
maternal and child outcomes, taking into account a mother's broad socio-environmental 
context. As our knowledge increases, it will be critical to identify the signs, symptoms, and 
diagnostic thresholds that warrant prenatal intervention and to develop efficient, effective, 
and ecologically valid screening and intervention strategies to be used widely. If risk factors 
can be identified prior to pregnancy and interventions designed for preconception, many 
believe this window of opportunity is our best bet [ 57]. Interdisciplinary research and 
collaboration will be crucial, however, to meeting these objectives and in order to reduce the 
burden of maternal stress, depression, and anxiety in the perinatal period.

Background: Client satisfaction is essential for further improvement of quality of focused antenatal care and to
provide uniform health care services for pregnant women. However, studies on level of client satisfaction with
focused antenatal care and associated factors are lacking. So, the purpose of this study is to assess satisfaction with
focused antenatal care service and associated factors among pregnant women attending focused antenatal care at
health centers in Jimma town.
Methods: A facility based cross-sectional study involving both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection
was used from Feb 1-30/2013. Three hundred eighty nine pregnant women those come to the health centers were
included in the study. A semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussion guide was employed to obtain the
necessary information for this study. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Logistic
regression model was used to compare level of satisfaction by predictors ’variables. Qualitative data was analyzed
based on thematic frameworks to support the quantitative results.
Result: More than half of the respondents (60.4%) were satisfied with the service that they received. As to specific
components, most of the respondents (80.7%) were satisfied with interpersonal aspects, and 62.2% were satisfied with
organization of health care aspect. Meanwhile, 49.9% of the respondents were not satisfied with technical quality
aspect and 67.1% were not satisfied with physical environment aspect. Multivariate logistic regression analysis result
showed that type of health center, educational status of mother, monthly income of the family, type of pregnancy and
history of stillbirth were the predictors of the level of satisfaction. The study found out that dissatisfaction was high in
mothers utilizing service at Jimma health center, in mothers with tertiary educational level, in mothers with average
monthly family income >1000birr, in mothers with unplanned pregnancy and in mothers with history of stillbirth.
Conclusions: Even though greater percentages of women (60.4%) were satisfied with the focused antenatal care
service, the level of satisfaction was lower compared to other studies. The investigator recommends that patient
feedback should be recognized as a legitimate method of evaluating health services in the health center as a whole.

Abstract
Background: Client satisfaction is essential for further improvement of quality of focused antenatal care and to
provide uniform health care services for pregnant women. However, studies on level of client satisfaction with
focused antenatal care and associated factors are lacking. So, the purpose of this study is to assess satisfaction with
focused antenatal care service and associated factors among pregnant women attending focused antenatal care at
health centers in Jimma town.
Methods: A facility based cross-sectional study involving both qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection
was used from Feb 1-30/2013. Three hundred eighty nine pregnant women those come to the health centers were
included in the study. A semi-structured questionnaire and focus group discussion guide was employed to obtain the
necessary information for this study. Quantitative data was analysed using SPSS for windows version 16.0. Logistic
regression model was used to compare level of satisfaction by predictors ’variables. Qualitative data was analyzed
based on thematic frameworks to support the quantitative results.
Result: More than half of the respondents (60.4%) were satisfied with the service that they received. As to specific
components, most of the respondents (80.7%) were satisfied with interpersonal aspects, and 62.2% were satisfied with
organization of health care aspect. Meanwhile, 49.9% of the respondents were not satisfied with technical quality
aspect and 67.1% were not satisfied with physical environment aspect. Multivariate logistic regression analysis result
showed that type of health center, educational status of mother, monthly income of the family, type of pregnancy and
history of stillbirth were the predictors of the level of satisfaction. The study found out that dissatisfaction was high in
mothers utilizing service at Jimma health center, in mothers with tertiary educational level, in mothers with average
monthly family income >1000birr, in mothers with unplanned pregnancy and in mothers with history of stillbirth.
Conclusions: Even though greater percentages of women (60.4%) were satisfied with the focused antenatal care
service, the level of satisfaction was lower compared to other studies. The investigator recommends that patient
feedback should be recognized as a legitimate method of evaluating health services in the health center as a whole.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/7/164Background
Even though between 1990 and 2010, maternal mortality
worldwide dropped by almost 50%, every day, approxi-mately 800 women die from preventable causes related
to pregnancy and childbirth and 99 per cent of all mater-
nal deaths occur in developing countries [1]. Sub-SaharanAfrica had the highest maternal mortality rate (MMR)
at 500 maternal deaths per 100 000 live births. Ethiopia
is one of the few countries that account for most of thematernal deaths; others include India, Nigeria, Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Pakistan, Sudan, and Indonesia
[2]. According to 2011 Ethiopian Demographic HealthSurvey(EDHS), the maternal mortality rate of Ethiopia
is 676/100,000 live births [3]. In Ethiopia, like in many
developing countries, the causes of maternal deaths aremainly attributed to the thr ee delays; that is delay in
seeking care, delay in reaching appropriate care and delay
in receiving care. Delay in receiving care can happen dueto inadequate skilled personnel in emergency obstetric
care, inadequate supplies and equipment and poor quality
of services [4].
The government of Ethiopia is committed to achieving
millennium development goals (MDG) 5, to improve ma-
ternal health, with a target of reducing the maternalm o r t a l i t yr a t e( M M R )b yt h r e e - q u a r t e r so v e rt h ep e r i o d
1990 to 2015. Accordingly, the Federal Ministry of Health
(FMoH) of Ethiopia has applied multi-pronged approachesto reducing maternal and newborn morbidity and mortal-
ity. Improving access to and strengthening facility-based
maternal and newborn services is one such approach, andis also a health sector development plan (HSDP) strategic
objective. The Antenatal Care is considered as one of a
focused strategy to reduce maternal mortality. Accordingto 2011 Ethiopian Demographic Health Survey (EDHS)
report, nationally thirty-four percent of pregnant mothers
who gave birth in the five years preceding the surveyreceived antenatal care from a skilled provider for their
most recent birth and regional (Oromia) prevalence is
31%. Few developing countries including Ethiopia havefully embraced and implemented the focused antenatal
care (FANC) model. Even in countries adopting it as
their antenatal care (ANC) programme, it is not fully
implemented due to lack of personnel and structural
changes [5-8].
One of the important problems which are continuously
faced these days is the lack of good quality antenatal care
and gaining client satisfaction, which are of importantresponsibilities of the high er authorities and staffs in
the health care system [9]. Evaluating to what extent
patients are satisfied with he alth services is clinically
relevant, as satisfied patients are more likely to comply
with treatment, take an active role in their own care, to
continue using medical care services and recommendcenter ‘s services to others [10]. A satisfied patient willrecommend center ‘s services expressing their satisfaction
to four or five peoples, while a dissatisfied patient on the
other hand will complain to twenty or more [11]. It is alsoessential to identify the factors involved in dissatisfaction
if a good health care system is sought [12].
Despite the fact that client satisfaction is essential for
further improvement of quality of focused antenatal care
and to provide uniform health care services for pregnant
women, little is known about the levels and associatedfactors of satisfaction in Ethiopia in general and no data
in the study area in particular. Therefore, this paper aims
to have certain contribution in closing this gap.
Results
A total of 389 pregnant women were enrolled in thestudy giving a completion rate of 100%; of which 142
(36.5%) from Mendera Kochi health center, 136(35%)
from Higher 2 health center and 111(28.5%) from Jimmahealth center.
Socio-demographic characteristics
The largest numbers of pregnant women belong to the
age range between 20 to 29 years 284(73%) followed
by age range 30 –39 years 73(18.8%) with mean age of
25 years. Three hundred seventy six (96.7%) of the women
were married and the rest were single. Regarding ethnic
and religious distribution of respondents, the predominantethnicities were Oromo 241(62%) followed by Guragae 48
(12.3%) while the dominant religion was Muslim 236
(60.7%) succeeded by orthodox 112(28.8%). With regardto occupation, two hundred sixty four (67.9%) of pregnant
women were housewives followed by merchants and
employees accounting for 46(11.8%) and 40(10.2%) re-spectively. One hundred forty six (37.5%) of the women
attended primary education (grade 1 –8) succeeded by
those who had no education 1 11(28.5%). The greatest
number of the respondents, 128(32.9%) had average
family monthly income below 500birr (Table 1).
Obstetric and reproductive health profile
Among the total studied clients, 283(72.8%) of themhave given birth for one to four children followed by
those who have never given birth and who gave birthfor five or more children accounting for 81(20.8%) and
25(6.4%) respectively. Among who have given birth 307
(78.9%), 34(11. 04%) of them end up with stillbirths.
Seventy one (18.3%) of the women had previous history
of abortions. From women who had previous history
of pregnancy, 185(60.2%) had at least one history ofantenatal care. The majority of the respondents ’320
(82.3%) agreed that their current pregnancy is planned
and wanted (Table 2).Chemir et al. BMC Research Notes 2014, 7:164 Page 2 of 8

women about importance of fanc
From the total study clients, 28 9(74.3%) of them responded
that their current health condition is ‘good ’,w h i l et h er e s t
100(25.7%) is ‘poor ’. Two hundred ninety four (75.6%) of
the clients had ‘good knowledge ’regarding importance and
objectives of focused antenatal care.
Women ’s satisfaction with fanc services
In overall, 235(60.4%) of the women were satisfied and
the rest 39.4% were dissatisfied with the focused antenatal
care (FANC) services (Figure 1). Based on componentwise level of satisfaction, greater proportion of satisfaction
was recorded on interpersonal skill aspect followed byorganization of health care aspect which accounts for
314(80.7%) and 242(62.2%) respectively (Figure 1). The
finding was supported by qualitative results as: majorityof the discussant from the three HCs share the idea
that ……..they were very happy that the service providers
have much respect for them and they are eager to helpthem. One of the discussant from mendera kochi HC also
said that “…… ..I was happy because they tried to ask me
what I feel and they had given me information relatedto pregnancy ”.Greater proportion of dissatisfaction was
recorded on physical environment part followed by dis-
satisfaction with technical quality which accounts for261(67.1%) and 194(49.9%) respectively (Figure 1). The
findings on areas of dissatisfaction was supported by
qualitative findings as: many of the discussants forwardedthat: ……..they are not happy and not sure on the appro-
priateness of physical examinations done on them because
they do have questions on the technical quality of students
since in the majority of cases the service was rendered
by students (Jimma HC and Higher two HC). One of the
discussant from Higher 2 HC said that “…… .I was not
happy on the examinations they had performed; they
didn ’t take even a minute to carry out and they look lack-
ing confident ”.
Perceived causes of dissatisfaction and client suggestions
to make fanc services more satisfying to pregnant women
In this study, clients were asked for any comments and
suggestions regarding the FAN C service they have received.

improve ventilation system of the office and waiting space
82(21.1%) (Table 3).Factors associated with satisfaction
Both bivariate and multivariate binary logistic regression
analysis were made to identify predictors of satisfaction.
The bivariate analysis result revealed that health centertype, socio-demographic variables such as ethnicity, occu-
pation, educational status, religion, and family monthly
income of the mother, obstetric profile variables suchas parity, type of pregnancy, focused antenatal care
(ANC) history, and number of visit and client knowledge
about importance of focused antenatal care (FANC) weresignificantly associated with satisfaction with focused
antenatal care services. The above mentioned significant
variables and those with p-value less than 0.25 in thecrude analysis (marital status and history of stillbirth) were
again entered in to multivariate logistic model to control
for confounding. The only variables with p-value >0.25 incrude analysis and also excluded from multivariate logistic
analysis were age, abortion history and health condition.
The variables with p-value less than 0.05 in multivariateanalysis were taken as significant predictors of satisfaction
and the rest were refuted. Variables which significantly
predict level of satisfaction with focused antenatal care
services include: type of health center, socio-demographic
variables: average monthly income of family and educa-tional status of the mother, and obstetric profile variables:
type of pregnancy and history of stillbirth. It was observed
that pregnant women who were satisfied with FANCservices were likely to be: those who utilize service in
Mendera Kochi (AOR = 4.93, 95% CI: 1.82, 9.74) and
Higher Two HCs (AOR = 4.91, 95% CI: 1.44, 16.73), thosewho have no formal education (AOR = 32.63, 95% CI:

Discussion
According to this study it was found out that overall
satisfaction with focused antenatal care service in thestudy population was 60.4%. This is somewhat similar
with findings of a study conducted in Malaysia (56.7%)
but lower than other studies conducted in Addis Ababa,Ethiopia (89.2%), Sweden (82%) and Thailand (71.8%)
[13,20-22]. The difference could be due to subjective
nature of the subject matter; because measure of satis-faction needs standardized scales and tools for accurate
measurement but most of the literatures measure satis-
faction with simple yes/no response category. And alsocould be attributed to study period difference due to
the increase in expectation of patients to the service
they are going to receive with rapid advancement intechnology and peoples thinking and lifestyle and also
the study is conducted in urban setting only. Even if
greater percentage of overall satisfaction was reportedin different literatures, there is a difference in satisfaction
level in different aspects of focused antenatal care services.
The results of this study indicated that more than threefourth (80.7%) and over half (62.2%) of pregnant women
were satisfied with interpersonal and organization of
health care aspects of focused antenatal care servicesrespectively. However, half (49.9%) and 67.1% of pregnant
women were dissatisfied with technical quality and physical
environment aspects of focused antenatal care servicesrespectively. The finding shares some inconsistencies in
terms of higher level of satisfaction with technical quality
aspect and lower level of satisfaction with organizationof health care aspect with other studies conducted in
Malaysia and Thailand [13,21]. The reason for the incon-
sistencies might be attributed to difference in culturalsetting in providers and receivers and due to differences
in set up in which the studies are conducted at hospital
antenatal units.
The perceived cause of dissatisfaction forwarded by the
majority were long waiting time (32.6%), overcrowding in
the clinic during morning time (26%) and poor laboratoryservices (25.2%). Possible suggestions raised by most of
the clients include minimize waiting time (32.9%), prepare
appropriate waiting room (24.7%), and improve ventilationsystem of the office and waiting space (21.1%). This
finding was supported by other studies conducted in
Bangladesh and Oman [23,24].
This study found that pregnant women who were util-
izing service at Higher 2 HC (80.1%) were more satisfied
than Mendera kochi health center (67.6%) and JimmaHC (27%). The lower satisfaction level of pregnant women
attending focused antenatal care at Jimma health center
might be associated with high client flow per day ascompared to other HCs and preferable by majority of
the people residing on the center of the town due to its
favorability in terms of geographic location. While theother health centers more suitable for mothers from
rural settings. It was also observed that pregnant women
with low level of education were more likely to be satisfiedwith FANC services than those who had higher level of
education. The possible reason why women with higher
level of education were dissatisfied was because womenwith a higher level of education are probably more vocal
and information-seeking and know what to expect. This
finding agrees with findings of a study in Malaysia [13,20].However, it disagrees with a study done in Sweden in
which patients with a low level of education were less
likely to be satisfied than women with a high level of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/7/164education. The reason forwarded for lower level of satis-
faction among mothers with low educational level was
because there could be a discrepancy in communicationbetween women with a low level of education and the
service providers; it is known that communication is
facilitated by similar social and educational background.The likelihood of satisfaction by antenatal care service was
lesser among women whose monthly income was 1000
birr or more or the higher monthly income the lowerthe satisfaction and vice versa which agreed with study
conducted at Addis Ababa Ethiopia. The poor economic
condition and living below the poverty line with lowmonthly income of respondents could have made them
unable to deal with modern medical services or exposure
to other kind of facilities. This made patients satisfied withany services that they were provided [22]. The chance of
satisfaction on the focused antenatal care service rendered
was lower to a statistically significant level among womenwho had unplanned pregnancy and history of stillbirth
which agrees with findings of a study conducted at Addis
Ababa Ethiopia by Workneh. Women who had unplannedpregnancy may be too sensitive in terms of privacy and
confidentiality due to possible stigma if the pregnancy is
out of the wedlock. And also women who had unplannedpregnancy experience greater relationship instability than
women whose pregnancies were intended. Lack of faith
on the service they were receiving and associating causeof stillbirth with constraints from the service they received
in their past pregnancy focused antenatal care follow
up may be a reason for decreased likelihood of satisfac-tion among pregnant women with previous history of
stillbirths [22,25].
Strength and limitations
The study employed standardized five point likert scale
and reliable tools for measurement of satisfaction. Thestudy also involved both quantitative and qualitative
methods of data collections to maximize the reliability
of the data collected.
Social desirability bias could have affected the quality of
data collected because study subjects might get difficulty
to answer dissatisfaction in the presence of an interviewer.However, interview was conducted in a separate room by
non-staff members to minimize the bias.
Conclusions
Even though greater percentages of women (60.4%) were
satisfied with the focused antenatal care service, the levelof satisfaction was lower compared to other studies. Also
the clients were dissatisfied with physical environments
of the health center and technical quality of the providers.Since, patient satisfaction is an increasingly important
issue both in evaluation and shaping of health care, it
should be carried out routinely in all aspects of health careto improve the quality of health services. Long waiting
time, overcrowding in the clinic during morning time, and
poor laboratory services were some of the constraintsperceived by majority of pregnant women as a cause of
dissatisfaction. Health center admistrators should increase
the staff strength to cope with the client load, to increasethe consultation time and decrease overcrowding. The
waiting time in reception area before getting focused
antenatal service should be decreased by better use ofresources and by increasing man power.
Methods
Study area and period
The study was conducted at Jimma town health centersfrom February 1-30/2013. Jimma town is located 357 kms
South West of Addis Ababa with a total projected
population of 151,010. The town has 3 health centers.Total estimated number of pregnant women in each
health center encompasses 1610 for Jimma Health
Center, 1960 for Higher 2 Health center and 2044 forMendera Kochi Health center respectively. Average
number of client flow per day is 9 for Higher 2 Health
center, 12 for Jimma Health center and 6 for MenderaKochi Health center.
Study design
A facility based cross-sectional study design with both
quantitative and qualitative methods of data collection
was employed.
Source and study population
All pregnant women utilizing focused antenatal care(FANC) services in the healt h centers were the source
populations. And pregnant women utilizing focused
antenatal care service in the health centers during datacollection period were considered as study population.
Sampling procedure
The sample size for quantitative study was determined
by the single population proportion formula by consider-
ing 56.7% proportion of satisfaction of a study done inMalaysia [13] with a marginal error of 5% between the
sample and the population at 95% confidence level,
which were 389. Pregnant women who were registeredfor antenatal care during data collection period were
taken until the required sample size was fulfilled after
proportionally allocating the sample population to eachhealth centers. For qualitative study six FGDs; two in
each health center was conducted. A total of 48 pregnant
women with 7 –10 pregnant women in each FGD were
participated. A convenience sampling technique was used
to select pregnant women for the FGD by taking health
centre as homogeneity criteria.Chemir et al. BMC Research Notes 2014, 7:164 Page 6 of 8
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/7/164Measurement
The data were collected using pre tested semi-structured
questionnaires and measurement scales that were adaptedfrom the review of literatures [13-17]. The questionnaire
contains 49 items which were re lated to socio-demographic
characteristics, obstetric profile; current health condi-tion and knowledge of pregnant women on purpose and
objectives of focused antenatal care (FANC) and measure
of satisfaction. The outcom e variable satisfaction was
assessed using a 5-point Likert scales ranging from dissat-
isfied to fully satisfied (1 to 5 points) with a 27 items. The
satisfaction scale had the internal consistency or reliabilityscore ranging from 0.73 to 0.95(Table 5).
Focus group interview guideline was used to guide and
probe the focus group discussion. The focus group inter-view guideline includes probing questions on areas of
care clients satisfied, areas of care clients not satisfied
and client suggestions regarding how to make servicesmore satisfactory.
Pretesting of the questionnaire was conducted among
5% of pregnant women other than the study populationin Serbo health center focused antenatal care (FANC) unit
prior to actual data collection to assess the face validity of
the questionnaire.
Data collection
A total of 3 data collectors and 3 supervisors were re-cruited for data collection procedure. The data collectors
and supervisors were non-staff members and female
in gender to make clients feel more confidential andanonymous. The questionnaires were filled by direct
face to face semi-structure d interview. Clients were
interviewed at exit. The clients were interviewed outsidethe service room far away from employees and the data
collectors were non-staff personnel ’s to assure confidence
and anonymity. The data collectors and supervisors weretrained a week ahead of the actual data collection period
on data collection process to standardize interviews and
reduce interviewer biases. For qualitative study; clientswere asked to express their satisfaction following the FGD
guideline. All discussions were tape recorded & field notes
were taken and transcribed to texts immediately. Eachdiscussion took one to two hours.Data analysis
Following the data collection, data were coded, and en-tered to a computer using Epidata version 3.1 and thenexported to SPSS version 16.0 for analysis. Descriptive
statistics and binary logistic regressions analysis were
performed. In the binary logistic regression, both binaryand multivariate analyses were carried out. All the variables
were entered in to bivariate analysis and those explanatory
variables with a p value < 0.25 in crude analysis was consid-ered as a candidate for multivariate analysis and those
variables with a p value < 0.05 in multivariate analysis was
considered as significant predictor of satisfaction. Finally,the result of the analysis was presented in texts, tables
and graphs as appropriate. For qualitative study, first
individual, pre-labeled tapes were transcribed and thentranslation and back translation of the transcription was
performed. The discussion was conducted in Amharic and
Oromiffa so that it was translated to English and backtranslated to Amharic and Oromiffa. Next completed
transcription was compared with hand written notes to
fill inaudible phases or gaps in tapes. The data werecolor-coded and grouped based on thematic frame-
works (three thematic areas). Concepts were extracted
from themes and presented in narratives & used tosupport the quantitative results.
Operational definitions
Cut off point for client satisfaction: −Since each item
had 5 point Likert Scale which ranges between 1 and 5;
the scores for each domain was calculated by summingthe answers to all items in each domain. Clients ’overall
and component wise level of satisfaction was classified
into two categories satisfied and dissatisfied by using cutof point calculated using the demarcation threshold for-
mula: {(total highest score-total lowest score)/2} + Total
lowest score [13,18].
Knowledge
One point was given for the correct answers and zerofor the incorrect answers. The knowledge scores were
divided to two levels which are good knowledge and
poor knowledge using the mean knowledge score as thecutoff point [15,19].

Purpose— Although first-trimester vaginal bleeding is an alarming symptom, few studies have
investigated the prevalence and predictors of early bleeding. This study characterizes first trimester
bleeding, setting aside bleeding that occurs at time of miscarriage.
Methods— Participants (n=4539) were women ages 18–45 enrolled in Right From the Start , a
community-based pregnancy study (2000–2008). Bleeding information included timing, heaviness,
duration, color, and associated pain, as well as recurrence risk in subsequent pregnancies. Life table
analyses were used to describe gestational timing of bleeding. Factors associated with bleeding were
investigated using multiple logistic regression, with multiple imputation for missing data.
Results— Approximately one-fourth of participants (n=1207) reported bleeding (n=1656 episodes),
but only 8% of women with bleeding reported heavy bleeding. Of the spotting and light bleeding
episodes (n=1555), 28% were associated with pain. Among heavy episodes (n=100), 54% were
associated with pain. Most episodes lasted less than 3 days, and most occurred between gestational
weeks 5–8. Twelve percent of women with bleeding and 13% of those without experienced
miscarriage. Maternal characteristics associated with bleeding included fibroids and prior
miscarriage.
Conclusions— Consistent with the hypothesis that bleeding is a marker for placental dysfunction,
bleeding is most likely to be seen around the time of the luteal-placental shift.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptbleeding prevalence in early pregnancy are imprecise and range from 7 to 24% (5–9). This
wide range in estimates is likely due to differences in study design.
Only three reports have attempted to systematically describe early pregnancy bleeding patterns
(5,8,10). These studies are limited by small sample (10), observation through only the eighth
week of gestation (10), and recruitment and data collection late during pregnancy (5,8). The
latter two studies do not provide detailed information on first-trimester bleeding and exclude
miscarriages (5,8). Only one of these investigated maternal predictors of vaginal bleeding
(5). This study found that women who were older, with passive smoking exposure, prior
preterm birth, multiple prior elective terminations or with prior miscarriages were more likely
to experience “intense” vaginal bleeding, measured by heaviness, duration, and an index of
total blood loss.
We used data from Right From the Start , a community-based early pregnancy cohort, to
characterize the patterns and predictors of early pregnancy bleeding, setting aside bleeding
episodes that occur at the time of miscarriage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Population
Right From the Start  (RFTS) is an ongoing cohort that began enrollment of pregnant women
in 2000. Over time, the study has included three phases (RFTS 1, 2, and 3) and has been active
in Galveston, Texas, Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, and the Triangle region (including
Raleigh, Durham, and Chapel Hill), North Carolina. Participants were at least 18 years old,
spoke English or Spanish, had not used assisted reproductive technologies to conceive, and
intended to carry the pregnancy to term. Women who were not yet pregnant but attempting to
conceive could pre-enroll prior to pregnancy and were considered enrolled once they reported
a positive pregnancy test. Pre-enrolled women must have been attempting pregnancy for fewer
than six months (RFTS 1 and 2) or fewer than three months (RFTS 3) to be eligible. Women
entered the study prior to twelve completed weeks of gestation (RFTS 1), prior to nine
completed weeks of gestation (RFTS 2), or only pre-enrolled (RFTS 3). Formal enrollment
occurred, on average, at 53 days of gestation for women who enrolled while pregnant (n=3581),
and at 38 days of gestation for women who pre-enrolled in the study (n=958). Informed consent
was obtained from each study subject in compliance with Institutional Review Boards.
Participants had an early pregnancy ultrasound to assess fetal viability and gestational age of
the fetus. Gestational age was calculated using self-reported last menstrual period (LMP). If
this was unavailable, ultrasound-based gestational age was used (n=15). Seventy-five percent
of ultrasounds were completed by the end of the ninth week of gestation.
Telephone interviews were conducted to collect detailed information about the first trimester,
including information about bleeding symptoms. All women, regardless of pregnancy
outcome, provided this detailed information. In the first phase of the study (RFTS 1), two
interviews were conducted: one shortly after enrollment during the first trimester, followed by
a second interview around 20 weeks of pregnancy. Data from both of these interviews were
compiled to reflect all first trimester information. Later phases of RFTS (RFTS 2, RFTS 3)
collected detailed first trimester data in an interview at the end of the first trimester, no later
than the 16th week of pregnancy. Average time of completion of this interview was during the
fourteenth week of pregnancy. When miscarriage occurred before a scheduled interview, the
interview was conducted as soon as possible after pregnancy loss.
Outcomes were self-reported, and prenatal records were obtained to verify the outcome. Live
birth verification was obtained through linkage to state vital records. Miscarriage was definedHasan et al. Page 2
Ann Epidemiol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 July 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptas loss of a recognized pregnancy prior to twenty completed weeks. The date of a miscarriage
was self-reported as the date of dilatation and evacuation or as the date of most severe bleeding.
Women who had their last menstrual period before July 14, 2008 were included. Exclusions
from the sample include: women who did not complete the first trimester interview (n=170),
women missing both LMP and ultrasound-based gestational age (n=2), women missing
enrollment dates (n=1), women whose miscarriage occurred on same day as the enrollment
day (n=4), and women with ectopic pregnancies (n=6). Women could enroll during more than
one pregnancy, but only the first enrollment was included (n=238 subsequent pregnancies
excluded). A total of 4539 pregnancies contributed to the analysis.
Variable definitions
Bleeding information— Participants reported the total number of bleeding episodes
experienced during the first trimester and detailed information about the timing, heaviness,
color, duration, and pain associated with the first three episodes (see Appendix). If bleeding
stopped for at least two days and then started again, this was considered two separate episodes
of bleeding. Duration was reported in days. Heaviness was defined according to the heaviest
bleeding in an episode, and was compared to heaviness of usual menses. A ‘spotting’ episode
was only noticed when wiping, a ‘light bleeding’ episode was defined as having the heaviest
day(s) of flow being lighter than the heavy flow of a usual menstrual period, and a heavy
bleeding episode was defined as having the heaviest day(s) of flow as heavy or heavier than
the heavy flow of a usual menstrual period. Participants could describe the color of each episode
as ‘pink,’ ‘red,’ or ‘brown.’ If participants reported bleeding-associated pain, they were asked
to characterize the pain as mild, moderate, or severe.
This analysis focused on bleeding episodes that occur during the first trimester, regardless of
whether a miscarriage occurs. To exclude bleeding that occurred at the time of miscarriage,
we did not include any bleeding episodes that ended within 4 days of a miscarriage. This
cutpoint was varied in later sensitivity analyses, and the choice of cutpoint was not found to
affect results.
Other characteristics— Data collected at the first trimester interview included demographic
factors (age, race/ethnicity, education, marital status, percent of poverty level [according to the
2008 poverty guidelines, accounting for number of persons in household]), pre-pregnancy body
mass index, usual menstrual cycle length in days, maternal morbidities (reproductive tract
infections during pregnancy and diabetes), maternal behaviors (active and passive smoking,
prenatal vitamin use, alcohol intake, caffeine intake), and prior obstetric history (parity,
gravidity, history of miscarriage, induced abortion, or preterm birth). The early pregnancy
ultrasound included systematic screening for uterine fibroids ( ≥ 0.5 cm diameter) (11).
Women were classified according to whether or not they were treated for one or more of the
following infections at any time from LMP to the end of the first trimester: yeast infection,
urinary tract infection, bacterial vaginosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, chlamydia,
trichomonas, gonorrhea, syphilis, genital warts, or outbreaks of genital herpes. Women with
pre-existing diabetes or who had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy were classified
as having diabetes. Women who smoked cigarettes during pregnancy were identified as
smokers. Passive smoking was defined according to whether an individual in the participant’s
household was a regular smoker. Women who reported drinking any alcoholic beverages
during the pregnancy were classified as being exposed to alcohol.
Data Analysis
All analyses were conducted in Stata, version 9.2 (College Station, Texas).Hasan et al. Page 3
Ann Epidemiol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 July 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptDescriptive analyses— Episodes were categorized into completed weeks of pregnancy
based on the day in which an episode began. We used life table analyses to calculate the
proportion of women with bleeding for each week of gestation during the first trimester. The
same was repeated for women with heavy bleeding only. Participants were censored at time
of miscarriage (n=464), induced abortion (n=14), or interview when it occurred before the end
of the first trimester (n=114). Miscarriage and induced abortion dates were based on participant
self-report. The distribution of episodes by heaviness, duration, color, and associated pain were
examined descriptively for all bleeding episodes.
Exploratory modeling— Maternal characteristics predicting the presence/absence of
bleeding were evaluated using exploratory logistic models. All covariates were included in
initial models and the least important (highest P-value) was sequentially removed if the P-
value from the likelihood ratio test was greater than 0.15. The final reduced model included
those variables with an associated P-value less than 0.15. The purpose of these analyses was
to identify potential associations between maternal characteristics and bleeding, not to
determine risk factors based on statistical significance alone; thus, a relaxed P-value cutoff
was used in order to identify all maternal characteristics potentially associated with bleeding.
Predictors of the heaviness of bleeding (based on each woman’s heaviest episode) were
evaluated using a generalized multinomial logistic model, with a reference group of “no
bleeding” and index categories of “spotting,” “light bleeding,” and “heavy bleeding.” We
followed the same strategy previously described to identify variables predicting the heaviness
of bleeding, while requiring the previously identified predictors of any bleeding to remain in
the model. For the multinomial logistic model, likelihood ratio tests were conducted to
determine whether categories of heaviness could be combined. If heaviness levels were not
different from each other at an a priori P -value of 0.15, the categories were combined.
Multiple imputation procedures (Stata, Imputation with Chained Equations ( 12)) were used so
that participants with missing covariate data could be included. This method imputes missing
values of a variable from a posterior distribution based on a regression of the non-missing
values of the variable on all other predictors in the model. Five imputation cycles were used.
Most variables were missing for less than 3% of the sample, but poverty level, fibroid status,
and cycle length were missing for 4.0%, 6.9% and 16.9% of the sample, respectively.
RESULTS
Most of the 4,539 women in this study were 25–34 years and self-identified as white, black,
or Hispanic (Table 1). Participants were generally of high educational attainment. About half
were nulliparous. Pregnancy ended in miscarriage for 12% of women and about two-thirds
them reported some bleeding during pregnancy. After excluding bleeding episodes that ended
within 4 days of miscarriage, 25% of women with miscarriage reported at least one episode of
bleeding during the first trimester, similar to the proportion of women without miscarriage who
reported bleeding during pregnancy (27%). However, heavy bleeding was more common in
pregnancies that miscarried ( 13). Of those reporting bleeding, 71% reported only one episode
(n=856); 20% reported two episodes (n=241); and 9%, three or more (n=110).
Our bleeding data began at gestational week 4, and bleeding episodes occurred during all
subsequent weeks of the first trimester, peaking around the sixth and seventh week of
pregnancy (Figure 1). Heavy episodes showed a similar pattern, and the peak extended
throughout a longer period of the first trimester.
Most episodes were characterized as ‘spotting only’ (75.6%), and the majority were painless
(70.7%) (Table 2). Heavy episodes comprised fewer than 10% of reported episodes. Half ofHasan et al. Page 4
Ann Epidemiol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 July 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptall episodes persisted for only one day, 30% were of two or three days duration, and
approximately 20% of episodes continued for more than 3 days. Heavy episodes were more
likely to be painful, of longer duration, and red in color (Table 2).
Of the women who reported bleeding, about 15% (n=151) reported an episode that occurred
around the time of their expected menstrual period, but only 2% (n=3) of these were heavy
episodes lasting more than 3 days. Women who reported more than one episode (n=351) had
variable intervals between episodes. About half of all multiple episodes occurred less than
fourteen days apart. Fewer than 3% of women (n=10) with multiple episodes reported episode
intervals consistent with the timing and length of their usual menstrual cycles, and none of
these had heaviness similar to usual menses.
Table 3 shows the factors predictive of bleeding. Maternal age (particularly between 28 and
34 years), more years of education, long ( ≥34 days) and short (<27 days) cycle length, fibroids,
infection, pre-existing or prior gestational diabetes, nulliparity, history of prior miscarriage,
and history of induced abortion were predictors of bleeding. The strongest predictor based on
strength of association was history of miscarriage. Body mass index, race/ethnicity, marital
status, percent poverty level, active or passive smoking, prenatal vitamin use, alcohol intake,
caffeine intake, gravidity, and prior preterm birth, were not predictors.
When assessing heaviness of bleeding, likelihood ratio tests indicated that the categories of
spotting and light bleeding could be constrained to have the same coefficients (X2 =14.7, df=12,
p=0.26), whereas the coefficients for the light and heavy bleeding categories were substantially
different and could not be constrained to be the same (X2=25.5, df=12, p=0.01). Because of
this, the spotting and light bleeding categories were combined for the multinomial analysis.
Table 4 shows the potentially important predictors of bleeding heaviness: maternal age, long/
short menstrual cycle length, fibroids, infection, pre-existing or prior gestational diabetes,
smoking, alcohol intake, nulliparity, and history of miscarriage and induced abortion. Estimates
for some categories are highly imprecise due to the small number of observations within some
strata of heavy bleeding. Most factors showed a stronger relationship with heavy bleeding
compared with light bleeding, but education, parity, and induced abortion history appeared to
be associated primarily with light bleeding. Of note, active smoking in pregnancy tended to be
inversely associated with spotting/light bleeding (Odds ratio (OR) 0.84, 95% confidence
interval (CI): 0.66, 1.05) but positively associated with heavy bleeding (OR 1.42, 95% CI:
0.81, 2.47). No dose-response was seen for number of cigarettes (data not shown). Alcohol
exposure was predictive of heavy bleeding only (OR 1.60, 95% CI: 1.03, 2.48). Smoking and
alcohol variables were not important predictors of ‘any’ bleeding.
We re-analyzed subsets of the data to evaluate potential biases. Our descriptive characterization
of the timing of bleeding in the first trimester was robust to restrictions in the study population
based on when women enrolled. When considering predictors of bleeding, we compared the
results of the model with multiple imputation to the model with no missing data for any
covariates, the results did not change substantially, though confidence intervals around
estimates were wider for the model without missing data, as expected given the reduced sample
size. We restricted to participants in their first pregnancy (n=1,527) and also to women whose
pregnancies progressed beyond the first trimester (n=3,960) and found no substantial changes
in model estimates.
DISCUSSION
We provide new evidence that first trimester bleeding episodes tend to peak during the sixth
and seventh weeks. Different characteristics of bleeding tend to cluster together. Heavy
bleeding episodes (similar or heavier than those of a woman’s normal menses) are more likelyHasan et al. Page 5
Ann Epidemiol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 July 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptto be associated with pain, longer duration, bright red color, and presence of multiple episodes,
while spotting episodes are more likely to occur in isolation and be of shorter duration and
without pain. This suggests that heavy bleeding may arise from different underlying biologic
events than spotting.
Though the causes of bleeding in later pregnancy have been investigated (due to placenta
previa, abruption, or infection), there has been little investigation of first trimester bleeding
(9,14,15). It is interesting that the peak in bleeding episodes coincides with the development
of a hormonally functional placenta. In very early pregnancy, the corpus luteum produces
progesterone. The shift from luteal production to placental production of progesterone occurs
by the seventh week of pregnancy and can result in a temporary reduction in progesterone
levels if the placenta is not producing sufficiently ( 16). Decreasing levels of progesterone are
associated with the onset of menses outside of pregnancy; similarly, during pregnancy,
decreasing levels may trigger an episode of vaginal bleeding and limit successful maintenance
of the pregnancy. Thus, bleeding at this time in pregnancy may signal that the early placenta
has not developed optimally.
A first-trimester bleeding episode may also occur due to premature onset of maternal-fetal
circulation or abnormal formation of placental membranes (17). In early pregnancy, the
maternal spiral arteries are blocked by a trophoblastic shell, maintaining a low oxygen
environment for fetal development until the ninth or tenth week of gestation when maternal-
fetal circulation begins (17). Premature onset of maternal-fetal circulation may be associated
with first trimester bleeding episodes (17,18). Such bleeding episodes may serve as a marker
of an improperly developing placenta. Placental dysfunction has been suggested to play a causal
role in adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage and pre-eclampsia (18).
Our results show that early pregnancy bleeding rarely mimics the bleeding of menses.
Gestational age misdating has been previously attributed to early pregnancy bleeding;(19)
however, the majority of women in our study reported bleeding that was light, of short duration,
and rarely resembled the heaviness of a usual menstrual cycle. Gestational age dating was
verified by ultrasound, and a validation substudy of ongoing pregnancies in RFTS 1 found that
the average difference between gestational age based on self-reported LMP and ultrasound was
less than one day (20). Based on these results, it is unlikely that many women misdate their
pregnancy by mistaking early pregnancy bleeding for their LMP, consistent with the results of
a previous study (10). We found little evidence that cyclic, menstrual-like bleeding occurs
during the first trimester. Few women reported intervals between episodes consistent with
menstrual cycling, and none of these reported heaviness similar to their menses.
In our exploratory analyses, several maternal characteristics emerged as important predictors
of the presence of bleeding, outlined in Tables 3 and 4. Of note, education, nulliparity, and
previous induced abortion may be important as measures of reporting sensitivity because they
were associated with increased reporting of spotting or light bleeding but not heavy bleeding.
Maternal behaviors, such as active smoking and alcohol intake during pregnancy, were
associated with heavy, but not light, bleeding. Smoking was also inversely associated with
light bleeding, likely related to decreased reporting of spotting and light bleeding episodes
among smokers. Overall, our results were consistent with previous reports and also provide
new information about maternal characteristics that may be associated with bleeding.
We acknowledge important limitations. Our results are based on women’s recall of their
bleeding during the early months of pregnancy, although a separate analysis found that a
subgroup who volunteered to prospectively record bleeding information throughout early
pregnancy showed high reporting accuracy at interview (21). However, even in this group
expected to represent a best-case scenario, recall accuracy was not perfect. Our study is alsoHasan et al. Page 6
Ann Epidemiol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2011 July 1.
NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscriptlimited by small sample size for low-prevalence predictors, such as diabetes. The decreased
precision of these estimates was particularly evident in the analysis of predictors of bleeding
heaviness.
Despite the limitations, our study provides important new information about bleeding in early
pregnancy, including data on the timing, heaviness, duration, color, and overall number of
episodes. The generalizability of our findings is strengthened by the community recruitment
that did not exclude participants whose pregnancies terminated prior to twenty weeks of
gestation. In addition, timing of gestational age was verified with ultrasound, which increases
the confidence in our findings regarding the gestational timing of bleeding. The ultrasound
also provided unique information about uterine fibroids not available to other perinatal
researchers. Further research is needed to systematically study bleeding in mid to late
pregnancy with the same detail.
In conclusion, spotting or light bleeding episodes are common symptoms in early pregnancy.
Heavy bleeding is much less common. Whether both light and heavy bleeding arise from the
same mechanisms or have different etiologies is an important question for future research.
Future steps include investigating the relationship between bleeding episodes, early pregnancy
biology, placental pathophysiology, and pregnancy outcomes.

Questions about bleeding in first trimester interview
H8a. Since you got pregnant, have you had any bleeding or spotting with blood?
H8b. Did the bleeding or spotting start at the time you expected your menstrual period?
H9a. As best as you can remember when did you start to bleed or spot for the first/2nd/3rd time?
M/d/y
H9b. (if H9a ‘don’t know’) Do you remember what week that was (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc)
H10a . Compare this spotting/bleeding to amount of bleeding you usually have: on the day of
your heaviest spotting or bleeding in the 1st/2nd/3rd episode, would you describe the bleeding
as light, lighter than heavy flow, like heavy flow, more than heavy flowHasan et al. Page 8

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author ManuscriptH10b . What color was the blood, was it generally red, pink, or brown?
H10c . How many days did it last? If it stopped for at least 2 days and started again, consider
this a separate episode.
H11a . Did you have any pain during the time you had spotting or bleeding?
H11b . Overall, would you describe the pain as mild, moderate, or severe?
H12. Did you have a 2nd/3rd time when you had spotting or bleeding? (start back at H9a)Hasan et al. Page 9

Category B: Animal studies do not demonstrate foetal risk but no 
controlled study in humans.  Category C: No controlled study in humans available, animals' study reveal ed adverse foetal effects.  
 
For acute pyelonephritis in pregnancy, hospitalisation is 
often indicated even though it is not mandatory. It is easier to monitor for complications if the mother is treated as an in-patient. Indications for admissions include severe 
distress, dehydration, poor oral food tolerance, maternal 
and foetal complications and where intravenous antibiotic is necessary. Urine culture and sensitivity is mandatory in 
the management of acute pyelonephritis, and this should 
be obtained before starting antibiotics. Empirical treatment 
with parenteral antibiotics should begin as soon as possible. 
The clinical condition must be closely monitored for any 
complications. Antibiotic of choice is based on common 
aetiology and resistance pattern in the community. When 
results of the culture and sensitivity are available, the treatment regime can be altered accordingly. E. coli is the 
major causative agent in acute pyelonephritis. With good 
hydration and antibiotic treatment, most patients respond 
within 24-48 hours. If patient's symptoms persist despite appropriate antibiotics, further investigations are needed to evaluate the possibility of underlying predisposing factors such as renal calculi and renal tract abnormalities or a 
perinephric abscess formation. The latter needs surgical 
drainage. Septicaemia is present in about 15% of patient with acute pyelonephritis. Blood culture and sensitivity should be obtained if the patient does not respond to 
antibiotic treatment.
3  Intravenous antibiotic therapy should 
be continued for a further 24-48 hours after initial  response,  
evidenced by subsiding fever, disappearance of lumbar pain and improvement in patient's general physical 
appearance. Oral antibiotics are preferably continued for 
further 1-2 weeks.
3 
 
Group B streptococcal (GBS) vaginal colonisation is proven 
to be associated with pre-term premature rupture of 
membranes, neonatal sepsis and congenital pneumonia. This organism also contributes to 5% of UTI. Studies have shown that pregnant mothers who received penicillin 
treatment for GBS bacteriuria have significantly lower incidence of pre-term deliver y and premature rupture of 
membranes. It therefore make sense that mothers with 
GBS bacteriuria should be treated with antibiotics. 
 
UTI recur in 4-5% of pregnancies especially when the initial infection is inadequately treated. Pregnant mothers with urinary tract calculi, diabetes mellitus and a past history of 
UTI are more prone to recurrence. Prophylactic antibiotics 
with cephalexin and nitrofurantoin are effective treatment. Further evaluation of urinary tract abnormalities with radiological imaging is recommended at 3 months 
postpartum after anatomical and physiological changes of 
pregnancy have resolved.
3 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
UTI in pregnancy is associated with significant morbidity for both mother and baby. All pregnant mothers should be screened for UTI. Untreated UTI will lead to pre-term premature rupture of membrane,  maternal chorioamnionitis, 
intrauterine growth retardation and low birth weight baby.  Early treatment with antibiotics has significantly reduced the above complications. Urine culture and sensitivity remain the gold standard in diagnosing UTI. If patients' 
condition are not improving despite adequate and 
appropriate use of antimicrobials, further investigations for underlying predisposing factors are necessary. Prophylactic antibiotic is indicated for recurrent UTI.

Based on an analysis of 17 trials (8084 pa rticipants), this meta-analysis found that 
lifestyle intervention reduced diabetes by 49%. This compare favourably with anti-
diabetic drugs (risk reduction 30%) but so mewhat less than orlistat (risk reduction

Background: Low birth weight has important short- and long-term health implications. Previously it has been
shown that pregnancies affected by hyperemesis gravidarum in the mother are at higher risk of having low birth
weight offspring. In this study we tested whether such risks are also evident with less severe nausea and vomiting
in pregnancy.
Methods: One thousand two hundred thirty-eight women in the prospective Cambridge Baby Growth Study filled
in pregnancy questionnaires which included questions relating to adverse effects of pregnancy and drugs taken
during that time. Ordinal logistic regression models, adjusted for parity, ethnicity, marital and smoking status were
used to relate the risk of giving birth to low birth weight (< 2.5 kg) babies to nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy
that were not treated with anti-emetics and did not report suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.
Results: Only three women in the cohort reported having had hyperemesis gravidarum although a further 17
women reported taking anti-emetics during pregnancy. Of those 1218 women who did not take anti-emetics 286
(23.5%) did not experience nausea or vomiting, 467 (38.3%) experienced nausea but not vomiting and 465
experienced vomiting (38.2%). Vomiting during pregnancy was associated with higher risk of having a low birth
weight baby (odds ratio 3.5 (1.2, 10.8), p= 0.03). The risk associated with vomiting was found in the first ( p= 0.01)
and second (p = 0.01) trimesters but not the third ( p= 1.0). The higher risk was not evident in those women who
only experienced nausea (odds ratio 1.0 (0.3, 4.0), p = 1.0).
Conclusions: Vomiting in early pregnancy, even when not perceived to be sufficiently severe to merit treatment, is
associated with a higher risk of delivering a low birth weight baby. Early pregnancy vomiting might therefore be
usable as a marker of higher risk of low birth weight in pregnancy. This may be of benefit in situations where
routine ultrasound is not available to distinguish prematurity from fetal growth restriction, so low birth weight is
used as an alternative.

Background
Low birth weight (LBW) leads to a higher risk of peri-
natal mortality and morbidity, including impaired

ity [7] and osteoporosis [ 8]. LBW can relate to one or
both of premature birth and fetal growth restriction, or
being constitutionally small, and risk of LBW can be re-

pregnancies, maternal age at birth, fetal environmental
factors such as exposure to alcohol, smoking or illicit

Abstract
Background: Low birth weight has important short- and long-term health implications. Previously it has been
shown that pregnancies affected by hyperemesis gravidarum in the mother are at higher risk of having low birth
weight offspring. In this study we tested whether such risks are also evident with less severe nausea and vomiting
in pregnancy.
Methods: One thousand two hundred thirty-eight women in the prospective Cambridge Baby Growth Study filled
in pregnancy questionnaires which included questions relating to adverse effects of pregnancy and drugs taken
during that time. Ordinal logistic regression models, adjusted for parity, ethnicity, marital and smoking status were
used to relate the risk of giving birth to low birth weight (< 2.5 kg) babies to nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy
that were not treated with anti-emetics and did not report suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum.
Results: Only three women in the cohort reported having had hyperemesis gravidarum although a further 17
women reported taking anti-emetics during pregnancy. Of those 1218 women who did not take anti-emetics 286
(23.5%) did not experience nausea or vomiting, 467 (38.3%) experienced nausea but not vomiting and 465
experienced vomiting (38.2%). Vomiting during pregnancy was associated with higher risk of having a low birth
weight baby (odds ratio 3.5 (1.2, 10.8), p= 0.03). The risk associated with vomiting was found in the first ( p= 0.01)
and second (p = 0.01) trimesters but not the third ( p= 1.0). The higher risk was not evident in those women who
only experienced nausea (odds ratio 1.0 (0.3, 4.0), p = 1.0).
Conclusions: Vomiting in early pregnancy, even when not perceived to be sufficiently severe to merit treatment, is
associated with a higher risk of delivering a low birth weight baby. Early pregnancy vomiting might therefore be
usable as a marker of higher risk of low birth weight in pregnancy. This may be of benefit in situations where
routine ultrasound is not available to distinguish prematurity from fetal growth restriction, so low birth weight is
used as an alternative.

Background
Low birth weight (LBW) leads to a higher risk of peri-
natal mortality and morbidity, including impaired
growth and cognitive development [ 1]. More long-term
complications include higher risks for high blood pres-
sure [ 2] and cardiovascular disease [ 3], impaired glucose
tolerance and type 2 diabetes [ 4], early age at menarche[5] and menopause [ 6], and reduced bone mineral dens-
ity [7] and osteoporosis [ 8]. LBW can relate to one or
both of premature birth and fetal growth restriction, or
being constitutionally small, and risk of LBW can be re-
lated to such factors as ethnic differences, multiple birth
pregnancies, maternal age at birth, fetal environmental
factors such as exposure to alcohol, smoking or illicit
drugs, maternal nutrition during pregnancy, poor socio-
economic status [ 9] and genetic defects [ 10]. Another risk

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-018-1786-1lead to maternal dehydration and weight loss. Treatment
of severe nausea and vomiting in pregnancy with anti-
emetics may even be associated with a reduction in the
prevalence of LBW [ 14,15], although such findings are by
no means universal [ 16–18].
Whilst the association between hyperemesis gravi-
darum and higher risk of LBW is reasonably well estab-
lished, what is not so clear is whether potentially less
severe nausea and/or vomiting in pregnancy is also asso-
ciated with the risk of delivering LBW babies. The only
recent related evidence suggests that it may be associ-
ated with being small for gestational age (SGA) due to
fetal growth restriction, one of the main reasons for a
baby having a LBW [ 19]. This study was therefore de-
signed to test the hypothesis that nausea and vomiting
in pregnancy, of insufficient severity to require treat-
ment, is associated with the risk of delivering a LBW
baby. To do this we used data collected for the Cam-
bridge Baby Growth Study.
Methods
Cohort
The prospective and longitudinal Cambridge Baby
Growth Study recruited 2229 mothers (and their part-
ners and offspring) attending ultrasound clinics during
early pregnancy at the Rosie Maternity Hospital,
Cambridge, United Kingdom, between 2001 and 2009
[20]. All mothers were over 16 years of age. Birth
weights of their babies, their sex and their gestational
age at birth were extracted from hospital notes, having
been recorded there by midwives. LBW was defined as a
birth weight of less than 2.5 kg. SGA was classified as
being in the lowest tenth percentile for gestational age.
Prematurity was defined as being born prior to week 37
of gestation. Categorisation according to whether or not
the participants developed gestational diabetes [ 21]o r
gestational hypertension [ 22] has been described previ-
ously. In this cohort, 96.9% of the offspring were of
white ethnicity, 0.8% were of mixed race, 0.6% were
black (African or Caribbean), 0.8% were East-Asian, and
0.9% were Indo-Asian.
Each of the study participants was given a printed
questionnaire at recruitment with questions to answer
and return once the pregnancy was completed [ 23].
They were encouraged to fill it in as the pregnancy pro-
gressed. The questionnaires included boxes to tick if the
participants had experienced nausea or had vomited
during pregnancy. If either of these boxes were ticked
there were further boxes to fill in concerning the timing
(i.e. week(s) of pregnancy) when the nausea or vomiting
were experienced. A further question asked “Have you
taken any medicine during this pregnancy? ”Those
women who responded in the affirmative were then
asked to complete a table with the following headings:“Name ”,“Disease ”,“Daily Dose ”,“No. of Days ”and
“Gestational Week(s) ”. This means that nausea and
vomiting prior to attending the booking clinic would
have had to have been recalled over a maximum period
of several weeks whereas nausea and vomiting subse-
quent to that could be recorded as the pregnancy pro-
gressed (requiring recollection over a much shorter
period of time). A total of 1238 women (54.6%) filled in
the questionnaires; those that did not were excluded
from the present analysis. For 598 of the pregnancies
where the mother failed to return a filled-in question-
naire the baby ’s birth weight was also missing. The birth
weights of the remaining babies, adjusted for pre-
pregnancy maternal BMI, gestational age at birth, parity
and sex, were not different between those that com-
pleted the questionnaire and those that did not (filled in
questionnaire 3.482 (3.456, 3.508) kg v. did not fill in
questionnaire 3.403 (3.310, 3.497) kg, p= 0.1), although
the prevalence of LBW in the offspring of the women
that returned the questionnaires was lower (filled in
questionnaire 37/1218 v. did not fill in questionnaire
27/431, p=5×1 0−3). Of those women that filled in
their questionnaires only 3 reported that they had
hyperemesis gravidarum and a further 17 were treated
with anti-emetics: cyclizine (7), promethazine (5), pro-
chlorperazine (4), metoclopramide (2), domperidone
(2), prednisolone (2), chlorphenamine (1), ondanse-
tron (1), chlorpromazine (1) and unknown (1). These
20 women were excluded from this specific analysis
in order to test only those women who had a poten-
tially milder phenotype. The self-reported timings of
exposure to nausea and/or vomiting were divided into
trimesters (first trimester being up to gestational week
12, second trimester being weeks 13 to 27 and third
trimester being from week 28 onwards).
Categorisation and calculations
We categorised each of the women into one of three dif-
ferent groups: those who reported neither nausea nor
vomiting ( n= 286), those who reported nausea but not
vomiting ( n= 467) and those who reported vomiting
(n= 465, 432 of whom reported nausea and vomiting
and 33 who reported vomiting without nausea). Those
that reported vomiting without nausea had no evidence
of concurrent urinary or chest infections, or evidence of
the vomiting occurring just in the final trimester of
pregnancy. The body mass indexes (BMI) were calcu-
lated dividing the maternal weights prior to pregnancy
by their heights squared.
Statistical analysis
Associations with LBW were adjusted for the following
confounders: parity, marital and smoking statuses, and
ethnicity [ 24]. Associations between nausea and vomitingPetry et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:133 Page 2 of 8and quantitative continuous variables (such as BMI and
maternal age) were tested using linear regression models
(adjusted for confounders where necessary). Associations
with dichotomous variables (such as LBW) were tested
using ordinal logistic regression (adjusted for confounders
where necessary), the χ2-test or Fisher ’s exact test as
appropriate. Unless otherwise stated all other data are
presented as means (95% confidence intervals (CI)).
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata 13
(StataCorp LP , College Station, Texas, U.S.A.). P<0 . 0 5
was considered statistically significant throughout.
Results
Maternal clinical characteristics
Table 1shows the clinical characteristics of the different
groups tested. Those 465 women who experienced
vomiting during pregnancy (432 of whom also reported
nausea) tended to be younger ( p= 1.5 × 10−3) and
slightly heavier/more obese (pre-pregnancy weight p= 0.02,
pre-pregnancy BMI p= 0.01) than those women who did
not experience nausea or vomiting in pregnancy. These dif-
ferences in clinical character istics from those women who
did not experience nausea or vo miting, were not evident in
those women who experienced nausea but not vomiting.
Associations between maternal exposure to nausea and/
or vomiting in pregnancy and birth characteristics of the
baby
The delivery of LBW babies was more common in those
women who experienced vomiting in pregnancy (when
adjusted for confounders) than in those women who did
not experience vomiting or nausea ( p= 0.03; Table 2).
This relationship was still evident after further adjustmentwas made for maternal BMI prior to pregnancy (OR 3.1
(1.0, 9.7), p= 0.048). In contrast there was no higher risk
of LBW associated with experiencing nausea but not
vomiting in pregnancy ( p=1 . 0 ) .
Table 2shows other birth characteristics of women ac-
cording to their experience of nausea and vomiting in
pregnancy. Despite the differences in risk of LBW, there
was no apparent difference in mean birth weight, gesta-
tional age at birth or prevalence of prematurity or SGA.
Similarly there was no apparent difference in the birth
weight adjusted for pre-pregnancy maternal BMI, gesta-
tional age at birth, sex and parity. However there was a
slightly higher proportion of female babies born to
mothers who experienced vomiting during pregnancy.
Figure 1shows Kernel density estimation plots for un-
adjusted birth weight, gestational age at birth and birth
weight for gestational age according to maternal expos-
ure to nausea and vomiting in pregnancy. Small differ-
ences in the distributions of these were evident in each
plot.
Associations between exposure to vomiting in different
trimesters of pregnancy and birth characteristics of the
baby
The higher prevalence of giving birth to LBW babies in
women who experienced vomiting was evident in those
who experienced it in the first (OR 4.3 (1.4, 13.2), p=0 . 0 1 ,
n= 266 vomiting and n= 204 no nausea or vomiting) or
second (OR 4.4 (1.4, 13.9), p = 0.01, n= 185 vomiting and
n = 204 no nausea or vomiting) trimester of pregnancy.
However it was not evident in those who experienced it in
the third trimester (OR 1.0 (1.0, 1.0), n=3 6v o m i t i n ga n d
204 no nausea or vomiting, p=1 . 0 ) .

Vomiting in pregnancy, not treated with anti-emetics, is
associated with a higher risk of giving birth to LBW ba-
bies in this study. This is consistent with reported asso-
ciations between LBW (or related phenotypes such as
SGA) and hyperemesis gravidarum [ 11–13,25–28], al-
though such associations are not universal findings
[29–32]. Nausea and vomiting with no reference to
hyperemesis gravidarum has also been associated with
a higher risk of LBW [ 33] and decreased birth weight
[34] in some other studies, although no difference in
risk was reported in others [ 19,35–37]. Although a
systematic review [ 38] reported a lower risk of LBW
in association with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy
the studies that it was based looked at anti-emetic
use to categories study participants [ 14,15]. This is
therefore very different to our own study where we
specifically excluded women who took anti-emetics in
case these drugs affected pathways involved in regu-
lating LBW risk [ 39]. Similarly the very large Norwe-
gian Mother and Child Cohort Study [ 40]f o u n d
reduced population rates of LBW in association withnausea and vomiting in pregnancy, but did so without
specifically excluding those women who took anti-
emetics in pregnancy. Our study therefore presents
results a slightly different population to those exam-
ined in other investigations, and one where we specif-
ically investigated a potentially milder negative aspect
of pregnancy than hyperemesis gravidarum.
This higher risk for LBW associated with vomiting,
and nausea but just in the second trimester, appeared to
be in the first two trimesters of pregnancy with an ap-
parent lack of risk in the third trimester. Studies are on-
going to try and discover whether or not nausea and
vomiting in pregnancy and resulting associations are
genetically mediated [ 41,42]. With an overall odds ratio
of 3.5 for LBW in our population, vomiting in early
pregnancy may be a marker of risk for LBW that is use-
ful for its prediction in conjunction with other risk fac-
tors. Where routine ultrasound is available small babies
tend to be assessed as either SGA (possibly due to fetal
growth restriction) and/or premature rather than LBW,
but the link with vomiting may be useful in areas where
such scans are not available and LBW is used toTable 2 Birth related factors of babies of women in the Cambridge Baby Growth Study who returned their questionnaires,

Nausea alone refers to those women who experience d nausea in pregnancy but not vomiting. Vomiting refers to those women who experienced vomiting
during pregnancy, independently of whether or not they also experienced nausea. Birth weight is presented both unadjusted and adjusted for pre-preg nancy maternal
BMI, gestational age at birth, parity, multi-fetal pregnancy and sex. LBW OR was adjusted for parity, marital status, ethnicity and maternal smoking status. Data are mean
(95% CI) or number (%)Petry et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:133 Page 4 of 8Fig. 1 (See legend on next page.)Petry et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2018) 18:133 Page 5 of 8encompass them both. Nausea and vomiting in preg-
nancy are thought to be protective towards the embryo/
fetus in terms of reducing exposure to food borne harm-
ful substances such as infective microorganisms [ 43],
and they can lead to changes in the maternal dietary in-
take [ 44]. There is evidence that this can lead to positive
effects on the fetus such as decreased rates of miscar-
riage and congenital malformations [ 45]. Whilst poten-
tially being an advantage in a mild form, in excess it is
possible that this vomiting might reduce nutrient deliv-
ery to the fetus leading to the greater risk of LBW [ 46].
The fact that in our population as a whole there was no
apparent decrease in mean birth weight despite the
higher prevalence of LBW suggests that whilst there is a
negative impact of vomiting on birth weight for some
babies, in other babies a protective advantage may be
evident [ 43]. The Kernel density estimation plot for birth
weight in our population (Fig. 1(a)) would appear to be
consistent with this suggestion (as birth weight density
around the mean appeared to be higher in those women
affected by vomiting).
LBW often relates to the baby undergoing fetal growth
restriction and/or being born prematurely. Given the in-
crease in birth weight usually observed in male babies,
in general there is also a slightly increased risk of LBW
in female babies compared to males [ 9]. In our popula-
tion despite the association between vomiting and LBW,
we did not find further significant independent associa-
tions between exposure to vomiting in pregnancy and
the prevalence of SGA (a group that may have been
enriched with babies who underwent fetal growth re-
striction) or premature births or the gestational age at
birth. Looking at the Kernel density estimation plots for
birth weight in our population below the cut off for
LBW the line for women who experienced vomiting was
clearly a little higher than those representing the other
groups (Fig. 1(a)). The differences between the groups
below the cut offs in the gestational ages at birth (to as-
sess the densities related to prematurity) and the birth
weights for gestational age (to assess the densities re-
lated to SGA) plots were smaller though (Fig. 1(b) and
(c)). Further studies are required to validate these find-
ings in other cohorts, especially those that are better
able to distinguish whether the LBW relates more to
SGA (and therefore probably fetal growth restriction),
prematurity or a mix of the two.Whilst we could not ascribe the increased risk of LBW to
fetal growth restriction or premature birth we did note a
slight excess of pregnant women carrying female babies.
This excess has previously been observed with hyperemesis
gravidarum [ 47]. We recently reported that serum GDF-15
concentrations around week 15 of pregnancy were higher
in those women reporting vomiting in the second trimester
of pregnancy in the Cambridge Baby Growth Study [ 48], a
hormone that may stimulate vomiting in pregnancy [ 49].
Interestingly we have also observed an increased concentra-
tion of week 15 serum GDF-15 concentrations in women
carrying females compared to those carryin g males in our
population (Petry et al., unpu blished observation), which
may explain the slight excess of pregnant women carrying
females in the group that experienced vomiting.
The main strengths of this study are its prospective na-
ture and the fact that its design enabled us to study a group
of women with a potentially milder, albeit still unpleasant
phenotype than has been tested in other published studies.
We have therefore uniquely been able to observe that the
risk of giving birth to a LBW baby is higher with vomiting.
The study ’s main limitation is that the nausea and vomiting
and the taking of any anti-emetics to treat it were self-
reported. The analysis could therefore have been affected
by recall bias [ 50], although given that the women were en-
couraged to fill in their questionnaires as their pregnancies
progressed rather than retrospectively the effects of this
may have been limited. Indeed effects of any recall bias
were clearly not sufficient to prevent us from discovering
our association between increased circulating GDF-15 con-
centrations and second trimester vomiting [ 48]. Another
limitation of our study may be a slight lack of statistical
power to investigate potential effects of confounders .How-
ever there was clearly sufficient power in our study to test
associations between the maternal experience of nausea
and vomiting in pregnancy and the risk of delivering LBW
babies. The final main limitation may be exclusion of
women who took anti-emetics during pregnancy. This is
because the threshold for nausea and vomiting where
women sought and were then prescribed anti-emetics
w o u l dh a v ev a r i e df r o mp a r t i c i p a n tt op a r t i c i p a n t ,a n d
therefore the exclusion could have been rather self-
selecting. However the advantage of doing this is the lack
of potential confounding in our study of these drugs affect-
ing pathways involved in regulating fetal growth, a strength
of the study.(See figure on previous page.)

This study suggests that vomiting in early pregnancy
of insufficient severity to merit self-selected treatment
with anti-emetics is associated with a higher risk of a
woman giving birth to a LBW baby. It is possible that
this vomiting may therefore be a marker of LBW
pregnancies. This could be useful in situations where
routine ultrasound is not available to distinguish pre-
maturity from being SGA, so LBW is used as an al-
ternative to encompass them both.

Objective— We utilized an updated nationally representative database to examine associations 
between maternal age and prevalence of maternal morbidity during complications of labor and 
delivery.
Study design— We used hospital inpatient billing data from the 2009 United States Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample (NIS), part of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). To determine 
whether the likelihood that maternal morbidity during complications of labor and delivery differed 
among age groups, separate logistic regression models were run for each complication. Age was 
the main independent variable of interest.
Results— In analyses that controlled for demographics and clinical confounders, we found that 
complications with the highest odds among women, 11–18 years of age, compared to 25–29 year 
old women, included preterm delivery, chorioamnionitis, endometritis, and mild preeclampsia. 
Pregnant women who were 15–19 years old had greater odds for severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, 
postpartum hemorrhage, poor fetal growth, and fetal distress. Pregnant women who were ≥35 
years old had greater odds for preterm delivery, hypertension, superimposed preeclampsia, severe 
preeclampsia, and decreased risk for chorioamnionitis. Older women (≥40 years old) had 
increased odds for mild preeclampsia, fetal distress, and poor fetal growth.
Conclusions— Our findings underscore the need for pregnant women to be aware of the risks 
associated with extremes of age so that they can watch for signs and symptoms of such 
complications.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether women with early pregnancy elevated blood pressure or 
stage 1 hypertension exhibit increased risk of preeclampsia and maternal or neonatal morbidity.
METHODS: We conducted a clinical cohort study of 18,162 women who delivered a singleton 
infant from 2015 to 2018 and attended at least two prenatal appointments before 20 weeks. Data 
were collected within the Magee Obstetric Maternal and Infant database, an aggregate of prenatal 
and delivery health records. Early pregnancy blood pressure (BP) was defined as average BP prior 
to 20 weeks of gestation, and women were classified with normal, elevated BP, stage 1 or 2 
hypertension according to current guidelines. The primary outcome was preeclampsia. Secondary 
outcomes were severe maternal morbidity, placental abruption, gestational diabetes, and composite 
neonatal morbidity.
RESULTS: Overall, 75.2% of the women were categorized with normal BP, 13.9% with elevated 
BP, 5.4% with stage 1 hypertension, and 5.5% with stage 2 hypertension. Risk of preeclampsia 
increased in a stepwise fashion with increasing BP category, adjusted for covariates (normal BP, 
4.7%, referent; elevated BP, 7.3%, aOR 1.29 [95%CI: 1.07, 1.56]; stage 1, 12.3%, aOR 2.35 
[95%CI: 1.86, 2.96]), and stage 2, 30.2%, aOR 6.49 [95%CI: 5.34, 7.89]). Results were similar 
among black and white women. Gestational diabetes was more prevalent among women with stage 
1 (11.4%; aOR 1.50 [95%CI: 1.18, 1.91]) and stage 2 hypertension (14.2%; aOR 1.65 [95%CI: 
1.30, 2.10]). Severe maternal morbidity and neonatal morbidity were increased only among 
women with stage 2 hypertension (aOR 2.99 [95%CI: 2.26, 3.99], and aOR 2.67 [95%CI 2.28,

Precis
Entering pregnancy with elevated blood pressure, stage 1, or stage 2 hypertension classified by 
2017 cardiovascular society guidelines is associated with an increased preeclampsia risk.
INTRODUCTION
The American College of Cardiology (ACC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) 
Task Force on Clinical Practice guidelines revised the criteria for diagnosis of hypertension 
in adults in 2017, recommending a downward shift in hypertension classification criteria.( 1) 
Adults who previously would have been diagnosed with prehypertension are now divided 
into two categories of elevated blood pressure (systolic blood pressure [SBP] 120–129 
mmHg and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] < 80 mmHg) or stage 1 hypertension (SBP 130–
139 mmHg or DBP 80–89 mmHg). Blood pressure above this range is now considered stage 
2 hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg). This new classification of blood 
pressure was supported by evidence that modest elevations in blood pressure among adult 
men and non-pregnant adult women increase risk for cardiovascular disease and was 
designed to encourage clinicians to counsel and intervene early in the life course to improve 
cardiovascular health.( 2) While the evidence supporting the 2017 guidelines was primarily 
derived from older adult populations, recent evidence suggests that young men and women 
with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension by the 2017 ACC and AHA guidelines 
have a higher risk of subsequent cardiovascular events than normotensive young adults.( 3)
The implications of these new criteria for reproductive-age women are unclear. The 
prevalence of hypertension in young adult women (20–44 years old) increased from 10% to 
19% with application of the current hypertension guidelines compared to the former criteria. 
(1) Therefore, more women will enter pregnancy with a diagnosis of preexisting 
hypertension. It is well established that pregnant women with what is now defined as stage 2 
hypertension have higher rates of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications than 
normotensive women, including preeclampsia, cesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage, 
hypertension-induced end-organ damage, gestational diabetes, placental abruption, fetal 
growth restriction, and perinatal mortality.( 4, 5) Moreover, women with pre-existing 
hypertension and those who develop preeclampsia have an increased risk of future 
cardiovascular disease.( 6–10) What is unknown is whether newly pregnant women with 
elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension also have increased risks of preeclampsia 
and maternal or neonatal morbidity. Neither the 2017 ACC and AHA guidelines, nor recent 
recommendations from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) 
(11) provide guidance regarding how women with early pregnancy elevated blood pressure 
or stage 1 hypertension should be managed due to the lack of evidence.
We aimed to investigate whether women with elevated BP or stage 1 hypertension in early 
pregnancy exhibit an increased risk for preeclampsia and adverse maternal or neonatal 
outcomes compared to normotensive women. We also investigated whether the relationship 
between early pregnancy blood pressure and preeclampsia risk was modified by race. The Sutton et al. Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptprimary outcome was preeclampsia, and secondary outcomes included severe maternal 
morbidity, placental abruption, gestational diabetes, and a neonatal morbidity composite 
score. We hypothesized that there will be an increasing, step-wise association between 2017 
ACC and AHA blood pressure groups and risk, such that women with elevated BP, stage 1 
hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension will have increasing risks of preeclampsia, maternal 
morbidity, and neonatal morbidity.
METHODS
We conducted a clinical cohort study using data collected from the Magee Obstetric 
Maternal and Infant database (MOMI, Magee-Womens Research Institute, Pittsburgh, 
Pennsylvania). Established in 1995, data are aggregated from prenatal and delivery health 
records for women who give birth at Magee-Womens Hospital (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). 
State-level birth certificate data are also available for each patient in the database. The 
Magee Obstetric Maternal and Infant database is regularly reviewed by an honest broker for 
quality control by comparison to patient charts and examination of frequencies for outliers. 
The study was approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review Board and 
supported by grants from the Richard King Mellon Foundation, ID8069, Magee Obstetrical 
Maternal & Infant (MOMI) Database; the American Heart Association Go Red for Women

The current study included women who delivered a singleton infant at or after 20 weeks of 
gestation at Magee-Womens Hospital between January 1, 2015, and June 30, 2018 and who 
attended at least two prenatal appointments before 20 weeks of gestation (n=18,162). Blood 
pressure elevations recorded prior to 20 weeks of gestation are considered by obstetric 
guidelines to characterize chronic (preexisting) hypertension, ( 5, 11) and we required at least 
two early pregnancy visits to minimize the influence of a single spurious clinic blood 
pressure measurement. Women were excluded if they had missing blood pressure 
measurements at prenatal visits, unknown gestational age at delivery, or suspected inaccurate 
blood pressure measurements (SBP<70 mmHg or DBP<40 mmHg). Additionally, only first 
births were included for women who had more than one delivery within the study period. In 
general, women who were included in the final cohort and women who were excluded due 
to a lack of prenatal record or insufficient blood pressure data had similar baseline 
characteristics including age, race, body mass index (BMI), and frequency of nulliparity; 
more excluded women were smokers (Appendix 1).
Blood pressure was measured at the patients’ prenatal visits according to the protocol of 
each individual obstetric practice and was not regulated by a research protocol. Women were 
classified as having normal blood pressure, elevated blood pressure, stage 1 hypertension, or 
stage 2 hypertension based on the 2017 ACC and AHA guidelines using the average of all 
available clinic blood pressure measurements prior to 20 weeks of gestation (2.9 ± 0.9 
prenatal visits). The normal BP group determination required women to have both an Sutton et al. Page 3

blood pressure group included women with average SBP between 120 and 129 mmHg and 
average DBP < 80 mmHg. Stage 1 hypertension was identified by an average SBP between 
130–139 mmHg or an average DBP between 80–89 mmHg. If average SBP or DBP 
exceeded either of the stage 1 hypertension ranges, women were considered to have stage 2 
hypertension. Women with chronic (pre-pregnancy) hypertension identified using diagnostic 
codes were grouped into the stage 2 hypertension category, regardless of early pregnancy 
measurements.
Primary and secondary outcomes were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic and 
procedure codes, admitting and discharge data, and other medical record features (Appendix 
2). Preterm preeclampsia was defined as mild or severe preeclampsia, HELLP, or eclampsia, 
and having delivered before 37 weeks of gestation; term cases delivered at or after 37 weeks. 
Severe maternal morbidity was defined according to Main et al (12) if women met one of 
three conditions: one of 21 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-determined 
indicators (Appendix 3),( 13) admittance to the intensive care unit, or prolonged postpartum 
length-of-stay (Appendices 2 and 3). Prolonged postpartum length-of-stay was defined as a 
stay longer than three standard deviations above the mean postpartum length-of-stay for the 
study time period, stratified by mode of delivery (mean length-of-stay 1.93 ± 0.73 days for 
vaginal delivery and 3.11 ± 0.95 days for Cesarean delivery). Gestational diabetes was 
diagnosed according to Carpenter-Coustan criteria (at least two values > 95, 180, 155, or 140 
mg/dL at fasting, one, two, and three hours, respectively, after a 100-g glucose load; a 3-
hour glucose tolerance test was performed for a 1-hour glucose screening test value > 135 
mg/dL). The neonatal composite outcome included at least one of the following: intrauterine 
fetal death after 20 weeks of gestation, neonatal death within 28 days of life, 5-minute Apgar 
less than 7, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, small-for-gestational age 
according to national birth weight standards ( 14), or preterm birth (gestational age < 37 
weeks at delivery).
Clinical and demographic characteristics of the analysis cohort are described by mean and 
standard deviation for continuous variables and by frequency and percentages for categorical 
variables. Patient characteristics across hypertension groups are compared using ANOV A for 
continuous variables and Pearson chi-square or its exact alternative when cell frequencies 
were small for categorical variables. Incidence of preeclampsia across hypertension groups 
was compared using logistic regression with pair-wise comparisons conducted using linear 
contrasts. We reported the results as odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals 
(CI). We also fit a multivariable logistic regression model with preeclampsia as the binary 
outcome and hypertension categories, age, race, BMI, smoking status, pre-existing diabetes, 
parity, number of visits before 20 weeks, gestational age at first prenatal visit and average 
time between prenatal visits were covariates. Results from the model are presented as 
adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and corresponding 95% CI. We have a small proportion (at 
maximum <6%) of participants having missing data on BMI (n=1073 missing), current 
smoking (n=1083 missing), gestational weight gain (n=1220 missing) and parity (n=752 
missing). We do not anticipate that the likelihood of missing these covariates is associated 
with the outcome. Therefore, a missing at random assumption was reasonable. Likelihood-Sutton et al. Page 4

paper provide valid estimates.
Considering the elevated BP and stage 2 hypertensive groups had higher percentages of 
African American women, we also fit the above logistic regression models stratified by race. 
Incidences of maternal complications (gestational diabetes, placental abruption, severe 
maternal morbidity) are reported as frequencies and percentages and compared across 
hypertension categories using Pearson chi-square test or its exact version as appropriate. We 
then repeated the above modeling strategy for the following: preterm preeclampsia, term 
eclampsia, severe maternal morbidity, placental abruption, gestational diabetes, and 
composite neonatal morbidity.
All p-values reported were two sided. The analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina).
RESULTS
There were 30,244 deliveries during the study period. Of these, 12,082 were excluded due 
to: lack of prenatal record (n=5570, largely due to transfers from community hospitals), non-
singleton pregnancy (n=538), fewer than two prenatal visits prior to 20 weeks of gestation 
(n=5323), second delivery within study interval (n=630), and missing or indeterminate blood 
pressure data (n=21; Figure 1). The final study population included 18,162 women. To 
ensure we did not introduce selection bias by excluding women who did not receive prenatal 
care (based on the lack of prenatal record), we matched the 5570 women with no prenatal 
record in our database with their state-level birth record data to ascertain gestational age at 
initiation of prenatal care. Of those 5570 women, 4631 (83.1%) reported initiation of 
prenatal care at or before 12 weeks of gestation, and therefore we concluded that these 
women received care outside of the hospital system used for this study. The remaining 
women reported no prenatal care (n=902; 16.2%) or prenatal care initiated at or after 16 
weeks of gestation (n=37; 0.7%).
By the 2017 ACC and AHA blood pressure guidelines, 75.2% (n=13,640) of women were 
categorized with early pregnancy normal BP, 13.9% (n=2,529) with elevated BP, 5.4% 
(n=988) with stage 1 hypertension, and 5.5% (n=1,005) with stage 2 hypertension. Per the 
guidelines, women only needed to meet the SBP or the DBP criterion for each BP category. 
For example, 101/988 (10%) of women met both systolic and diastolic BP criteria for stage 
1 hypertension, while 216/988 (22%) met only the systolic criterion, and 670/988 (68%) met 
only the diastolic criterion (Appendix 4). Most women in the stage 2 hypertension group 
(836/1005; 83%) were classified based on diagnostic codes rather than BP criteria 
(Appendix 4). No data were available in our dataset on antihypertensive medication use.
As severity of blood pressure classification increased (elevated < stage 1 hypertension < 
stage 2 hypertension), women tended to be older, more obese, and more likely to have 
preexisting diabetes (Table 1). Women with elevated BP and stage 2 hypertension were more 
likely to be of Black race (Table 1).Sutton et al. Page 5
Obstet Gynecol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 July 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptA total of 1,249 cases of preeclampsia (6.9%) occurred among our cohort. The incidence of 
preeclampsia increased in stepwise fashion with increasing BP category from 4.7% in the 
normal BP group to 7.3% in the elevated BP group, 12.3% in the stage 1 hypertension 
group, and 30.2% in the stage 2 hypertension group (Figure 2). Compared to women with 
normal BP, the odds of preeclampsia increased from 1.59 (95% CI 1.35, 1.89) in the elevated 
BP group to 2.86 (95% CI 2.33, 3.52) in the stage 1 hypertension group to 8.77 (95% CI 
7.50, 10.25) in the stage 2 hypertension group (Table 2). In adjusted analyses accounting for 
baseline differences among groups in age, race, BMI, smoking status, preexisting diabetes, 
parity, number of prenatal visits prior to 20 weeks, gestational age at first prenatal visit, and 
average time between visits, the odds of preeclampsia increased from 1.29 (95% CI 1.07, 
1.56) to 2.35 (95% CI 1.86, 2.96) to 6.49 (95% CI 5.34, 7.89) among women with elevated 
BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension, respectively, compared to normotensive 
women (Table 2). Among women with elevated BP, this increase in the odds of preeclampsia 
was driven by an increase in preterm preeclampsia. Among women with stage 1 and stage 2 
hypertension, increased odds of both term and preterm preeclampsia were observed, albeit 
with a greater increased odds of risk for preterm compared to term preeclampsia (Table 2).
Black race was associated with higher risk of preeclampsia (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.15, 1.57), 
but there was no statistical evidence of effect modification by race in our overall model or in 
analyses stratified by gestational age at delivery (p=0.56 for multiplicative interaction 
between race and hypertension in total preeclampsia; p=0.25 for preterm preeclampsia; 
p=0.38 for term preeclampsia). When stratified by race, a similar pattern of increasing odds 
of preeclampsia with higher blood pressure category was seen in both black and white 
women (Table 2).
To evaluate for other sequelae of elevated BP and hypertension, we determined the 
incidences of severe maternal morbidity, placental abruption, and gestational diabetes. While 
there was a stepwise increase in incidence of severe maternal morbidity with increasing BP 
category (from 2.6% to 2.9% to 3.5% to 12.4% among women with normal BP, elevated BP, 
stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension, respectively; Table 3), the unadjusted and 
adjusted odds of severe maternal morbidity were only increased among women with stage 2 
hypertension (OR 5.33 [95% CI 4.30, 6.61]; aOR 2.99 [95% CI 2.26, 3.99]). Women with 
elevated BP (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.32, 1.82), stage 1 hypertension (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.88, 
2.86), and stage 2 hypertension (OR 2.98, 95% CI 2.46, 3.61) had a stepwise increase in the 
odds of gestational diabetes, compared to normotensive women (Table 3). Accounting for 
covariates including BMI, the adjusted odds of gestational diabetes were more modestly 
increased across groups (elevated BP aOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.00–1.45; stage 1 hypertension 
aOR 1.50, 95% CI 1.18, 1.91; stage 2 hypertension aOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.30, 2.10). The 
overall incidence of placental abruption in the total cohort was low (1.4%), and the odds of 
placental abruption were not increased for any group.
The incidence of neonatal morbidity (a composite of intrauterine fetal death after 20 weeks 
of gestation, neonatal death within 28 days of life, 5-minute Apgar less than 7, NICU 
admission, SGA, and preterm birth) was 22.6% in the normotensive group, 25.7% in the 
elevated BP group, 24.0% in the stage 1 hypertension group, and 44.4% in the stage 2 
hypertension group (Table 3). The rates of NICU admission, 5-minute Apgar <7, SGA, and Sutton et al. Page 6

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptboth spontaneous and indicated preterm birth were each associated with severity of maternal 
blood pressure group (p<0.007, Table 4). In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, only 
stage 2 hypertension was associated with increased odds of neonatal morbidity (OR 2.73, 
95% CI 2.39, 3.11; aOR 2.67, 95% CI 2.28, 3.12) (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In this large clinical cohort, elevated BP, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension in 
early pregnancy were associated with an increased risk for preeclampsia, with the severity of 
hypertension associated with higher risks. The risk of preeclampsia associated with stage 2 
hypertension in early pregnancy has been well established, and our study adds to the 
accumulating evidence that a new population of women – those with SBP ranging from 
120–139 mmHg and DBP ranging from 80–89 mmHg in early pregnancy – are also at 
increased risk for preeclampsia. Our findings highlight the importance of early pregnancy 
blood pressure elevations, which may reflect pre-pregnancy blood pressure status, and 
suggest that the revised 2017 ACC and AHA hypertension guidelines can identify women 
early in pregnancy who may benefit from increased surveillance for signs and symptoms of 
preeclampsia.
Our results are consistent other studies evaluating the 2017 ACC and AHA definition of 
stage 1 hypertension in pregnancy. In two secondary analyses of prophylactic low-dose 
aspirin trials to reduce risk for preeclampsia conducted in the 1990s, Sutton et al. and 
Hauspurg et al. demonstrated increased risk of preeclampsia as well as preterm delivery and 
gestational diabetes in women newly classified with stage 1 hypertension using the 2017 
ACC and AHA guideline.( 15, 16) A recent secondary analysis of the Nulliparous Pregnancy 
Outcome Study: Monitoring Mother-to-Be cohort (NuMoM2b study) also found elevated 
blood pressure and stage 1 hypertension categorized in first trimester with the 2017 ACC 
and AHA guidelines were associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia.( 17) Finally, a 
large retrospective cohort study of low-risk patients from China found increased rates of 
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, and low birth 
weight among women with stage 1 hypertension, compared to normotensive controls.( 18) 
This study categorized women by BP assessed at a single time point prior to 20 weeks of 
gestation.
We extend these findings in several ways. Our study examines a large and contemporary 
clinical cohort in the United States considering multiple clinical blood pressure 
measurements, evaluating both term and preterm disease, including nulliparous and parous 
patients, and evaluating race differences and maternal and neonatal morbidity. We 
demonstrate that women with elevated BP in early pregnancy have excess preeclampsia risk 
compared to those with normal BP, and that this association is driven by black women with 
preterm preeclampsia. Further, as the early pregnancy blood pressure category increases, the 
risk for gestational diabetes increases in a monotonic fashion.
Our findings may have immediate relevance for primary care providers caring for 
reproductive age women. Both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions to lower 
blood pressure and to address other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as obesity, Sutton et al. Page 7
Obstet Gynecol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 July 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptglucose intolerance, and hyperlipidemia, have the potential to improve future maternal and 
fetal health. Considering that our results demonstrated increased rates of obesity and 
gestational diabetes among women with elevated BP and stage 1 hypertension, 
implementing lifestyle interventions to address cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors 
could be beneficial in affected women.( 19)
Our findings also provoke questions regarding first-time diagnosis of elevated blood 
pressure or stage 1 hypertension during early pregnancy. How such early pregnancy 
diagnosis may translate to prenatal management is not yet known, and randomized trials will 
be required to identify prevention and management strategies among women with these 
early pregnancy blood pressure elevations. In the meantime, lifestyle modifications such as 
dietary improvements and exercise programs that improve cardiometabolic health during 
pregnancy are safe and effective, and may be relevant when blood pressure is elevated.( 20) 
During pregnancy, low-dose aspirin is currently the only intervention with demonstrated 
efficacy for reducing the risk of preterm preeclampsia in high-risk women,( 21–25) including 
those entering pregnancy with chronic hypertension.( 26) Aspirin is a cost-effective 
intervention( 27, 28) with an excellent risk-benefit profile in pregnancy,( 21, 22, 25) and its 
widespread use for preeclampsia prevention has been advocated.( 27–29) Thus, it may be 
reasonable to recommend this low-cost( 28) medication for the newly identified population 
of at-risk women, although trials are needed to characterize its efficacy among these women. 
Medical tests routinely employed in pregnant women with stage 2 hypertension (additional 
laboratory studies, ultrasounds, and antenatal fetal surveillance) are of unknown utility in 
women with lower-range hypertension. Our study did not find higher rates of small-for-
gestational-age infants or adverse neonatal outcomes among women with elevated BP and 
stage 1 hypertension. Therefore, our data are not sufficient to recommend increased 
antenatal fetal surveillance for these women. Moreover, limiting increased fetal surveillance 
would likely help avoid iatrogenic morbidity in this population.
Our study has limitations that should be considered. First, blood pressure measurements in 
our study were clinical measures collected during the routine care of women at many 
medical offices. It is likely that many measurements were collected without full adherence to 
all recommendations regarding BP assessment methodology. This lack of protocol is a 
limitation but, on balance, does reflect medical practice outside of research protocols. As 
recommended by the ACC and AHA guidelines ( 1), diagnostic classification was based on 
the average of at least two measures. The use of routinely measured blood pressure is a 
pragmatic approach and potentially enhances the generalizability of our findings. 
Consideration should also be given to the absence of information about antihypertensive 
medication use in our database. Given that 83% of women in the stage 2 hypertension group 
had blood pressures below the range of stage 2 hypertension (i.e., SBP < 140 mmHg and 
DBP < 90 mmHg), we speculate that misclassification bias may be modest, as these women 
were still identified by their diagnostic codes. The lower measured blood pressures in this 
group might be due to a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment and 
to the physiologic lowering of blood pressure in early pregnancy. It is notable that despite 
such a small proportion of women in the stage 2 hypertension group having measured blood 
pressures in the stage 2 hypertension range, this group still had the highest risk of 
preeclampsia and maternal and neonatal morbidity.Sutton et al. Page 8
Obstet Gynecol . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 July 01.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptRestricting our analysis to women who had at least two prenatal visits prior to 20 weeks of 
gestation might introduce selection bias, as women with medical comorbidities might be 
more likely to establish early prenatal care. Indeed, we noted slightly more prenatal visits 
prior to 20 weeks in the stage 2 hypertension group, and we controlled for the number of 
prenatal visits in our adjusted analyses. In comparing the baseline characteristics and rate of 
outcomes between patients included and excluded in our final cohort, we noted many 
similarities (Appendix 1), and thus the influence of selection bias is likely minimal. The data 
in this study are from a single institution, which might limit generalizability. Yet, Magee-
Womens Hospital provides care for a diverse population of both low- and high-risk patients 
from a large geographical area, and providers range from certified nurse midwives to family 
medicine physicians to general obstetricians and maternal-fetal medicine specialists.
Another limitation is our reliance on diagnostic codes which may misclassify preeclampsia 
and other obstetric conditions. We cannot confirm the diagnostic criteria that were used to 
diagnose preeclampsia in each patient in our cohort. However, use of diagnostic codes is a 
routine epidemiologic and clinical cohort approach, and data in the Magee Obstetric 
Maternal and Infant database are regularly evaluated to assure accuracy and completeness. 
Additionally, a validation study in the subset of women with chronic hypertension with 
superimposed preeclampsia diagnoses (the subgroup with the most complex medical 
records) demonstrated that among these 322 women, 95% had a clinical diagnosis of 
preeclampsia in the medical record. The primary strength of this study is the large, 
contemporary cohort of women with prenatal, delivery, and neonatal data and our ability to 
evaluate maternal morbidity.
Application of new blood pressure criteria in early pregnancy may identify women at risk 
for preeclampsia, particularly preterm preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes. While the 
excess risk identified in our study is modest, particularly among women with elevated blood 
pressure, there is now accumulating observational evidence from both research and clinical 
cohorts that women with elevated BP and stage 1 hypertension are at increased risk of 
obstetric and maternal morbidity. The magnitudes of increased risk noted in our study are 
comparable to those previously reported. Thus, we are assured that the observed associations 
between early pregnancy blood pressure elevations and adverse outcomes are real and that 
there is now sufficient observational evidence to consider how to incorporate these lower 
blood pressure thresholds into obstetrical care. For example, newly designed trials of 
interventions for preeclampsia risk reduction in women with elevated blood pressure and 
stage 1 hypertension in early pregnancy are warranted. Such trials could drive changes in 
risk identification, improved prenatal maternal monitoring, and perhaps improved maternal 
outcomes. Our results are also relevant to general clinicians caring for reproductive age 
women, as the new blood pressure guidelines may identify risks that could impact future 
pregnancies. Given the well-described association between hypertensive disorders of 
pregnancy and future cardiovascular risk, interventions for reproductive-age women may 
have lifelong and multigenerational cardiovascular benefit.

Background: Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a complex process influenced by multiple personal,
psychological and societal factors. Traditionally, the risk perception of healthcare professionals has been presented as
more objective and authoritative than that of pregnant w omen. Doctors have been presented as more concerned with
biomedical risk than midwives. Such dichotomies oversimplify and obscure the complexity of the process. This study
examines pregnancy-related risk perception in women and healthcare professionals, and what women and professionals
believe about each other ’s risk perception.
Methods: A cross sectional survey of set in UK maternity services. Participants were doctors working in obstetrics ( N=5 3 ) ,
midwives ( N= 59), pregnant women ( N= 68). Participants were recruited in person from two hospitals. Doctors
were also recruited online. Participants completed a qu estionnaire measuring the degree of perceived risk in
various childbirth-related scenarios; and the extent to which they believed others agreed with them about the degree
of risk generally involved in childbirth. Main outcome measures were the degree of risk perceived to the mother in
baby in pregnancy scenarios, and beliefs about own perception of risk in comparison to their own group and other
groups.
Results: There were significant differences in total risk sco res between pregnant women, doctors and midwives in
perception of risk to the mother in 68/80 scenarios. Doct ors most frequently rated risks lowest. Total scores for
perceived risk to the baby were not significantly different. There was substantial variation within each group. There was
more agreement on the ranking of scenarios according t or i s k .E a c hg r o u pb e l i e v e dd o c t o r sp e r c e i v e dm o s t
risk whereas actually doctors most frequently rated ris ks lowest. Each group incorrectly believed their peers
rated risk similarly to themselves.
Conclusions: Individuals cannot assume others share their perception of risk or that they make correct assessments
regarding others ’risk perception. Further research should consider what factors are taken into account when making
risk assessments,
Background
Risk perception in relation to pregnancy and birth is a
complex process based on multiple factors [ 1,2]. It is in-
fluenced by factors pertaining to risk perception beyond
the subject of childbirth and pregnancy-specific factors.
Factors involved in general risk perception include the
degree of perceived control involved in undertaking the
risk activity, the ways in which information about therisk is presented, and the degree of trust placed in the
source of the information [ 3–5]. Factors specific to preg-
nant women include the extent to which women view
childbirth as benefitting from medical management, and
common concerns for the wellbeing of their babies [ 6,7].
The two main discourses within which childbirth can
be understood also each have different approaches to
risk. The biomedical model regards birth as inherently
risky [ 8], whereas the social model regards pregnancy
risk as a concept constructed from multiple cultural and
personal factors [ 9]. Risk in the biomedical model is
generally presented in terms of potential physiological

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-019-2467-4outcomes whereas the social model recognises a more
holistic definition encompassing potential threats to
psychological and social wellbeing. In line with these
discourses, views of maternity healthcare professionals
have often been presented in a polarised fashion: typically
doctors are presented as supporting the medical model
and midwives the social model [ 10,11]. Doctors ’educa-
tion has frequently focussed on birth as a biomechanical
process whereas midwives may consider it in more holistic
terms [ 12,13]. However, presenting these approaches as
entrenched opposites oversimplifies the issue [ 14]. Such
dichotomous depictions overlook the fact all healthcare
professionals are likely to be aiming to provide high qual-
ity healthcare and ensure positive outcomes [ 15] and may
well move along the spectrum between approaches [ 16].
Accounts of risk perception should also consider women ’s
perspectives. In contempor ary Western culture, women ’s
understanding of birth has typically been portrayed as more
subjective and less well-informed than that of professionals
[17]. However, women ’s perception of risk often transcends
the medical and social models as they act from unique and
individual perspectives of their own circumstances [ 18]. The
portrayal of lay persons ’perceptions of risk in relation to
birth has also been simplified and polarised, with profes-
sional perceptions of risk oft en characterised as objective
and logical, and lay assessments as more emotion-based
[19]. Again, such dichotomous terms obscure and oversim-
plify the differences and similarities of risk perception
between lay and professional groups. Perception of risk by
members of both groups will en tail an assessment of numer-
ical odds but also be contingent on personal experience,
context and interactions with others [ 1].
However, research examining lay and medical risk per-
ception does find differences. A review of quantitative
risk perception research found little correlation between
perceptions held by healthcare professionals and of preg-
nant women with regard to pregnancy and childbirth
[20]. Qualitative research has similarly shown differences
in the way professionals and women define concepts of
risk and safety [ 21]. However, there is little research in
this area and existing studies have used different criteria
for assessing risk perception of professionals and women,
making them difficult to compare and reinforcing the idea
the groups assess risk in different ways.
The aim of this study is therefore to examine
pregnancy-related risk perception in women and mater-
nity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society using a unified assessment tool to enable direct
comparison, and to examine what women and profes-
sionals believe about each other ’s risk perception. This
study will contribute to the understanding of risk per-
ception and inform professionals seeking to understand
awareness of risk and improve communication with
pregnant women.Method
Design
We conducted a cross-sectional study of risk perception
in regard to pregnancy and childbirth by administering a
questionnaire (see Additional file 1) to doctors, midwives
and pregnant women.
Participants
A sample of pregnant women, midwives and doctors was
recruited from two NHS Trusts (organisations providing
state-funded healthcare and utilised by the majority of the
population) in South East England. Seventy-eight pregnant
women were approached and 68 (87%) completed ques-
tionnaires. Fifty-nine midwives completed the question-
naire (16% of those approached). Initial uptake of the
study was low among doctors ( n= 18, 20% of those
approached) so recruitment was extended for this group.
The final sample for analyses was 68 pregnant women, 59
midwives and 53 doctors. Doctors and midwives were
comparable in terms of time since qualification: doctors ’
mean time 14.8 years (SD = 10.23; range 1 to 37 years);
midwives mean time 12.71 years (SD = 9.9; range 1 month
to 34 years; t (109) = 1.09, p= .28). The midwives worked
in obstetric units and community settings; neither trust
involved in the study has a midwifery-led unit.
Inclusion criteria for healthcare professionals were a
recognised medical or midwifery qualification and cur-
rently working as a doctor or midwife in a UK maternity
service. This allowed for participation by junior doctors
not specialising in obstetrics but currently on an obstetric
placement. Pregnant women had to be between 18 and
21 weeks pregnant and aged 18 or over to participate.
Recruitment occurred between June 2016 and April
2017. Participants were initially recruited through two
NHS trusts in South East England. However, difficulties
recruiting doctors to the study meant it was necessary to
extend recruitment to include any doctor practising
obstetrics in the UK. These additional participants were
recruited via social media and completed the study
online.
Pregnant women were approached by a researcher
while waiting for their mid-pregnancy anomaly scan. All
women in the UK are offered this scan so this time was
chosen to reach the maximum number of women. They
were given verbal and written information about the
study and reassurance about confidentiality. If they
agreed to participate, they completed the questionnaire
straight away and returned it to the researcher. Informa-
tion about the study was placed in the maternity depart-
ments for doctors and midwives along with copies of the
questionnaire for them to complete at their convenience.
Researchers also visited the maternity units to provide
further information and approach staff in person. Con-
sent, agreed as part of the ethics approval for the study,Lee et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2019) 19:335 Page 2 of 8was considered indicated by completion of the question-
naire. All participants received information about the
study explaining the procedure.
Measures
The questionnaire consisted of two elements. The first
measured risk in relation to pregnancy and childbirth sce-
narios (80 items) and was adapted from the work of Gray
[22], a who used a similar scale to measure risk perception
in relation to hospitalisation in pregnancy. Each item in the
first element briefly described a pregnancy or birth sce-
nario, e.g. ‘a woman who has a minor postpartum haemor-
rhage at home ’,‘a woman giving birth in a birthpool in
hospital ’. Participants were asked to rate how much risk
they perceived each scenario represented to the wellbeing
of (i) the mother and (ii) the fetus/baby. Participants were
provided with a definition of risk as ‘ap o s s i b l ed e g r e eo f
threat to physical or psychological wellbeing ’.T h i sd e f i n -
ition was intended to allow participants to formulate their
own interpretations of scenarios as far as possible. Three
obstetricians, three midwives and six pregnant women
assisted in the development and piloting of the question-
naire to ensure user acceptability and face validity.
All participants received the same questionnaire but the
version for pregnant women also included definitions of
medical terms (e.g. shoulder dystocia, pre-eclampsia, etc.)
taken from the NHS Choices or Royal College of Obstetri-
cians and Gynaecologists websites. Participants indicated
the degree of risk perceived using a visual analogue scale:
a 100 mm line representing a continuum from ‘minimal
risk ’to‘extreme risk ’. The distance from the beginning of
the scale to participants ’marks was measured and the
resulting millimetre measurement became the risk score
for each question (minimum score = 0; maximum score =
100). Risks to mother and baby were scored separately,
providing total possible risk scores of 8000 for risk to
mother and 8000 for risk to baby (80 scenarios, maximum
score 100 per scenario).
The second element looked at participants ’comparison
of their own perceived risk with other groups (3 items).
Participants were asked to compare the extent to which
they believed others agreed with them about the degree of
risk generally involved in pregnancy and birth. A seven
point Likert scale was used ranging from (1) ‘they think it
is a lot less risky than I do ’to (7) ‘they think it is a lot
more risky than I do ’. A score of 4 therefore indicated they
believed the comparison group agreed with them about
the degree of risk. Participants first compared themselves
with members of their own group (other doctors, mid-
wives or pregnant women) and then with the remaining
two groups.
The primary outcomes were degree of perceived risk,
and perception of own sense of risk in comparison to
others in their own group and other groups.Sample size calculations based on the likelihood of
detecting a medium effect size estimated a sample of 53
doctors, 53 midwives and 53 pregnant women was needed
for the study to be adequately powered to find a difference
in the primary outcomes (power = 0.8, significance = .05).
Doctors and midwives were also asked how long they
had held their medical or midwifery qualification.
Analysis
Analysis was conducted using SPSS version 23 [ 23].
Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Levene ’s tests were conducted
to test for normal distribution and homogeneity of vari-
ance. ANOVA was used to test for differences in total
scores between groups. The data were found to be skewed
for scores on individual items so the non-parametric
Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test for differences between
the groups.
Results
Doctors ’, midwives ’and pregnant women ’s total mean
scores of overall perceived risk to the mother and baby
are shown in Table 1.
Overall mean risk scores were low to moderate for
mother and baby, ranging from 3127.64 –3776.94 from a
possible score of 8000. Doctors reported the lowest
mean scores. There were significant differences between
groups for risk to the mother but not for risk to the
baby. Post hoc tests revealed significant differences for
perceived risk to the mother between doctors and mid-
wives (mean difference 559.3, SE 211.05, p= .02) and
doctors and pregnant women (mean difference 524.13,
SE 208.01, p= .03) but not between midwives and preg-
nant women (mean difference 35.18. SE 183.64, p= .98).
Across individual risk scenarios however, there was little
agreement between the groups on the perceived degree of
risk (see Additional file 2). Regarding risk to the mother,
68 scenarios (85%) showed significant differences between
the groups ( p< .05) and only 12 (15%) showed no signifi-
cant differences in risk scores ( p=. 0 7 7 –.576). There was
also little agreement in scores on risk to the baby: 58 sce-
narios (73%) showed a significant difference between the
groups ( p< .05) and 22 scenarios (27%) showed no signifi-
cant differences ( p=. 0 5 1 –.724). Of the 12 scenarios which
showed no difference in risk scores for risk to the mother,
11 of these also showed no difference for risk to the baby.
In scenarios where there was a difference between risk
scores, doctors consistently rated the risk lowest. With
regards to risks to the mother, doctors rated the risks
lowest for the majority of scenarios where there was a
significant difference between groups (56 times out of
68). There was a similar picture with scores of risk to
the baby where doctors rated the risks lowest for the
majority of scenarios where there was a significant dif-
ference between groups (41 times out of 58). PregnantLee et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2019) 19:335 Page 3 of 8women rated the most scenarios the highest (mothers ’
risk 39 of 68; babies ’risk 30 of 58). Midwives rated
slightly fewer scenarios highest (mothers ’risk 32 of 68;
babies ’risk 28 of 58). Doctors ’ratings of risk were high-
est only once for mothers ’risk and once for babies ’risk.
However, although there was variation between groups
in the risk scores assigned to the mothers and babies in
the scenarios, there were similarities across the groups
when the scenarios were ranked in order of degree of
perceived risk. The 10 highest ranking scenarios are
shown in Table 2for risk to mothers and Table 3for
risk to babies. Six scenarios were consistently rated high-
est for risk to the mother by participants in all three
groups. Four scenarios were consistently rated highest
risk to the baby by participants in all three groups. Thus
while there was frequent disagreement about the degree
of risk posed in each scenario, there was more consensus
about the scenarios that posed the greatest risk to
mothers and babies.
Mean scores for participants ’estimations of how their
peers and members of the other groups would rate risk in
comparison to their own ratings are displayed in Table 4.
Each group believed their peers agreed with them about
the degree of risk generally involved in pregnancy and
childbirth. Doctors believed midwives perceived birth as a
little less risky than they did and pregnant women per-
ceived it as somewhat less risky. Midwives believed doc-
tors perceived pregnancy and birth as somewhat more
risky and pregnant women as a little less risky than they
did. Pregnant women believed doctors agreed with them
about the degree of risk involved in pregnancy and birth.
Their mean score for comparison with midwives fell
between midwives believing birth is a little less risky and
agreeing with the degree of risk.Discussion
This study aimed to examine risk perception in relation
to pregnancy and childbirth in pregnant women and ma-
ternity healthcare professionals in contemporary English
society, and to examine what pregnant women and pro-
fessionals believe about the risk perceptions of each
other. Results showed there were differences in risk per-
ception in relation to pregnancy and birth within and
between pregnant women, doctors and midwives. When
rating risk of different scenarios to mothers, there were
significant differences between pregnant women, doctors
and midwives for 68 out of 80 pregnancy-related scenar-
ios. This was less marked when rating risks for babies
where overall mean risk scores were not significantly dif-
ferent between groups, but there were differences in the
scores of 58 out of 80 scenarios. While assessments of
the degree of risk pertaining to scenarios differed, there
was more agreement on the ranking of scenarios accord-
ing to risk. Interestingly, when comparing their own rat-
ings of risk to others, each group incorrectly believed
their peers rated risk similarly to themselves. These
beliefs were not supported by the first part of the study.
The mean risk score for each group, and in particular
the doctors, had large standard deviations, indicating a
wide range of scores within groups (see Table 1). Each
group also believed doctors perceived most risk in preg-
nancy and birth. However, where there were significant
differences in scores for individual scenarios, where doc-
tors consistently rated the risks lower than women and
midwives.in The results of this study are consistent with
previous research showing pregnant women think about
risk differently to healthcare professionals. It showed
pregnant women had the highest risk perception scores.

wellbeing of their babies [ 24]. While this may appear
concerning, these fears are not necessarily perceived
negatively by women however and, though common, are
often not perceived as very intense or intrusive. They
may be viewed as an integral part of pregnancy which
confers an element of protection by motivating women
to speak out about their concerns [ 25]. Thus while
women acknowledge pregnancy and birth may involve a
degree of risk they also utilise psychological strategies to
manage these concerns and may tolerate greater degrees
of risk than professionals recommend, or would be pre-
pared to tolerate for themselves, if they believe doing so
will result in a better outcome for themselves and their
babies [ 26,27]. Within the professionals ’risk assess-
ments, midwives also rated risks to mothers significantly
higher than doctors. While midwifery care is based on
the assumption and promotion of normality in preg-
nancy, much midwifery activity is focussed on concerns
regarding the abnormal so creating a degree of tension
and disjunction between rhetoric and practice [ 28,29].
This study found differences between the risk percep-
tion of pregnant women and healthcare professionals. It
was beyond the scope of the study to investigate potential
reasons for these differences but they have traditionally
been attributed to women ’sm o r es u b j e c t i v e ,l e s s
knowledge-based understanding of risk [ 17,19]. However,
such a distinction may be misplaced; emotion, imagination
and intuition are components of all perceptions of risk
and so are likely to influence women and professionals
alike alongside an assessment of objective knowledge [ 30,
31]. Healthcare professionals have been shown to considerthe degree of the patient ’s anxiety, their own clinical ex-
perience, particularly that based on borderline or espe-
cially interesting cases and negative outcomes, and the
opinions of trusted colleagues when making decisions re-
garding risk [ 32,33]. They actively interpret evidence-
based guidelines according to their own and the patient ’s
individual circumstances rather than follow them abso-
lutely. Rather than differentiating between lay (subjective,
inferior) and professional (objective, authoritative) under-
standing of risk, it may be more appropriate to acknow-
ledge both groups rely on different types of understanding:
systematic, intuitive, exper iential and tacit, when making
judgements about risk [ 34]. Further research is needed to
establish how maternity professionals combine subjective
and objective elements of risk perception. It may also be
the case that doctors become habituated to situations in-
volving greater degrees of risk as they make up the majority
of their practice and utilise their obstetric skills.
The midwives and doctors in this study demonstrated
some differences in risk perception. Perceived differences
in approach to risk have been shown to be a factor which
can lead to tension between maternity care professionals
and feelings of lack of trust and support [ 35]. Such tension
maybe interpreted as conflict by service users and cause
them some anxiety [ 36]. The members of each group in
this study believed their peers agreed with them about the
degree of risk involved in pregnancy and childbirth,
although the results did not support this belief. In all com-
munication, individuals typically overestimate the extent
to which others share their beliefs and interpretation of
events [ 37]. This false consensus effect is particularly
evident in situations deemed important, in this instanceTable 3 Highest ranking scenarios for risk to baby

munication and conflict [ 38] so maternity care profes-
sionals should be aware of their potential influence in
communication with members of their own discipline as
well as others and pregnant women.
This study demonstrates risk perception in relation to
pregnancy and birth is a complex and individual process.
It challenges the stereotypical depictions of doctors and
midwives in regard to their perception of risk. This has
implications for how professionals perceive their own and
others ’roles, and how they communicate with each other
and with women in their care. Traditional distinctions
between the quality of professional and lay approaches to
risk oversimplify the process and may devalue women ’s
understanding of their circumstances and contribution to
their car [ 14]. Recognising all parties have a common goal
and speaking openly about factors influencing risk percep-
tion may enhance relationships with women and col-
leagues [ 39]. This in turn has been demonstrated to have
a positive effect on outcomes for women and babies [ 40].
This is the first study to explore the risk perception of
doctors, midwives and pregnant women using a compar-
able measure. It adds to the understanding of how the
different groups assess risk, their beliefs about the risk per-
ception of their peers and others, and has implications
regarding communication within and between groups. It
will contribute to the understanding of risk perception and
the conceptualisation of risk. It will increase knowledge of
risk perception in different groups and their beliefs about
each other, and challenge unhelpful stereotypes. It will
inform professionals working in maternity care and seeking
to understand awareness of risk and improve communica-
tion with pregnant women, an d provide information for
women utilising maternity care.
Strengths of this study include using the same mea-
sures for each group to allow direct comparisons of risk
perception across groups. The study was developed with
input from maternity service users, obstetricians and
midwives, ensuring its credibility and acceptability. The
sampling strategy ensured the inclusion of pregnant
women with different degrees and experiences of risk in
their own pregnancies and healthcare professionals
working in different areas of maternity care with varying
lengths of time qualified to provide a range of potential
perspectives on risk. A limitation of the study was the dif-
ficulty recruiting doctors and need to include participants
recruited online. The final sample therefore included doc-
tors from other areas so the group was potentially more
heterogeneous and self-selected than were the groups of
pregnant women and midwives. The relatively small num-
bers of doctors and midwives who ultimately participated
in the study mean further work is needed to establish how
representative their perceptions of risk are and the extent
to which the findings are generalisable. Although effortswere made to ensure face validity, the questionnaire has
not been formally validated so further work is needed to
establish the extent to which it accurately represents per-
ception of risk and the extent to which these perceptions
manifest in behaviour. Finally, between-group differences
were tested for all 80 individual scenarios and multiple
comparisons increase the probability that some of the
significant findings occurred by chance. It is therefore
important to replicate and extend this research.
Conclusions
Assessment of risk is a complex activity comprised of
objective and subjective elements. All individuals making
an assessment of risk will rely on these elements to dif-
fering extents depending on the particular context. Indi-
viduals cannot assume others share their perception of
risk or that they make correct assessments regarding the
risk perception of others.
Healthcare professionals should be aware of these con-
siderations when communicating with pregnant women,
and also with other professionals. Communication with
women should include sensitive and respectful exploration
of their understanding and perception of risk and safety,
and acknowledgement of any anxieties. When communi-
cating with members of their own discipline, professionals
should not make assumptions that colleagues will share
their perceptions. They should be mindful of the subject-
ivity of their own risk assessments and factors which may
influence their perceptions rather than attempting to elim-
inate or deny the effects of some of these influences. They
should challenge their own and others ’stereotypical
assumptions about the perception of risk in other disci-
plines, and ensure interdisciplinary communication is
based on professional respect and genuine understanding.
Further research is needed to consider what factors
professionals and pregnant women take into account
when making risk assessments in relation to pregnancy
and birth and how they use these factors to formulate
their assessments. It should also examine which ele-
ments of pregnancy and birth are perceived as most
risky, what it is about them which causes concern, and
the extent to which evidence exists to support these
perceptions. Qualitative research should explore health-
care professionals ’and pregnant women ’s understanding
and awareness of their perceptions of risk. Research is
needed to establish how perception of risk influences
professionals ’communication with women, the barriers
to effective risk communication, and how this communi-
cation can be improved. Research into interprofessional
working should explore how stereotypical expectations
about the risk perception of other groups arise, can
be challenged, and communication between disciplines
improved.Lee et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2019) 19:335 Page 6 of 8Additional files

Migraine, pregnancy
Received 25 October 2017; accepted 1 March 2018
Migraine is estimated to affect 959m people worldwide. In women of
childbearing age, the prevalence is highest at 24%.1It has a female
preponderance of 3:1. This is thought to be due to the inﬂuence of
female hormones as before puberty, both sexes are affected equally.
Pathophysiology of migraine
Functional imaging studies have provided evidence that there is
disordered sensory processing in migraine with key involvement of
deep brain structures; thalamus, hypothalamus and brainstem.3,4
The current thinking is that there is activation of the trigemino-
vascular system with efferent ﬁbres to the dura mater and cranial
blood vessels, and the afferent projections from these structures tothe trigeminocervical complex (TCC) at the cervicomedul-
lary junction.

Trigeminal sensory nerve ﬁbres contain neuropeptides including
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). This has also been found in
the brainstem. In humans, CGRP has been shown to be elevated
during the headache phase of migraine and levels normalise following
triptans.6

migraine has been reported in large studies to improve by the end

increase in endogenous endorphins. There may be an exacerbation of
symptoms in the ﬁrst trimester, partly due to lifestyle changesincluding missing meals due to nausea or vomiting of morning sick-

trogen levels rise. Unfortunately, some women do not notice a beneﬁt

Abstract
The prevalence of migraine in women of childbearing age is high, estimated at 24%. Migraine management during pregnancy and lactation can be
challenging. Our understanding of the way in which medications affect the unborn fetus is still incomplete and the evidence is constantly changing wi th
more recent emphasis on longitudinal studies and childhood development. The aim of this article is to describe the relationship between migraine and
pregnancy and review the current evidence on treatment options in pregnancy and lactation.

journals.sagepub.com/home/obminfarction in pregnancy, although this relied on discharge coding and
used International classiﬁcation of diseases-9 (ICD-9) coding for
migraine and excluded tension-type headache diagnosis on discharge.
Since only 0.185% of their pregnant women were coded as havingmigraine it is likely that the coding is not sufﬁcient to capturemigraine.
15A subsequent systematic literature review by Wabnitz
and Bushnell et al. supported this association but included the
above-referenced paper. Given the limitations described further stud-
ies are required to corroborate this link.16
Banhidy et al. reported an increased risk of limb deformities in
migraineurs.17However, this study was limited by a number of fac-
tors; the diagnosis of migraine was based on retrospective question-
naires and perhaps due to this the prevalence of migraine was 2–3%in their study population with a similar number having ‘other head-ache’. This is likely to be a signiﬁcant underestimate. Also, maternal
drug use was not adequately excluded as a confounder. More rigor-
ous studies are needed to support this association.
Management during pregnancy
The management of women with migraine should include preconcep-
tion counselling particularly if migraine preventatives are used as
some, such as valproate and topiramate, may have to be stopped.
It is important to manage migraine optimally during pregnancy as
there can be deleterious effects on the health of both mother and fetus
as a result of prolonged vomiting or nutritional issues. Advice on
avoiding triggers, for example, keeping a regular sleep pattern andnot missing meals is important. There is also a role for behavioural
interventions such as relaxation, biofeedback and stress management.18
The decision to use medications during pregnancy will involve a
discussion about the risk beneﬁt ratio and patients must be providedwith information allowing them to make an informed choice. It isimportant to aim for the lowest effective dose and frequency. As preg-
nant women are excluded from drug trials, there is a reliance upon
observational and retrospective data with regards to teratogenicity.The current evidence regarding migraine medications will be discussed.
Acute treatments
Paracetamol
Paracetamol has long been considered safe in pregnancy. There have
some recent suggestions of hyperactivity and behavioural disorderslinked to long-term paracetamol use during pregnancy.
19However,
the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewedthese and concluded that current evidence is insufﬁcient to sup-
port this.
20
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories
Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatories (NSAIDS) are often the ﬁrst line
of treatment in migraine. There have been concerns raised aboutpossible increased risks of miscarriage,
21although a large, historical
cohort study did not support this association22with the exception of
indomethacin. After 32 weeks, NSAIDs have been linked with

sion. A prospective cohort study looked at four NSAIDs, ibuprofen,diclofenac, naproxen and piroxicam, in 6511 pregnant women.
23
Ibuprofen and diclofenac in the second trimester were associatedwith low birth weight (OR 1.7 and 3.1, respectively), although thismay be confounded by the underlying inﬂammatory disorders for
which the patients were being treated. Second and third trimester
use of ibuprofen was associated with an OR of 1.5 of asthma in18-month olds. Third trimester diclofenac was also associated withmaternal vaginal bleeding. Reassuringly, the study found no associ-ation with congenital malformations. It is reasonable to use ibupro-fen or naproxen in the second and early third trimesters and there isno clear consensus on ﬁrst trimester use.
Aspirin appears to be safe at low dose ( <100 mg). Higher doses
should be avoided in the third trimester due to risk of postpartumand neonatal bleeding as well as premature ductus arteriosus closure.
Naproxen 500 mg with a prokinetic anti-emetic such as metoclo-
pramide can be an effective combination to give acutely.
Triptans
The triptans are 5-HT 1B/D agonists which are speciﬁc abortiveagents in migraine (and cluster headache). Sumatriptan was theﬁrst and most commonly used although there are now several differ-ent triptans on the market.
There have been relatively large numbers of pregnant women
exposed to triptans with data from pregnancy registries inScandinavia contributing for the most part. The Norwegian Motherand Child Cohort Study was an observational, prospective study col-lecting data on 69,929 pregnant women, 1535 of whom were usingtriptans.
24Sumatriptan was used by 47% of the triptan users in the
ﬁrst trimester; rizatriptan by 23.6%, zolmitriptan by 17.5% andeletriptan by 12.9%. No signiﬁcant associations between triptan ther-
apy during the ﬁrst trimester and major congenital malformations were
found but a slight increase in the risk of atonic uterus and haemorrhage
was associated with triptan use during the second and/or third trimes-
ters. A larger Swedish study used the national pregnancy register and
medical birth register, and looked at 2777 pregnant women exposed totriptans, the majority on sumatriptan.
25It again showed no evidence of
teratogenicity. Unlike the Norwegian study, there was no increased
risk for bleeding around delivery. A meta-analysis of 4208 exposed
infants conﬁrms the lack of evidence for teratogenicity but included
two small studies ( n¼96,n¼82) which suggested an increased risk of
spontaneous abortion.26This increased risk was not found to be sig-
niﬁcant in the triptan-exposed group versus the migraine no-triptans
group but was signiﬁcant when comparing triptan-exposed to non-
migraineurs. A subsequent prospective study of 432 women exposed
to triptans does not corroborate this association.27
A proportion of those from the Norwegian cohort completed
validated questionnaires about their child at 18 months and36 months and on the basis of these, it has been suggested that pre-
natal triptan use may be associated with externalizing behaviour
problems (1.36-fold risk).
28There are a number of possible confound-
ers including severity of migraine and these ﬁndings should be inter-
preted with caution. Further studies are needed in this area.
If simple analgesics have failed, it is reasonable to prescribe suma-
triptan following an informative consultation with the patient.
Ergotamines are used less often these days and are avoided during
pregnancy due to potential vasoconstrictive and uterotonic effects.
A recent observational study did not ﬁnd any increase in congenital
malformations but there was an increase in pre-term births.25
Opioids
The use of opioids in migraine, in general, is discouraged due to riskof dependence and the availability of better drugs.
29Prolonged use in
pregnancy is associated with neonatal withdrawal, growth retarda-
tion and respiratory depression late in pregnancy. Occasional use
of weaker opioids such as codeine is reasonable if other drugs
have failed.
Antiemetics
The dopamine antagonists, metoclopramide and domperidone areuseful in migraine due to their prokinetic effect aiding absorption
of oral medications as well their anti-emetic effect. Metoclopramideis often used in pregnancy for hyperemesis and is generally thought to
be safe,
30although there is a risk of dyskinesia. Domperidone is less
likely to cause central effects such as dystonic reactions or sedation as
it doesn’t readily cross the blood-brain barrier but it has been rarely
linked to prolonged QT on electrocardiogram and there are less dataon safety in pregnancy.
31Prochloperazine may be associated with
neonatal withdrawal during third trimester use, although it is com-
monly used in clinical practice.32Table 1. International Headache Society criteria for migraine.2

This is a peripheral block to the greater occipital nerve (GON) and is
administered in headache centres for the temporary relief of primaryheadache disorders such as migraine.
33It can be used to manage an
acute, prolonged migraine episode as well as for chronic migraine.Cervical afferents from the GON synapse on second-order neurons inthe TCC (see Figure 1). The lidocaine component of the GON isrelatively safe. A steroid component, such as depomedrone, is often
added to this peripheral block. A retrospective study of pregnant
women receiving lidocaine or bupivicaine nerve blocks suggestedthat this could be an effective and safe treatment, although thestudy included only 13 patients.
34
Preventative treatment
Women with more frequent or severe migraine may require treatmentwith migraine preventatives but these are generally initiated under theguidance of a neurologist and so will not be covered in detail. Ideallypreventatives should be avoided, but if required beta-blockers, suchas propranolol, are the ﬁrst-line option and can be continued duringbreastfeeding. There are theoretical concerns about the use of beta-blockers in the third trimester and the development of neonatal bra-dycardia, hypoglycaemia or respiratory depression in the neonate.However, these are used in many women for a variety of indications
and the majority do not experience any neonatal complications.
Amitriptyline or nortriptyline are the second-line options with poten-tial neonatal withdrawal symptoms when used late in the third tri-mester.
35Topiramate, valproate and candesartan are
contraindicated. A case report of Onabotulinumtoxin A injectionsfor migraine from week 18 was published with no apparent adverseeffects.
36It is not generally used in clinical practice during pregnancy
due to potential toxicity, although there is no clear evidence of tera-togenicity. Although there is no evidence that melatonin is harmful inpregnancy, it is not recommended due to the lack of safety data.Acupuncture is thought to be safe.
Dietary supplements
Certain dietary supplements may have a beneﬁcial effect in migrainealthough in comparison to pharmacological treatments, the evidenceis less robust. Data in pregnancy are even more sparse than withpharmaceutical drugs, however.
Magnesium has long been used in pregnancy for other indications
and considered safe, although recently intravenous magnesium sul-
phate exposure has been shown to be associated with fetal boneabnormalities.
37It is not clear whether these effects occur following
long-term oral magnesium supplementation at doses required formigraine prophylaxis.
Although riboﬂavin is safe in pregnancy at the recommended
daily dose, there are no safety data in pregnancy on high doses(400 mg) required for migraine prophylaxis. Coenzyme Q may be a
potential option as it has been used in preeclampsia from week 20 but
other than this there is very little safety data.
38Feverfew and butter-
bur are not recommended in pregnancy.
Breast feeding
Since over half of women experience a recurrence of migraine withinthe ﬁrst post-partum month, breastfeeding mothers are likely torequire some medication. As with pregnancy, recommendations onthe use of drugs in lactation also largely rely on case reports andobservational data. There are directories available such as the Halemanual.
39The degree of safety of drugs is linked to the transfer into
breast milk with an infant dose of less than 10% of the maternalconsidered to be relatively safe. Methods to reduce infant exposure
include expressing milk, alternating between breast and bottle feedand altering the timing of feed to avoid peak levels in breast milk. Theability of the infant to metabolise drugs also depends on age withthose less than one-month old most at risk and a better metabolism ofdrugs above seven months of age.
40
With regards to acute medications, paracetamol and ibuprofen
are the safest (Table 2). Available data suggest some of the otherNSAIDS such as diclofenac do not pose a signiﬁcant risk. Aspirin,however, should only be used with caution due to an association withReye’s syndrome in infants. Among the triptans, eletriptan has beendemonstrated to have minimal transfer with 0.02% of the dose pre-sent although this was at 24 h.
41Oral sumatriptan has poor bioavail-
ability and it thought to be safe with an estimated 0.03% of thematernal dose. Subcutaneous sumatriptan reaches peak dose at 2.5h with 3.5% relative infant dose.
42Expressing and discarding milk for
8 h post subcutaneous injection would avoid any exposure but it islikely to be unnecessary unless the infant is pre-term.
Ergotamines are generally avoided. Codeine has been associated
with infant apnoea and sedation in higher doses.
Anti-emetics such as metoclopramide and domperidone may
increase prolactin and lactation, although domperidone has lowerconcentrations in milk.
43Domperidone has, in fact, been given to
breastfeeding mothers to increase lactation and is thought to besafe at doses of 30 mg per day or less. European Medicines Agencyguidance recommends that it should be used at the lowest effectivedose for the shortest possible duration with a maximum treatmentduration of no more than one week due to the risk of cardiacarrhythmia.
44
Occasional use of prochlorperazine is thought to be compatible
with breastfeeding, although there is a risk of sedation and apnoea inyounger infants.
45
Current evidence suggests that it is reasonable to use these drugs
with the relevant cautions noted in the text.
Novel treatments
There are a number of non-invasive neurostimulation devices avail-able for the treatment of migraine including transcranial magneticstimulation (TMS), vagal nerve stimulators and transcutaneoussupraorbital nerve stimulators. These devices are placed on thehead or neck and emit electrical signals to the nerve or magneticpulses, in the case of TMS, to the occipital cortex. The mechanismof action has not been clearly established but they have been used toabort an attack and also as prophylaxis. The safety of non-invasivestimulation devices has not been determined in pregnancy. Data arelimited but there have been case reports of three pregnant womentreated with TMS with no complications documented
46and anecdot-
al use of the other devices. These devices may offer a suitable alter-native to drugs in the future, although further data are needed toestablish safety.
There are some exciting developments in the world of migraine.
As mentioned earlier, CGRP is expressed peripherally and centrallyin migraine. CGRP antagonists have been developed and are likely tobe used acutely to abort attacks as an alternative to triptans sincethey lack the vasoconstrictor effect of triptans. CGRP monoclonalantibodies have been shown to be effective as prophylactics.
6,47,48
Other drugs, including 5HT-1F receptor agonists which also lackthe vasoconstrictor effects of triptans, are likely to become availablein the near future, making them suitable for use in patients withcardiovascular conditions.
49The suitability of these new drugs for
pregnant migraineurs is unlikely to be known until these drugshave become well-established.
Our understanding of the way in which medications affect the
unborn fetus is still incomplete and the evidence is constantlyAfridi 157changing with more recent emphasis on longitudinal studies and
childhood development. The therapeutic landscape of migraine con-
tinues to evolve bringing with it the potential for better treatments for
pregnant women in the future.

Background: Current reference ranges for blood pressure and heart rate throughout pregnancy have a poor
evidence base.
Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis. We included studies measuring blood pressure or heart
rate from healthy pregnant women within defined gestational periods of 16 weeks or less. We analysed systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate by gestational age. We assessed effects of measurement
year and method.
Results: We included 39 studies undertaken in 1967 –2017, containing 124,349 systolic measurements from 36,239
women, 124,291 diastolic measurements from 36,181 women and 10,948 heart rate measurements from 8317
women. Mean (95% CI) systolic blood pressure was lowest at 10 weeks gestation, 110.4 (108.5, 112.3) mmHg, rising
to 116.0 (113.6, 118.4) mmHg at 40 weeks, mean (95% CI) change 5.6 (4.0, 7.2) mmHg. Mean (95% CI) diastolic blood
pressure was lowest at 21 weeks gestation, 65.9 (64.2, 67.7) mmHg; rising to 72.8 (71.0, 74.6) mmHg at 40 weeks,
mean (95% CI) change 6.9 (6.2, 7.5) mmHg. Mean (95% CI) heart rate rose from 79.3 (75.5, 83.1) beats/min at 10
weeks to 86.9 (82.2, 91.6) beats/min at 40 weeks gestation, mean (95% CI) change 7.6 (1.8, 13.4) beats/min. Studies
using manual measurement reported higher diastolic blood pressures than studies using automated measurement,
mean (95 CI) difference 4.9 (0.8, 8.9) mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure increased by 0.26 (95% CI 0.10 –0.43) mmHg/
year. Including only higher-quality studies had little effect on findings, with heterogeneity remaining high ( I2
statistic > 50%).
Conclusions: Significant gestational blood pressure and heart rate changes occur that should be taken into account
when assessing pregnant women. Commonly taught substantial decreases in blood pressure mid-pregnancy
w e r en o ts e e na n dh e a r tr a t ei n c r e a s e sw e r el o w e rt h a n previously thought. Manual and automated blood
pressure measurement cannot be used i nterchangeably. Increases in dias tolic blood pressure over the last
half-century and differences between published stu dies show contemporary data are required to define
current normal ranges.

https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-019-1399-1Background
Heart rate and blood pressure are key vital signs for the
assessment of pregnant women [ 1,2]. Our understand-
ing of the normal thresholds for these vital signs under-
pins their use. Many modern clinical guidelines do not
reference the sources of their normal vital sign ranges
[3–5]. Others refer to an obstetric physiology textbook,
which references data from small individual studies pub-
lished between 1970 and the mid-1990s [ 6]. Core
textbooks commonly suggest a mid-pregnancy dip of
around 5 mmHg for systolic and 10 –15 mmHg for dia-
stolic blood pressure along with a progressive rise in
heart rate ranging from 10 to 20 beats/min [ 7–9]. Where
referenced, these texts rely on the same physiology text-
book [ 6] or small individual studies from over 30 years
ago [ 10]. The changes in vital signs that occur in preg-
nancy are known to complicate the recognition of
deterioration [ 11]. However, we could not identify a clin-
ical guideline or Modified Early Obstetric Warning
Score (MEOWS) [ 2] that took account of expected ges-
tational changes in vital sign physiology. MEOWS use
the perceived normal thresholds to determine whether a
woman requires review. However, the thresholds used
are based on clinical consensus [ 4,12]. Small changes
in thresholds make substantial differences to the abil-
ity of clinical scores to identify physiological deterior-
ation [ 13,14]. Evidence-based normal values that take
into account changes during pregnancy are therefore
required. We carried out a systematic review and
meta-analysis to establish whether gestation-specific
normal ranges for heart rate and systolic and diastolic
blood pressure can be produced from available studies
of participants that were “healthy ”at recruitment. We
planned to investigate the effects of year of measure-
ment, method of measurement (for blood pressure)
and parity on vital signs.
Methods
This systematic review follows the Meta-analysis Of Obser-
vational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) [ 15]a n d
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [ 16] guidelines (Additional file 1).
We registered the review (PROSPERO: CRD42014009673)
and published the protocol [ 17].
We included cross-sectional, case-control or longitudinal
studies containing at least fif ty participants and where mea-
surements were taken by a healthcare professional.
We included studies containing blood pressure or
heart rate measurements from pregnant women re-
cruited as “healthy ”. We defined “healthy ”as women not
known to have conditions likely to affect blood pressure
or heart rate at the point of first measurement, accord-
ing to inclusion and exclusion criteria described in
Table 1. We included studies where participantsrecruited as healthy subsequently developed conditions
potentially affecting blood pressure or heart rate. In
studies where these participants ’data were presented
separately, we extracted vital sign measurements for
both groups. We excluded data where an intervention
potentially affecting these vital signs was studied. We in-
cluded baseline measurements prior to an intervention.
We excluded data from subgroups selected at recruit-
ment on the basis of characteristics or medical diagnoses
(Additional file 2: List S1); we extracted data from con-
trol groups of “healthy ”pregnant women in these stud-
ies. We excluded studies where the gestational age at
which measurements were taken was not defined to 16
weeks or less.
We set out to include measurements of all six vital
signs recommended for clinical assessment (systolic
blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, oxy-
gen saturation, respiratory rate and/or temperature),
made antepartum, intrapartum or postpartum [ 17]. We
have restricted this report to blood pressure and heart
rate data measured in the antepartum period, as we
found little data for other vital signs or time periods.
Search strategy
With a trained librarian, we searched MEDLINE,
Embase and CINAHL, from inception until February
2018. We also searched reference lists and contacted
field experts. Where required data were not presented
or were presented in a form we could not extract, we
contacted the original authors by e-mail. We used
both MeSH and free-text terms. We did not restrict
the year or language of publication. The complete
search strategy has been described previously [ 17].
Additional file 2: Table S1 details the MEDLINE
search strategy.
Two reviewers (LL and RP) independently screened re-
trieved titles and abstracts to exclude studies that clearly
fell outside the scope of the review, such as foetal or ani-
mal studies. Two reviewers (PW and LM) independently
screened the remaining studies by title, then by abstract
and finally by full text against the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria (Table 1). Where reviewers disagreed, the
study proceeded to the next screening stage.
Data extraction
Two reviewers (LL and RP) independently extracted
study data onto a piloted spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel).
Disagreements were automatically highlighted and re-
solved by recourse to the original papers or in consult-
ation with a medical statistician (JB), intensive care
specialist (PW) or obstetric physician (LM), as required.
For each study, we extracted information about the
study (year of data collection and publication, study set-
ting, country of study, data collection schedule),Loerup et al. BMC Medicine          (2019) 17:167 Page 2 of 12measurements (method, subject position, details of
measurement device) and participants (age, weight, body
mass index (BMI), ethnicity, reason for measurements,
parity, number of gestations, pregnancy dating method).
For each period of pregnancy defined in a paper, we ex-
tracted information about the sample size and minimum
and maximum gestational age, together with reported
summary statistics for blood pressure and heart rate. We
used Engauge Digitizer, https://sourceforge.net/projects/
digitizer/works (open source software) to extract data
from graphs if the underlying data were not presented
and we could not obtain it from the authors.
Assessment of bias
Two reviewers (LL and RP) independently undertook
quality assessment in line with QUADAS (Quality Assess-
ment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies)-2 [ 18], adapted
from the methodology of Ioannou et al. [ 19] following
pre-determined rules (Additional file 2: Table S2). We
assessed studies over two domains: study design and
reporting methods. We scored statistical methods within
these two domains, taking account of differing study de-
signs. Each methodological criterion was scored as either
“high”or“low”risk of bias. For each of the two domains,
the overall quality score for each study was defined as the
percentage of “low risk of bias ”marks over the total num-
ber of criteria. We assessed the effects of only includingstudies scoring 50% or more on mean estimates of heart
rate and blood pressure and on heterogeneity between
studies.
Summary measures
Principal summary statistics were mean and standard
deviation for each measure of heart rate and blood
pressure, along with sample size. Where mean and
standard deviation for blood pressure and heart rate
were not reported, we approximated these assuming a
normal distribution (with no skewness), in line with
previous descriptions of vital sign measurement distri-
butions [ 20]. Where multiple measurements were
reported on the same day for the same participants
(e.g. blood pressure measured in the sitting and lying
positions), we selected a single data point using pre-
specified rules [ 17]. We assigned the development
status of a study country using the Human Develop-
ment Index (2015) [ 21].
Where the gestational age associated with each data
point was reported as a mean or median gestational age,
we used this for the analysis. Where the gestational age
associated with each data point was reported as a range,
we used the mid-point of the range. Gestational age
measured using ultrasound measurement of the foetal
crown-rump length before 14 weeks gestation was our
preferred assessment method [ 22].Table 1 Inclusion and exclusion criteria

‡List of characteristics or diagnoses leading to exclusion are shown in Additional file 2: List S1Loerup et al. BMC Medicine          (2019) 17:167 Page 3 of 12Where the sample size associated with each data point
was reported, we used this for the analysis. For studies
where the sample size was reported only at baseline, we
took the sample size associated with each data point to
be the baseline sample size, assuming no dropouts or
loss-to-follow-up.
Where characteristics of women (weight, BMI, age,
parity) were reported at multiple time points (e.g. pre-
pregnancy, at recruitment and/or at delivery), we used
the value closest to recruitment. Where the mean values
of the characteristics of the sample of women associated
with each data point were reported, we used this for
analysis. For studies where the characteristics of women
were only reported for the entire sample of women re-
cruited, and not for the sample at each time point, we
used entire sample values, assuming no dropouts or loss
to follow-up. Where only median values were reported,
we used these instead of the mean values, assuming nor-
mal distributions of characteristics (with no skewness).
The study year was taken to be the last year of recruit-
ment to the study or the year of publication where this
was not reported.
Synthesis of results
To analyse trajectories of changes in blood pressure and
heart rate, we adapted the method for meta-analysis of
longitudinal studies proposed by Ishak et al. [ 23,24]
Ishak conducted a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies
reporting data at a series of fixed time points, using
study summary statistics. Linear mixed effects models
were used to take account of correlations in longitudinal
data. We adapted Ishak ’s general multivariate model to
conduct a meta-analysis of studies which report data at
different time points, whilst still accounting for correla-
tions between data points within studies and between
studies (our “longitudinal model ”). The time points in
our analysis are the different values of gestational age.
All data points from an individual study were included.
We used a random coefficients model that allows for an
arithmetic description of the relationship between the
measurement of interest and gestational age [ 25]. The
models were built up based on polynomials of gesta-
tional age by adding higher order polynomials, first as
fixed effects, and then as random coefficients. Decisions
on which terms to include were based on AIC and BIC
(Akaike and Bayesian Information Criterion) —measures
of assessing model fit whilst accounting for the number
of parameters [ 26,27]. To assess the additional benefit
of higher order fixed effects terms, we fitted models
based on maximum likelihood (ML) estimation; whereas
to assess the benefit of higher-order random effect
terms, and to fit the final model, we undertook restricted
maximum likelihood estimation (REML). Each observa-
tion was weighted according to the study reportedstandard error. To account for the correlation of obser-
vations within a study, a spatial power covariance struc-
ture was used, which allows for the irregular nature of
time between measurements [ 28].
We undertook pre-specified secondary analyses to inves-
tigate the effects of method of measurement (manual vs.
automated), year of data collec tion and parity on systolic
and diastolic blood pressure. We added these covariates to
the model as fixed effects. We added method of measure-
ment and year of measurement simultaneously as we ex-
pected them to be related. To assess the effect of parity,
where possible, we separated data into nulliparous and
multiparous groups. Otherwis e, we entered parity into the
model as the proportion of multiparous mothers. We did
not undertake secondary analyses of heart rate, as the lim-
ited study numbers would h ave resulted in imprecise
results.
Additionally, we pooled data for each trimester from
each included study in a random effects analysis to gen-
erate Forest plots for each vital sign. Trimesters were
defined as trimester 1 from 0+0to 12+6weeks; trimester
2 from 13+0to 25+6weeks; trimester 3 from 26+0to
36+6weeks and full term from 37+0weeks to delivery
[29]. Where data were reported for subgroups within a
single study, for example for nulliparous and multipar-
ous women, a weighted mean and standard error of the
mean were calculated. Where more than two data points
for a single trimester within a study were reported, the
same women would be included in both data points, so
the mean of the data points was calculated. The standard
error of the mean was calculated assuming a correlation
between measurements on the same patient of 0.7. This
was considered reasonable considering how close in time
the measurements were. The weighted mean of the ges-
tational age for the data points was calculated.
We estimated the pooled weighted mean and 95%
confidence intervals where the weight of an individual
study was inversely proportional to the sum of the
variance (SE2) of the study mean and the between-
study variance. To estimate the spread of vital sign
data in an individual study setting, we computed 95%
prediction intervals from the random effects analysis,
according to the methodology presented by Riley et
al. [ 30] We determined heterogeneity using the I2
s t a t i s t i c( r a n g e0 –100%).
We performed a pre-specified sensitivity analysis ex-
cluding outlying studies (with means lying outside of the
predictive interval). We also performed an additional
sensitivity analysis excluding studies scoring less than
50% on quality assessment.
As the studies included in the review did not have a
comparative design, we could not assess publication bias.
However, selective reporting was assessed as part of the
quality assessment.Loerup et al. BMC Medicine          (2019) 17:167 Page 4 of 12Statistical analyses were undertaken using StataCorp.

Results
Database screening identified 1897 publications. We identi-
fied a further 14 publications from reference lists or expert
knowledge. We included 39 studies from 20 countries
meeting our pre-specified criteria, Fig. 1. Detailed reasons
for exclusion are shown in Additional file 2:T a b l eS 3 .
The included studies are summarised in Additional file 2:
Table S4. We extracted blood pressure data from 34 stud-
ies. We extracted heart rate data from 13 studies. Studies
came from 20 different countries, 17 high-developmentcountries and three middle- or low-development countries.
One (Russian) study was not reported in English [ 31].
We included 394 summary measurements of blood
pressure, representing 124, 349 systolic measurements
from 36,239 women and 124,291 diastolic measure-
ments from 36,181 women. The 23 longitudinal stud-
ies reported measurements of blood pressure from 33
separate groups of women [ 32–54]. Longitudinal stud-
ies varied in the number of time points at which a
group had blood pressure measured (median 4 time
points, range 2 to 35). A further 11 studies reported
cross-sectional measurements [ 31,55–64]. Two of
these studies reported mult iple cross-sectional mea-
surements [ 56,61]. The remaining studies reported mea-
surements at a single time. A manual sphygmomanometer

53,57,58,62,64]. An automated blood pressure monitor
was used in thirteen studies [ 32,33,42,43,48,50–52,54–
56,59,61]. Six studies did not report the measurement
methodology [ 31,36,40,46,60,63].
We included 34 summary measurements of heart
rate, representing 10,948 heart rate measurements
from 8317 women. The five longitudinal studies re-
ported measurements from seven separate groups of
women [ 32,42,48,65,66]. Summary measurements
were reported at between 3 and 8 (median 4) time
points per group. A further eight studies reported
cross-sectional measurements of heart rate at a single
time point [ 31,57,59,63,64,67–69]. The method of
heart rate measurement was reported as electrocardiog-
raphy (ECG; 5 studies, 8 time points) [ 57,64,66–68],
echocardiography (echo; 1 study, 2 time points) [ 69], fin-
ger arterial pressure sensor (1 study, 4 time points) [ 48],
radioulnar pulse wave monitoring (1 study, 8 time points)
[65], reading from an automated blood pressure (BP)
monitor (2 studies, 4 time points) [ 42,59] or not specified
(3 studies, 16 time points) [ 31,32,63].
Quality assessment scores ranged from 5.6 to
84.2% (median 44.4%, where 100% is a good score).
Additional file 2: Figure S1 summarises the score per
assessment criterion. Individual paper scores are
shown in Additional file 2: Table S4. Common rea-
sons for scoring poorly incl uded not sufficiently de-
fining the population und er study (28 studies), not
defining gestational age using ultrasound measure-
ment of crown-rump length before 14 weeks (26
studies) and not describing/using measurement de-
vices ratified for use in pr egnancy (30 studies). Of
the 13 studies that used automated methods of blood
pressure measurement, three stated that they used ma-
chines validated for use in pregnancy [ 42,48,59]. Five
studies reported that the measurement device was cali-
brated prior to the study taking place (all manual sphyg-
momanometer methods) [ 37,39,44,62,64]. The method
of blood pressure measurement was not specified in six
studies [ 31,35,36,40,46,69]. Use of an appropriately
sized BP cuff was reported in 13 studies [ 33,37,38,42–
45,47,49,54,58,61,62].
Both systolic and diastolic blood pressure changed sig-
nificantly across pregnancy (for combined manual and
automatic readings) when modelled using our longitu-
dinal model (Fig. 2). Systolic blood pressure was lowest
at 10 weeks gestation, mean (95% confidence intervals,
CI) 110.4 (108.5, 112.3) mmHg, rising to 116.0 (113.6,
118.4) mmHg at 40 weeks gestation; a change of 5.6
(95% CI 4.0, 7.2) mmHg from 10 to 40 weeks ( p< 0.001).
Mean (95% CI) diastolic blood pressure was 67.1 (65.4,
68.7) mmHg at 10 weeks gestation. Mean (95% CI) dia-
stolic blood pressure was lowest at 21 weeks 65.9 (64.2,67.7) mmHg, rising to 72.8 (71.0, 74.6) mmHg at 40
weeks; a change of 6.9 (95% CI 6.2, 7.5) mmHg from 21
to 40 weeks ( p< 0.001). Mean (95% CI) heart rate rose
from 79.3 (75.5, 83.1) beats/min at 10 weeks to 86.9
(82.2, 91.6) beats/min at 40 weeks; a change of 7.6 (1.8,
13.4) beats/min from 10 to 40 weeks ( p= 0.014), Fig. 3.
Though all longitudinal studies showed heart rate to in-
crease across pregnancy, three relatively small studies
showed a small drop in heart rate at the end of preg-
nancy [ 32,48,65].
Forest plots of systolic, diastolic and heart rate data
(one plot per trimester) are shown (Additional file 2:
Figure S2). Significant heterogeneity was present for all
measures in all trimesters. Blood pressure and heart rate
mean trimester estimates were similar whether estimated
using our longitudinal model or random effects meta-
analyses (Additional file 2: Table S5).
Subgroup analyses
Studies that used a manual measurement reported higher
mean diastolic blood pressures than studies using an auto-
mated technique, difference (95% CI) in mean intercept of
4.9 (0.8, 8.9) mmHg ( p= 0.020). Mean manual systolic
blood pressure measurements did not differ from those in
studies that used an automated measurement, difference
(95% CI) in mean intercept of 2.8 ( −2.3, 7.9), p=0 . 2 7 4
(Additional file 2: Figure S3).
Studies of automated measures commenced in 2002
becoming more common over time. We therefore ana-
lysed the effect of time on blood pressure for manual
measurements only. Each year from 1969 to 2017, dia-
stolic blood pressure increased by 0.26 (95% CI 0.10 –
0.43) mmHg, p= 0.003. Systolic blood pressure rose by
0.12 (95% CI −0.09, 0.33) mmHg per annum, but the
rise was not statistically significant ( p= 0.256). Differ-
ences were not affected by gestational age.
Data was available from studies to allow us to assess
the effects of parity on systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure. Nulliparous and parous women did not differ in ei-
ther systolic blood pressure, mean (95% CI) difference −
0.32 ( −7.7, 7.1) mmHg, p= 0.927, or diastolic blood
pressure, mean (95% CI) difference 1.30 ( −5.2, 7.8)
mmHg, p= 0.671, (Additional file 2: Figure S4).
We could not adjust for maternal characteristics, such
as age and weight, as such data were often missing or re-
ported using different summary measures at different
gestational ages.
Sensitivity analyses
Excluding outlying studies (with means lying outside of
the predictive interval) reduced the number of studies by
a maximum of five studies for studies of blood pressure.
As all the outlying studies were “high outliers ”, the mean
estimates of systolic and diastolic blood pressure wereLoerup et al. BMC Medicine          (2019) 17:167 Page 6 of 12Fig. 3 Mean heart rate (solid black line), with 95% CI (red band) by gestational age (longitudinal model). Trajectories of individual studies are also

tational ages remained the same (Additional file 2: Table
S5b). This analysis also removed the one relatively small
study where blood pressure appeared to decrease toward
the end of pregnancy [ 49]. No studies of heart rate had
means outlying the predictive interval.
Analysing only studies with a quality score above 50%
reduced the number of studies for analysis from 34 to
12 for blood pressure and from 13 to 7 for heart rate.
We found little change in mean estimates of blood pres-
sure (though systolic blood pressure fell marginally in
trimester 2), or heart rate, and measures of heterogeneity
remained above 95% (Additional file 2: Table S5c).
Discussion
Our study synthesises the available evidence to describe
changes in blood pressure and heart rate during preg-
nancy. As far as we are aware, this has not previously
been done. We show that systolic blood pressure rises
by 5.6 (95% CI 4.0, 7.2) mmHg between 10 and 40 weeks
gestation (with a possible slight drop of around 1 mmHg
in trimester 2 when only higher-quality studies were in-
cluded). Unlike systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood
pressure is lowest at 21 weeks gestation, rising by 6.9 (CI
6.2, 7.5) mmHg by 40 weeks. Mean diastolic blood pres-
sures were on average 4.9 (0.8, 8.9) mmHg lower when
measured using automated techniques than when using
manual methods. There is no difference in either systolic
or diastolic blood pressure between nulliparous and par-
ous women. Over 48 years, average diastolic blood pres-
sures rose by 0.26 (95% CI 0.10 –0.43) mmHg per year.
Heart rate rises by 7.6 (95% CI 1.8 –13.4) beats per mi-
nute through pregnancy.
Our synthesis brings together more blood pressure
and heart rate data from more pregnant women than
has previously been done. This increases our under-
standing of the trends that occur during pregnancy. It
also shows the large between-study heterogeneity,
emphasising the importance of not simply taking results
from a single study. Consequently, our mean estimates
were imprecise (95% CI width was around 5 mmHg for
blood pressure and 9 beats per minute for heart rate).
We did not meta-analyse other centile estimates for
blood pressure and heart rate (for example 5th or 95th).
As most studies did not report centiles of the distribu-
tions, approximations would need to be made, using as-
sumptions about data distributions. The precision would
likely have been lower than at the means, resulting in
wide confidence intervals, with little clinical value. Such
an analysis would have been imprecise and potentially
misleading.
As with many meta-analyses, combining these data is
complex. Included studies were of mixed methodological
quality. We identified three aspects of particularconcern: Firstly, a lack of accuracy in measuring and
reporting of gestational age. Secondly, only a minority of
studies reported using automated blood pressure meas-
urement devices ratified for use in pregnancy. This
means that we cannot ascertain whether the differences
between blood pressures measured with manual sphyg-
momanometers and automatic methods would have
been present if automatic methods ratified for use in
pregnancy had been used. Thirdly, many studies insuffi-
ciently defined the population studied. These methodo-
logical weaknesses may have contributed to the range of
possible mean blood pressures for any gestational age in
our analyses. They may also partly account for the het-
erogeneity we found. Sensitivity analyses to account for
quality and outlying studies had little effect in reducing
heterogeneity. Further exploration of the sources of the
heterogeneity was prevented by a lack of consistent
reporting of the additional variables that would be re-
quired. The substantial between-study difference in
blood pressure and heart rates at all gestational ages cre-
ates uncertainty around our mean values, but is less of a
problem when analysing trends across pregnancy and
time and when considering differences between meas-
urement methods.
We investigated the effect of methodological quality in
two ways, by undertaking a pre-specified analysis exclud-
ing outlying studies and by excluding studies scoring less
than 50% on quality assessment. As all the outlying stud-
ies were “high outliers ”, the mean estimates of systolic
and diastolic blood pressure were decreased by about 1
mmHg, but the pattern across gestational ages remained
the same (Additional file 2: Table S5b). Excluding stud-
ies with a quality assessment score of less than 50% had
little change in mean estimates of blood pressure
(though systolic blood pressure fell marginally in trimes-
ter 2), or heart rate (Additional file 2: Table S5c).
We planned to estimate blood pressure and heart rate
trends for normal pregnancies, accepting that definitions
of normal pregnancy vary. Where participants subse-
quently developed complications, we included their
readings. As a consequence, we kept in women who de-
veloped pre-eclampsia or gestational hypertension whilst
in the original study. As most studies did not present
data excluding these participants, we could not derive
mean values for populations who remained “normal ”at
delivery.
We combined longitudinal and cross-sectional study
data. Blood pressures from longitudinal studies are not
independent, in contrast to cross-sectional studies where
blood pressures from different women at different points
in pregnancy are independent. To avoid underestimating
the precision of our estimates by ignoring the longitu-
dinal correlations, we used the random time-effects
method proposed by Ishak et al. for the meta-analysis ofLoerup et al. BMC Medicine          (2019) 17:167 Page 8 of 12summary data. This model addresses the dependencies
between longitudinal data points through the inclusion
of random time effects between studies. Additionally,
the random time-effects method accounts for the exact
measurement time points of the included studies. We
could not include within-study correlations as none of
the included studies reported these. Maternal age and
weight were often not presented, and where presented,
the gestational age at which they were reported was in-
consistent, preventing exploration of their effect on the
temporal increase in diastolic blood pressure. The in-
cluded studies came from a wide range of countries
(Additional file 2: Table S4), including a wide range of
ethnicities. However, our results may not be generalis-
able across all ethnic groups. Given the large number of
included patients, it appears unlikely that our pre-speci-
fied plan to exclude studies with less than 50 partici-
pants significantly affected our findings.
Our findings remain compatible with the known in-
crease in myocardial alpha receptors (resulting in in-
creased heart rate), increased plasma volume and
decreased systemic vascular resistance that occur in
pregnancy [ 9]. However, in comparison to the 5-mmHg
mid-pregnancy drop for systolic blood pressure and 10 –
15-mmHg drop for diastolic blood pressure previously
suggested [ 7–9], the changes we found were small (with
little change in systolic blood pressure and a 2 –3-mmHg
drop in diastolic blood pressure). It is possible that blood
pressure drops in pregnancy before most of the included
studies took measurements [ 42,70]. However, our low-
est mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were
similar to those reported for normal young, non-preg-
nant female populations [ 71] and a study used as evi-
dence of an early drop is included in our model [ 42].
Heart rate rose by 7.6 (95% CI 1.8, 13.4) beats/min ra-
ther than the 10 –20 beats/min core texts commonly
suggest [ 7–9]. Taken with other work showing smaller
changes than previously though [ 38,43,51], these find-
ings should alter current teaching, allowing more reliable
assessment of pregnant women. Previous work in adult
early warning scores shows that relatively small changes
in thresholds have large changes in the ability of a score
to detect deterioration [ 13,14]. Published maternal early
warning scores commonly have ranges for alerting
thresholds of 10 mmHg for blood pressure and 10 beats
per minute for heart rate [ 11,72]. Our study shows that
the normal changes in pregnancy account for over half
these ranges. It seems likely that detection of acute de-
terioration in pregnancy could be improved by taking
account of gestation. Equally, recognition of women at
risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may be im-
proved by taking account of these patterns [ 73]. Prior to
our study, possibly the best evidence for blood pressure
patterns in pregnancy came from a single-centre studyundertaken over 20 years ago [ 38]. Data from this work
contributes to our study. The evidence for patterns in
heart rate was even more limited. Blood pressure differ-
ences between nulliparous and parous women were
small, in line with previous findings [ 38], and did not
reach statistical significance.
Our finding of increasing diastolic blood pressure over
the 48 years in which these studies have been undertaken
is previously unknown. We did not find a study with data
over a sufficient period to add to this finding. Increasing
average maternal age [ 74–76] and/or weight [ 38,77]m a y
provide part of the explanation. These changes contribute
to the uncertainty of our overall estimates.
The mean diastolic blood pressure was lower when
measured using automated methods than when mea-
sured manually. Previously, several automated monitors
have been found to underestimate diastolic blood
pressure in pre-eclampsia [ 78–80]. Although we in-
cluded women who subsequently developed pre-eclamp-
sia, their contribution to our overall effect will be small
as they form a small proportion of the total cohort and
contributed readings prior to developing pre-eclampsia.
Importantly, the mean difference is just lower than the
minimum validation requirement for automated devices,
suggesting that many of the devices used would not
achieve this criteria [ 81]. The difference between manual
and automated measurement could commonly change
the weight applied to a blood pressure measurement in
early warning scores. As many of the automated tech-
niques were not known to be certified for use in preg-
nancy and several automated devices have been
validated for use in pregnancy [ 82–85], it may be that
the problem could be resolved by only using certified de-
vices. Alternatively, the difference may in part be ex-
plained by use of the fourth rather than fifth phase to
determine diastolic pressure manually.
Future studies should define gestational age precisely,
recruit well-defined populations and for blood pressure
only use devices ratified for use in pregnancy. For blood
pressure, the differences between automated and manual
methods across pregnancy need exploring with automated
methods approved for use in pregnancy. The changes in
diastolic blood pressure across five decades suggest nor-
mal ranges should be regularly revisited. Finally, the im-
pact of using gestation-specific centiles to allow earlier
detection of the unwell mother requires investigation.
Conclusions
Gestational changes in blood pressure and heart rate
should be taken into account when assessing pregnant
women, but heterogeneity between studies prevents the
production of gestation-specific evidence-based normal
ranges. Assessment of blood pressure need not differ be-
tween nulliparous and parous women. AutomaticallyLoerup et al. BMC Medicine          (2019) 17:167 Page 9 of 12measured diastolic blood pressures are lower than those
measured manually. A consistent measurement system
should be used through pregnancy. Decreases in blood
pressure mid-pregnancy and increases in heart rate
through pregnancy are smaller than previously thought.
Taken with other work, these findings should contribute
to more reliable assessment of pregnant women. In-
creases in diastolic blood pressures recorded over the
last half century show contemporary data is required to
define normal ranges for current practice.

8Conclusions 
The analysed policies have areas of consensus amongst their prac-
tices, but relevant variations in care provision were identified. These 
would not be explained by essential health financing differences or 
levels of development since the countries are comparable, yet they can 
have an impact on perinatal outcomes, pregnancy, and maternity 
experience, and/or costs. Some recommendations are not based on the 
latest best available evidence, or are outdated, and need updating. 
As previously mentioned, the provision and extent of antenatal care 
can affect the health and well-being of women and infants. Good out-
comes are directly linked with effective and affordable interventions. It 
is crucial and an ethical necessity that health policies are carefully 
developed, up to date, and based on the best available evidence, to 
ensure that all women and babies have the opportunity to achieve the 
highest standard of health. 
Research correlating these results with perinatal outcomes and cost 
evaluation could be valuable to optimise guidance on antenatal care and 
consequently health care outcomes. Similarly, some aspects of care, 
screening (e.g., Gestational Diabetes Mellitus, Group B Streptococcus) , and 
others, need further rigorous studies to obtain evidence of higher quality 
to inform recommendations.
