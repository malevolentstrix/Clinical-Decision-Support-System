Cost-effectiveness analysis ABSTRACT  
Background: Health economic assessments are used to determine whether the resources needed to generate net 
benefit from a screening programme, driven by multiple complex benefits and harms, are justifiable. We sys-
tematically identified the benefits and harms incorporated within economic assessments evaluating antenatal 
and newborn screening programmes. 
Methods: For this systematic review and thematic analysis, we searched the published and grey literature from 
January 2000 to January 2021. Studies that included an economic evaluation of an antenatal or newborn 
screening programme in an OECD country were eligible. We identified benefits and harms using an integrative 
descriptive analysis, and illustrated a thematic framework. (Systematic review registration PROSPERO, 
CRD42020165236). 
Findings: The searches identified 52,244 articles and reports and 336 (242 antenatal and 95 newborn) were 
included. Eighty-six subthemes grouped into seven themes were identified: 1) diagnosis of screened for condi -
tion, 2) life years and health status adjustments, 3) treatment, 4) long-term costs, 5) overdiagnosis, 6) pregnancy 
loss, and 7) spillover effects on family members. Diagnosis of screened for condition (115 studies, 47.5%), life- 
years and health status adjustments (90 studies, 37.2%) and treatment (88 studies, 36.4%) accounted for most of 
the benefits and harms evaluating antenatal screening. The same themes accounted for most of the benefits and 
harms included in studies assessing newborn screening. Overdiagnosis and spillover effects tended to be ignored. 
Interpretation: Our proposed framework can be used to guide the development of future health economic as-
sessments evaluating antenatal and newborn screening programmes, to prevent exclusion of important potential 
benefits and harms.

1.Introduction 
Antenatal and newborn screening programmes can facilitate earlier 
detection and diagnosis of health conditions, enabling timely care and 
treatment for pregnant women and their newborns. A successful 
screening programme maximises benefits and minimises harms to all the 
relevant stakeholders affected by screening (Raffle and JM, 2019). 
Antenatal screening aims to identify conditions early, allowing pregnant 
women and their partners to make informed choices about pregnancy 
management, including termination. The identification of conditions is 
also crucial in newborn screening for the appropriate care and imple -
mentation of relevant interventions to maximise survival and quality of 
life of the newborn. 
Antenatal and newborn screening programmes are associated with 
many benefits and harms. Harms of screening associated with false 
positive and false negative results include unnecessary additional re-
sources to conduct further investigations, adverse psychological and 
physical effects and legal claims, as well as decreased trust and confi -
dence in the health care system (Petticrew et al., 2000). In antenatal 
screening, when a decision to continue a pregnancy is made after a true 
positive result, a potential screening benefit is the time it offers expec -
tant parents to prepare for the birth of a child with a clinical condition. 
An informed decision to terminate a pregnancy can also follow a true 
positive result, but this can lead to long-lasting psychosocial sequelae for 
women and their partners, affecting their quality of life and their future 
pregnancy choices (Davies et al., 2005; Fuller et al., 2021; Kaimal et al., 
2015; Korenromp et al., 2005; Kuppermann et al., 2004, 2016; 
Woolf-King et al., 2017). The use of genome-wide sequencing for 
newborn screening presents an opportunity to identify and treat or 
prevent severe health conditions, but could cause overdiagnosis, over-
treatment and greater uncertainty if not assessed properly (Friedman 
et al., 2017; Phillips et al., 2018). 
Population screening programmes are evaluated by national 
screening committees using independent evidence-based recommenda -
tions relevant to the jurisdiction that may adopt the programme. The 
United Kingdom National Screening Committee (UK NSC) and the 
United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) are examples of 
screening committees using such approaches. The recommendation to 
adopt a screening programme on a national scale is based on the premise 
that the benefits associated with screening outweigh the harms once 
implemented. In the UK, for instance, the UK NSC requires evidence of 
these benefits and harms, and data demonstrating that the screening 
programme represents value for money. The latter is determined using a 
health economic assessment confirming that the additional costs of 
implementing a screening programme are justified by the additional 
benefits achieved. Decision-analytic based economic assessments can 
account for the abovementioned benefits and harms through outcome 
measures (e.g. quality-adjusted life years [QALYs]), model inputs and the structure of the decision-problem (Caro et al., 2012). There is 
established guidance on best practices for economic modelling for 
screening programmes in general (Weinstein et al., 2003), but this 
guidance does not address the challenges of how to incorporate the 
breadth of potentially relevant benefits and harms into a single assess -
ment, and does not specifically focus on antenatal and newborn 
screening. Guidance in this area, therefore, remains limited (Karnon 
et al., 2007). Failure to incorporate all relevant benefits and harms when 
assessing the cost-effectiveness of antenatal and newborn screening 
programmes may lead screening committees to make decisions based on 
sub-optimal evidence. 
In this study, we report the first systematic review of the benefits and 
harms of antenatal and newborn screening adopted by different types of 
health economic assessments in the published and grey literature. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Overview 
We used the PRISMA 2020 checklist (Page et al., 2021) when 
reporting the methods and results of this systematic review. The review 
protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020165236) and pub-
lished on January 13, 2020 (Png et al., 2021). This review is based on 
data available from secondary sources and published materials; hence, 
ethics committee approval or written informed consent was not 
required. 
2.2. Search strategy and selection criteria 
The PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome and 
Study design) framework was used to develop the study eligibility 
criteria (Table 1) and applied to the literature searches. The search 
strategy (Supplementary Table 1) was developed in collaboration with 
an information specialist (NR) and limited to studies published from 
January 1, 2000 onwards. A simplified search strategy based on the 
Cochrane guidelines was applied to the grey literature search (Higgins 
et al., 2019). Translation of the simplified search terms for non-English 
websites was performed by professional translators. 
The published literature was searched using the following electronic 
bibliographic databases: Medline (OvidSP)[1946-present], Embase 
(OvidSP)[1974-present], NHS Economic Evaluation Database (via 
CRDWeb https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/CRDWeb/)[Inception to March 
31, 2015], EconLit (Proquest)[1969-present], Science Citation Index, 
Social Science Citation Index and Conference Proceedings Citation Index 
– Science (Web of Science Core Collection)[1945-present], CINAHL 
(EBSCOHost)[1982-present] and PsycINFO (OvidSP)[1806-present]. 
SCOPUS (Elsevier) was used to run forward and backward citation 
searches once relevant studies were identified. The academic electronic 
database search was supplemented by manual reference searching of 
bibliographies, contacts with experts in the field and author searching. 
Only studies assessing screening programmes in at least one of the Or-
ganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) coun-
tries were included. A full search of the published literature was 
conducted on January 22, 2021 (Supplementary Table 1). Identified 
published studies were exported to EndNote version X9 (Clarivate, 
Philadelphia, United States of America, 2019) for deduplication and 
then imported into Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation, n.d.) 
for screening. Screening of titles and abstracts, and subsequently of 
full-text articles identified in the published literature, was performed 
using the eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers (MEP and 
MY). In addition, MEP assessed 100% and SR 10% of the grey literature 
during the screening process. Disagreements related to the screening 
process between the two reviewers were resolved by discussion and 
involvement of other members of the review team (OR-A and SP) if 
necessary. For non-English language papers, Google Translate (Google, 
Mountain View, California, USA) was used to translate relevant M.E. Png et al.

3documents. 
The list of sources of grey literature searched was informed by a 
recent systematic review of national policy recommendations on 
newborn screening that identified around 30 websites of national and 
regional screening organisations with documentation about antenatal 
and/or newborn screening recommendations (Taylor-Phillips et al., 
2018 ). This was widened to cover websites reported by the Health Grey 
Matters checklist and those for national and regional screening organi -
sations, health technology assessment agencies, paediatrics organisa -
tions, and obstetrics and gynaecology societies in OECD countries, as 
well as international decision-making bodies, such as the World Health 
Organization, the European Council, European Commission and the 
European Observer (CADTH: Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technol -
ogies in Health, 2014 ; Taylor-Phillips et al., 2018 ). A customised 
web-scraping tool that used the Google search engine was built using 
Python to directly query the stated websites in January/February 2021 
using English search terms and translated search terms for non-English 
websites, as well as to automate the data extraction processes. The 
grey literature that was identified was exported to Microsoft Excel for 
deduplication. We refer to ‘articles ’ and ‘reports ’ in our presentation of 
results when referring to the published and grey literature, respectively. 
2.3. Data analysis 
A data extraction sheet, which was piloted and refined using ten 
randomly selected studies identified in the academic electronic data-
bases, was created following recommendations from the Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins et al., 
2019 ). As we had anticipated a large number of articles to data extract and after consulting our Independent Oversight Committee members 
and information specialist (NR), a selection of the papers/reports was 
extracted independently by two health economists (MEP and MY), fol-
lowed by a reconciliation process. High level of agreement between MEP 
and MY was observed after assessing 10% of the papers/reports during 
this reconciliation process. The rest of the published literature was 
singly extracted by the two reviewers (MEP and MY). The grey literature 
was extracted by one reviewer (MEP). Any disagreement was resolved 
by discussion and involvement of other members of the review team 
(OR-A and SP) if necessary. The list of variables extracted from each 
article and report included at the final stage of the review process was 
finalised following the piloting and refinement of the data extraction 
sheet. 
The data extraction form consisted of two parts: 
1)A section that contained items from the Consolidated Health Eco-
nomic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist (Huser -
eau et al., 2013 ), modified where applicable to align with our 
research focus. This included: bibliographic details; condition(s) 
screened; approaches for measuring and valuing health outcomes; 
the journal impact factor quartile during the year that the article was 
published, obtained from Clarivate Analytics and SCImago as an 
indicator of interest in the topic by journal editors; whether the au-
thors made any policy recommendation based on their economic 
evaluation evidence; and whether the authors might have had any 
potential conflicts of interest in promoting their screening pro-
gramme or mechanism (defined as a study that was funded by an 
industry sponsor, unless it was an unrestricted grant, and at least one 
of the authors being clearly employed by the industry sponsor).  
2) A bespoke form created by the research team to extract benefits and 
harms adopted by economic assessments evaluating screening pro-
grammes. This form was created de novo as we could not find any 
previous examples in the published literature. A description of the 
consequences as reported by authors by screening test outcome (i.e. 
true positives, false positives, true negatives and false negatives) and 
source (i.e. probability, cost or outcome) was captured and cat-
egorised as either a benefit or a harm. We also recorded the stage of 
the disease pathway at which the screening test was administered 
and the phase(s) of the screening programme using categorisations 
from recent guidance (Raffle and JM, 2019 ). The form also recorded 
whether the structure of decision-analytical models had been re-
ported, and any consequences associated with treatment if included. 
Since only aggregated data and no effect sizes were sought, we did 
not assess the risk of bias or conduct a formal meta-analysis. Instead, the 
reporting quality of articles and reports (excluding conference abstracts) 
was assessed using the CHEERS checklist (Husereau et al., 2013 ). The 
items include title and abstract; background and objectives; target 
population and subgroups; setting and location; study perspective; 
comparators; time horizon; discount rate; choice of health outcomes; 
measurement of effectiveness; measurement and valuation of 
preference-based outcomes; estimation of resources and costs; currency, 
price date and conversion; choice of model; assumptions; analytical 
methods; study parameters; incremental costs and outcomes; charac -
terizing of uncertainty; characterizing of heterogeneity; study findings, 
limitations, generalizability, and current knowledge; source of funding; 
and conflicts of interest. These items were considered as ‘satisfied ’ if 
reported in full or ‘not satisfied ’ if not reported or partially reported. 
We used the information captured in the bespoke form to create a 
framework of benefits and harms adopted by health economic assess -
ments using a process of grouping themes into categories derived from 
information extracted about consequences in the bespoke form (Morse, 
2008 ). An integrative descriptive analysis (Sandelowski, 2010 ) of the 
collated themes within each category was then conducted, resulting in a 
thematic framework of benefits and harms consisting of a primary theme 
and up to four levels of subtheme(s). In the first step, the description of Table 1

bThis includes actual and proposed, e.g., hypothetical screening programmes 
as well as any aspect of a screening programme (defined as a whole system of 
activities needed to deliver high quality screening), for example, the perfor -
mance of screening test. M.E. Png et al.

4consequences was categorised into specific themes by ST-P. This pool of 
themes was the starting point of an iterative process where members of 
the study team (ST-P, MEP, OR-A, and SP) merged, separated and 
refined the wording of themes and subthemes. During this step, special 
attention was paid to avoid overlapping of broad themes. The iterative 
process was maintained until consensus was reached among the study 
team (ST-P, MEP, OR-A, and SP). Articles and reports were categorised 
into themes and subtheme(s) according to the condition and screening 
type. Bar charts were generated to illustrate the thematic framework 
across and by medical condition(s). 
Role of the funding source 
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data collection, 
data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. 
3.Results 
3.1. Systematic review 
We identified 52,244 articles and reports from the searches of the 
published and grey literature. Among the 16,052 records that were 
sought for retrieval based on identification of records via other methods 
(i.e. grey literature), 7464 records were non-English (46.5%). Thirty- 
nine studies of the non-English records were assessed for eligibility 
with five subsequently included in the data extraction phase. A total of 
336 records (310 articles and 26 reports) were included in the systematic review. One HTA report included two separate economic 
evaluations that were separated into two different reports, resulting in 
337 outputs. Study selection and reasons for exclusion as well as data 
extraction of the ancillary form are summarised in the PRISMA diagram 
(Fig. 1). The list of studies excluded is summarised in Supplementary 
Table 2. The number of articles and reports are presented in Supple -
mentary Fig. 1 by year of publication and screening type; no general 
trend was observed between the year of publication and screening type. 
Characteristics of the included articles and reports are presented in 
Table 2. The majority of those included were journal articles (228, 
67.7%) with almost half conducted in the United States of America (109, 
32.2%) or the United Kingdom (43, 12.7%). For the majority of articles 
and reports, further information was required to determine if the au-
thors had potential conflicts of interest (221, 65.6%). Furthermore, the 
authors did not make any recommendation about the adoption of the 
screening programme based on the economic evidence generated for the 
majority of the articles and reports (273, 81.0%). The majority of the 
articles were published in top quartile medical journals (i.e. quartile 
one; 129, 38.3%). 
The characteristics of screening programmes and populations in the 
included articles and reports are summarised in Supplementary Table 3. 
There were 173 (71.5%) studies on antenatal screening and 63 (66.3%) 
studies on newborn screening that did not state the setting of the 
screening. The majority of the antenatal studies did not state the 
women ’s gestational stage at the time of screening (168, 65.4%). The 
majority of the studies were targeted at the general population of 
pregnant women (197, 57.1%) or infants (91, 26.4%). Many studies

evaluations that were separated into two different reports, resulting in 242 outputs from the 241 records. M.E. Png et al.

5were investigations at the symptomless stage with pathologically 
definable change present (303, 89.9%) or involved all phases of the 
screening process (162, 48.1%). 
The medical conditions investigated are summarised in Supple -
mentary Table 4. Genetic conditions and infectious diseases (153, 
63.2%) were the main areas covered by the articles and reports assessing 
antenatal screening. Metabolic and structural conditions (57, 60.0%) 
were the main areas covered by health economic assessments evaluating 
newborn screening programmes. 
The methodological characteristics of the health economic assess -
ments are summarised in Table 3. Decision analytical models were 
employed in 272 (81.0%) of the articles and reports whilst 117 (43.0%) 
of all articles and reports used a lifetime time horizon. Almost half of them conducted a cost-utility analysis reporting quality-adjusted life 
years (QALYs) (167, 49.4%). The costing perspective adopted was not 
stated in 117 (33.7%) articles and reports. Maternal preference-based 
outcomes (QALYs; disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) were re-
ported in 94 (72.9%) antenatal screening evaluations whereas infant 
preference-based outcomes were reported in 34 (89.5%) newborn 
screening evaluations. 
Reporting quality assessed using the CHEERS checklist was hetero -
geneous among the 264 full length articles and reports (as summarised 
in Supplementary Table 5). The top five items not satisfied among the 
studies for both antenatal and newborn screening programmes were 
‘Abstract ’ (229, 86.7%), ‘Time horizon ’ (220, 83.3%), ‘Choice of model ’ 
(208, 78.8%), ‘Discount rate’ (183, 69.3 and ‘Study funding, limitation, 
generalizability, and current knowledge ’ (182, 68.9%). The top five Table 2

3.2. Thematic synthesis 
We identified 86 unique descriptions of consequences across all ar-
ticles and reports from our bespoke extraction form. Our thematic 
analysis resulted in seven core themes of benefits and harms with each 
core theme including up to four levels of subtheme(s). An abridged 
version of the thematic framework with a description of each theme and 
key examples is presented in Table 4 with the full version up to sub-
theme level 4 presented in Supplementary Table 6. 
The benefits and harms incorporated within health economic as-
sessments are presented in Fig. 2 by screening type using the thematic 
framework. Limited information about benefits and harms could be 
extracted from 81 (33.5%) out of the 242 antenatal screening evalua -
tions and 19 (20.0%) out of the 95 newborn screening evaluations to 
inform our bespoke form. These included 51 out of the 81 (63.0%) 
antenatal screening evaluations and 11 out of the 19 (57.9%) newborn 
screening evaluations described in conference abstracts. Across all 
conditions in antenatal screening in Fig. 2 (n 242), 115 (47.5%) 
incorporated benefits and harms related to the diagnosis of screened for 
condition (theme 1). Ninety (37.2%) of evaluations included benefits 
and harms related to life-years and health status adjustments (theme 2). 
Eighty-eight (36.4%) of the antenatal screening evaluations included 
benefits and harms associated with treatment (theme 3). In general, for 
antenatal screening, benefits and harms associated with the long-term 
costs of screened for conditions (theme 4) was adopted in 68 (28.1%) 
of the evaluations. Only 21 out of the 242 (8.7%) antenatal screening 
evaluations incorporated benefits and harms from all of themes 1 to 4. 
Newborn screening, as shown in Fig. 2, had 63 (66.3%) studies that 
incorporated benefits and harms related to the diagnosis of screened for 
condition (theme 1). Fifty-one (53.7%) evaluations included life-years 
and health status adjustment related benefits and harms (theme 2). 
Forty (42.1%) of the antenatal screening evaluations included benefits 
and harms associated with treatment (theme 3). Benefits and harms 
associated with the long-term costs of screened for conditions (theme 4) 
were only adopted in 37 (38.9%) of the evaluations. Only 17 out of the 
95 (17.9%) newborn screening evaluations adopted benefits and harms 
from all of themes 1 to 4. Benefits and harms related to overdiagnosis (5, 
1.5%) and spillover effects (1, 0.3%) were largely absent from the 
studies. 
Supplementary Table 7 summarises the benefits and harms adopted 
in the articles and reports for specific conditions. Health economic as-
sessments evaluating antenatal screening programmes for infectious 
diseases adopted the broadest spectrum of benefits and harms compared 
to the other conditions. 
4.Discussion 
To our knowledge, this review is the first of its kind focusing on the 
adoption of benefits and harms by health economic assessments of 
antenatal and newborn screening programmes. Previous work has 
focused on the identification of methodological challenges and the 
development of good practice guidelines in the conduct of health eco-
nomic assessments (Cacciatore et al., 2020 ; Karnon et al., 2007 ; Langer 
et al., 2012 ). However, this is the first systematic review to identify 
benefits and harms of these studies in OECD countries. Almost half of the 
included articles were published in first-quartile journals, indicating 
interest in the topic by high-impact journals. Most of the economic ev-
idence of antenatal screening programmes focused on screening for 
genetic conditions or infectious diseases, whilst that surrounding 
newborn screening programmes primarily focused on screening for Table 4

7metabolic or structural conditions. 
We found clear evidence that decision-analytic models represent the 
main vehicle for the conduct of these studies, unsurprisingly given the 
nature of the evidence synthesis needed. Almost half of the articles and 
reports used standard health economic measures of QALYs or DALYs to 
measure the health benefits of the screening programmes. Lifetime ho-
rizons are important to understand the costs and consequences of these 
screening programmes in the long run, but such an approach was 
adopted by less than half of the studies. Current lack of long-term data to 
inform this aspect of economic evaluations partly explains this result 
(Phillips et al., 2018 ), but it highlights a serious limitation of these 
studies. It also indicates that these studies did not adhere to recognised 
methods guidelines for the conduct of economic evaluations for the purposes of assessing the value for money of screening programmes 
(National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2013 ). 
Our thematic analysis summarised a wide range of benefits and 
harms adopted by these studies and summarised them into seven core 
themes. There is no consistency on the selection of benefits and harms 
across and within conditions suggesting that additional guidance is 
needed in this field. In general, articles and reports assessing antenatal 
and newborn screening programmes have considered benefits and 
harms that reflect the processes of identifying a condition in their health 
economic assessments. This includes, for example, cases correctly 
identified or missed or the number of unnecessary tests due to false 
positives. This result is not surprising because benefits and harms 
associated with the diagnosis of screened for conditions provide the first 
line of clinical evidence about these programmes and are of key interest 
to screening organisations. Around half of the articles and reports 
evaluating newborn screening programmes across all conditions did not 
consider benefits and harms associated with life years and health status 
adjustments. Our review also found that benefits and harms identified as 
important by screening agencies and international health organisations, 
including overdiagnosis and spillover effects on family members, have 
rarely been adopted by these economic evaluations (Raffle and JM, 
2019 ; World Health Organization, 2020 ). In the case of spillover effects, 
the only relevant subtheme identified was benefits to parents that 
inform future reproductive decisions from discovering carrier status as a 
consequence of the child ’s diagnosis (Shermock et al., 2005 ). It is 
difficult to understand why authors have tended to exclude these rele-
vant themes in their economic analyses because such information is 
rarely reported. In the case of spillover effects, i.e. the impact of a pa-
tient ’s health and wellbeing on family members and informal caregivers, 
there have been several calls by academics to routinely include these 
effects in the evaluation of adult and child health interventions, Table 4 (continued )

Png et al.

8indicating that this is not an issue specific to evaluations of antenatal and 
newborn screening programmes (Brouwer et al., 2009; Brouwer, 2018). 
Access to appropriate data sources to inform model parameters, and 
time and budget constraints are possible reasons for the omission of 
overdiagnosis and spillover effects in these studies. However, this should 
be confirmed by future research and guidance on the conduct of these 
studies in practice. 
Authors did not generally refer to “benefits” and “harms” when 
describing the utilities and dis-utilities included in their evaluations. In 
addition, what constitutes a benefit or harm depends on the perspective 
of the particular stakeholder involved in the decision-making. For 
instance, a reduction in the number of infants born with a condition 
through pregnancy termination may be seen by some as a societal 
benefit in economic terms, due to health care savings and reduced so-
cietal comorbidity. However, this may well be considered a devastating 
harm for families who value living with an infant with a condition. 
Therefore, we had to extract and interpret detailed information about 
the consequences included in the studies and reports for the thematic 
analysis from a neutral ethical perspective when categorising benefits 
and harms together into unique themes. It is worthwhile noting that the 
terms benefits and harms are commonly used by national screening 
committees to communicate their decisions about implementation of 
these programmes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021; 
UK National Screening Committee, 2021). We hope that our work en-
courages other health economists to think about the potential breadth of 
benefits and harms that can be captured within standard health metrics, 
such as QALYs, when designing, presenting and communicating their 
work. 
A key strength of this review includes the focus on a comprehensive 
set of antenatal and newborn screening programmes across OECD 
countries. We did not restrict our searches to English-only records to 
avoid language bias, and did not restrict our searches to the published 
literature only in order to avoid publication bias. We have also identified 
a thematic framework of benefits and harms that can act as a starting 
point for researchers when considering the benefits and harms to be 
included in their analyses in the future. However, this study has its 
limitations. We did not dual extract data as currently recommended 
(Higgins et al., 2019) due to the large amount of information to extract 
from the final set of included articles and reports, and the timelines 
allowed to complete the project. For practical purposes and quality 
assurance, dual data extraction was performed for 10% of the papers 
after consulting our Independent Oversight Committee and information 
specialist (NR) using a reconciliation process that ended in a high-level 
agreement between reviewers. We also re-ran our search strategies up to 
November 22, 2021 and an additional 18 articles had been published 
since January 2021. To incorporate this more recent literature, one 
assessor (MEP) extracted the consequences included in these new arti-
cles using our bespoke form, and no new themes of benefits and harms 
were identified (Supplementary Table 8), demonstrating the robustness 
of our framework. It is also possible that we have missed important 
consequences of benefits and harms associated with these types of 
screening as our thematic framework is informed by already completed 
studies. There is currently ongoing qualitative work evaluating the 
spectrum of benefits and harms of importance to stakeholders affected 
by antenatal and newborn screening, which will inform whether our 
framework needs expanding or contracting (UK National Institute for 
Health and Care Research NIHR Funding and Awards, 2022). Therefore, 
our framework should be used with caution and as a tool to guide dis-
cussions during the design of these studies and should not be employed 
as a checklist. 
In conclusion, we have conducted the first systematic review iden-
tifying the benefits and harms incorporated into economic evaluations 
of antenatal and newborn screening programmes. We found that many 
of these studies did not adhere to the most recent guidance on the 
conduct of economic evaluations and that many benefits and harms 
considered important by screening agencies, including overdiagnosis, are often overlooked (UK National Screening Committee, 2021). Our 
work suggests that there is an immediate need to provide guidance for 
researchers conducting these types of studies in the future. Our proposed 
framework of benefits and harms can be used as a starting point to guide 
the development of health economic assessments evaluating antenatal 
and newborn screening for specific conditions.
